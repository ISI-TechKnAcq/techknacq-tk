        "Ehrlich (1980) gives experimental evidence supporting this view.",
        "Ehrlich's goal was to test the biasing effect of the so-called \"implicit causality\" feature (Garvey and Caramazza, 1974) of verbs such as blame in pronoun reference assignment in two-clause sentences with conjunctions other than because (which was the only conjunction used in previous work (Garvey ei al., 1976)).",
        "In her experiments, subjects were tested for their ability to identify correct referents of pronouns in three versions of six two-clause sentences (such as those in sentences (47) and (48)), where each of the sentences contained one of the conjunctions and, but, and because.",
        "It was found that subjects were significantly more accurate in determining correct referents of",
        "pronouns when the conjunction used was because or but, and therefore that the effect of implicit causality was not constant with respect to the conjunction used.",
        "While a detailed analysis of her work is beyond the scope of this paper, two generalizations that she draws as a result of her experiments are: (1) that subjects were more able to utilize 'general knowledge' in determining the referent when the conjunction used was because or but than when it was and; and (2) that hearers analyze language a clause at a time.",
        "The first of these results supports our view that semantic information required for reasoning is primarily available in the discourse model (since the representation for the first clause is integrated into the discourse model when the conjunction used is but or because); the second point supports our claim that the propositional registers hold clause-level representations.'",
        "7 In summary, our architecture also accommodates evidence supporting competing theories of how pronominal NP resolution is performed."

        "This paper presents a model for anaphoric processing that incorporates the role of establishing coherence relationships between clauses in a discourse.",
        "By postulating the existence of propositional representations in addition to a discourse model, we account for ellipsis data that has gridlocked work on the topic.",
        "Furthermore, arguments for dichotomous approaches to pronoun resolution are resolvable within this framework.",
        "It should be noted that coherence establishment is not likely to be the only discourse factor involved in integrating propositional representations into the discourse model.",
        "Therefore, the analysis described herein only indicates tendencies, as opposed to predicting cut-and-dry judgements on the basis of type of construction alone.",
        "For instance, example (49) has been judged by some speakers to be acceptable under a strict reading:18 (49) I voted for myself, and I hope you did too!",
        "Our account predicts that this case would be at least somewhat stilted due to a Condition A violation.",
        "One factor distinguishing this example from 17 Ehrlich's results with the conjunction and are mixed with respect to our theory, as in some cases her participants preferred a non-subject position referent over a subject position one.",
        "In particular, she notes that this happens when the main verb of the second clause is the stative verb be, as in Sue criticized Penny and she was gloomy.",
        "These sentences contain the result meaning of and as opposed to the parallel one.",
        "Unfortunately, Ehrlich's original data was not available at the time of this writing so an analysis distinguishing between uses of and could not be performed.",
        "18I thank an anonymous reviewer for this example.",
        "others we have discussed is the use of first and second person pronouns, and a second is the fact that the pronominal referent necessary to yield the strict reading is also present in the target clause.",
        "Future work is needed to further analyze the effects of these differences.",
        "The theory presented here evokes many other questions for future study.",
        "One such question is how the postulated representations should be further formalized, and how reasoning with these formalizations is to be performed.",
        "A second question is how this conception of discourse processing may be integrated with theories of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Webber, 1991).",
        "While we have looked primarily at two-clause structures, the ramifications that the claims have on multi-clause discourse structure require further investigation.",
        "Such studies will form the basis for further characterization of the role of coherence establishment in anaphoric processing."
