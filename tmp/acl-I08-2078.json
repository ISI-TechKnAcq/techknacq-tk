        "In this paper, we propose the use of an online training method that greatly reduces training time.",
        "Large Memory Space: The total number of features used to extract named entities from documents is very large.",
        "To extract biomedical named entities, we often need to use extra features in addition to those used in general-purpose domains, such as prefix, suffix, punctuation, and more orthographic features.",
        "We need a correspondingly large memory space for processing, exacerbating the first issue.",
        "We propose to alleviate this problem by employing a cascaded approach that divides the NER task into a segmentation task and a classification task.",

        "where C > 0 is a user-defined aggressiveness parameter and Â£ > 0 is a slack term for the training data when it is not linearly-separable.",
        "C controls the penalty of the slack term and the aggressiveness of each update step.",
        "A larger C implies a more aggressive update and hence a higher tendency to overfit.",
        "The solution to Problem (7) is where Tt = min < C,",
        "The passiveness of this algorithm comes from the fact that the parameter wt is not updated when the hinge loss for xt is zero.",
        "It can be proved that the relative loss bound on the training data (and which also bounds the number of prediction mistakes on the training data) cannot be much worse than the best fixed parameter chosen in hindsight.",
        "See (Crammer et al., 2006) for a detailed proof.",

        "The major computation difficulty in this online training comes from Equation (3).",
