        "There has been a considerable amount of work on NER in English (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003; Petasis et al., 2001; Mikheev et al., 1999).",
        "Much of the previous work on name finding is based on one of the following approaches: (1) hand-crafted or automatically acquired rules or finite state patterns (2) look up from large name lists or other specialized resources (3) data driven approaches exploiting the statistical properties of the language (statistical models).",
        "The earliest work in named-entity recognition involved hand-crafted rules based on pattern matching (Appelt et al., 1993).",
        "For instance, a sequence of capitalized words ending in \"Inc.\" is typically the name of an organization in the US, so one could implement a rule to that effect.",
        "Another example of such a rule is: Title Capitalized_word â€“ > Title Per-",
        "son_name.",
        "Developing and maintaining rules and NER involves the identification of named entities dictionaries is a costly affair and adaptation to dif-such as person names, location names, names of ferent domains is difficult.",
        "In the second approach, the NER system recognizes only the named entities stored in its lists, also called gazetteers.",
        "This approach is simple, fast, language independent and easy to re-target - just recreate the lists.",
        "However, named entities are too numerous and are constantly evolving.",
        "Even when named entities are listed in the dictionaries, it is not always easy to decide their senses.",
        "There can be semantic ambiguities.",
        "For example, \"Washington\" refers to both person name as well as place name.",
        "Statistical models have proved to be quite effective.",
        "Such models typically treat named-entity recognition as a sequence tagging problem, where each word is tagged with its entity type if it is part of an entity.",
        "Machine learning techniques are relatively independent of language and domain and no expert knowledge is needed.",
        "There has been a lot of work on NER for English employing the machine learning techniques, using both supervised learning and unsupervised learning.",
        "Unsupervised learning approaches do not require labelled training data training requires only very few seed lists and large unannotated corpora (Collins and Singer, 1999).",
        "Supervised approaches can achieve good performance when large amounts of high quality training data is available.",
        "Statistical methods such as HMM (Bikel et al., 1997; Zhou and Su, 2001), Decision tree model (Baluja et al., 2000; Isozaki, 2001), and conditional random fields (McCallum, 2003) have been used.",
        "Generative models such as Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al., 1997; Zhou and Su, 2001) have shown excellent performance on the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) dataset (Chinchor, 1997).",

        "Training data of 13,425 words has been developed manually by annotating each word as noun or not-noun.",
        "Next we have extracted the following features for each word of annotated corpus:",
        "â€¢ Morphological features: Morphological analyzer developed at University of Hyderabad over the last many years has been used to obtain the root word and the POS category for the given word.",
        "A morphological analyzer is useful in two ways.",
        "Firstly, it helps us to recognize inflected forms (which will not be listed in the dictionary) as not named entities.",
        "Secondly, word forms not recognized by morphology are likely to be named entities.",
        "â€¢ Length: This is a binary feature whose value is 1 if length of the given word is less than or equal 3 characters, otherwise 0.",
        "This is based on the observation that very short words are rarely nouns.",
        "â€¢ Stop words: A stop word list including function words has been collected from existing bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Bi-lingual dictionaries used for our experiments include C P Brown's English-Telugu dictionary (Brown, 1997), Telugu-Hindi dictionary developed at University of Hyderabad and the Telugu-English dictionary developed by V Rao Ve-muri.",

        "Initially words which have occurred 1000 times or more were selected, hand filtered and added to the stop word list.",
        "Then, words which have occurred 500 to 1000 times were looked at, hand filtered and added to the stop word list.",
        "The list now has 1731 words.",
        "If the given word belongs to this list, the feature value is 1 otherwise 0.",
        "â€¢ Affixes: Here, we use the terms prefix/suffix to mean any sequence of first/last few characters of a word, not necessarily a linguistically meaningful morpheme.",
        "The use of prefix and suffix information is very useful for highly inflected languages.",
        "Here we calculate suffixes of length from 4 characters down to 1 character and prefixes of length from 7 characters",
        "down to 1 character.",
        "Thus the total number of prefix/suffix features are 11.",
        "For example, for the word \"virigiMdi\" (broke), the suffixes are \"iMdi, Mdi, di, i\" and the prefixes are \"virigiM, virigi, virig, viri, vir, vi, v\".",

        "- If length of a word is less than or equal to 3 characters, all the affix values are ND.",
        "- If length of a word is from 4 to 6 characters, initial prefixes will be ND.",

        "â€¢ Position: This is a binary feature, whose value is 1 if the given word occurs at the end of the sentence, otherwise 0.",

        "â€¢ POS: A single dictionary file is compiled from the existing bilingual dictionaries.",
        "This file includes the head word and its Part of Speech.",
        "If a given word is available in this file, then its POS tag is taken as feature otherwise feature value is 0.",
        "â€¢ Orthographic information This is a binary feature whose value is 1 if a given word contains digits or special symbols otherwise the feature value is 0.",
        "â€¢ Suffixes A list of linguistic suffixes of verbs, adjectives and adverbs were compiled from (Murthy and J.P.L.Gywnn, 1985) to recognize not-nouns in a given sentence.",
        "This feature value is 1 if the suffix of the given word belongs to this list, otherwise it is 0.",
        "A feature vector consisting of the above features is extracted for each word in the annotated corpus.",

        "The model learned during training is used for testing.",

        "Let us define:",
        "â€¢ F2 : [wj_i, wj+i, (wj_i, wj), (wj, wj+i) and the morph tags of wj_i and wj+i].",
        "The CRF trained with the basic template F1, which consists of the current word, the feature vector of the current word and the output tag of the previous word as the features, was tested on a test data of 6,223 words and an F-measure of 91.95% was obtained.",
        "Next, we trained the CRF by taking the combination of F1 and F2.",
        "We also trained using combination of F1, F2 and F3.",
        "The performances of all 3 combinations are shown in Table-2.",
        "It may be seen that performance of the system is reducing as we increase the number ofneighbouring words as features.",
        "Adding contextual features does not help.",
        "Nouns which have already been identified in the noun identification phase are now checked for named entities.",
        "In this work, our main focus is on identifying person, place and organization names.",
        "Indian place names and person names often have some suffix or prefix clues.",
        "For example \"na:yuDu\" is a person suffix clue for identifying \"ra:ma:na:yuDu\" as a person entity and \"ba:d\" is a location suffix clue for identifying \"haidara:ba:d\", \"adila:ba:d\" etc as place entities.",
        "We have manually prepared a list of such suffixes for both persons and locations as also a list of prefixes for person names.",
        "List of organization names is also prepared manually.",
        "We have also prepared a gazetteer consisting of location names and a gazetteer of person name contexts since context lists are also very useful in identifying person names.",
        "For example, it has been observed that whenever a context word such as \"maMtri\" appears, a person name is likely to follow.",
        "Regular expressions are used to identify person entities like \"en.rame:S\" and organization entities which are in acronym form such as \"Ti.Di.pi\", \"bi.je.pi\" etc.",
        "Initially one file of the corpus is tagged using these seed lists and patterns.",
        "Then we manually check and tag the unidentified named entities.",
        "These new named entities are also added to the corresponding gazetteers and the relevant contexts are added to their corresponding lists.",
        "Some new rules are also observed during manual tagging of unidentified names.",
        "Here is an example of a rule:",
        "\"if word[i] is NOUN and word[i-1] belongs to the person context list then word[i] is person name\".",
        "Currently the gazetteers include 1346 location names, 221 organization names, and small lists of prefixes, suffixes and other contextual cues that signal the presence of named entities, their types, or their beginning or ending.",
        "Using these lists and rules, we then tag another file from the remaining corpus.",
        "This process of semi-automatic tagging is continued for several iterations.",
        "This way we have developed a named entity annotated database of 72,157 words, including 6,268 named entities (1,852 place names, 3,201 person names and 1,215 organization names).",
        "There are ambiguities.",
        "For example, \"ko:Tla\" is a person first name in \"ko:Tla vijaybha:skar\" and it is also a common word that exists in a phrase such as \"padi ko:Tla rupa:yalu\" (10 crore rupees).",
        "There also exists ambiguity between a person entity and place entity.",
        "For example, \"siMha:calaM\" and \"raMga:reDDi\" are both person names as well as place names.",
        "There are also some problems while matching prefixes and suffixes of named entities.",
        "For example \"na:Du\" is a useful suffix for matching place names and the same suffix occurs with time entities such as \"so:mava:raMna:Du\".",
        "Prefixes like \"ra:j\" can be used for identifying person entities such as \"ra:jkiran\", \"ra:jgo:pa:l\",\"ra:js'e:khar\" etc.",
        "but the same prefix also occurs with common words like \"ra:jaki:ya:lu\".",
        "Thus these heuristics are not fool proof.",
        "We give below the results of our experiments using our heuristic based NER system for Telugu.",
        "Here, we have presented the performance of the heuristic-based NER system over two test data sets (AP-1 and AP-2).",
        "These test data sets are from the AP corpus.",
        "Total number ofwords (NoW) and number of named entities in the test data sets AP-1 and AP-2 are given in Table-3.",
        "Performance of the system is measured in terms of F-measure.",
        "The recognized named entity must be of the correct type (person, place or organization) for it to be counted as correct.",
        "A confusion matrix is also given.",
