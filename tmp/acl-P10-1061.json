        "The field of NLP has seen a recent surge in the amount of research on subjectivity analysis.",
        "Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, there have been efforts made to extend the resources and tools created for the English language to other languages.",
        "These endeavors have been successful in constructing lexicons, annotated corpora, and tools for subjectivity analysis in multiple languages.",
        "There are multilingual subjectivity analysis systems available that have been built to monitor and analyze various concerns and opinions on the Internet; among the better known are OASYS from the University of Maryland that analyzes opinions on topics from news article searches in multiple languages (Cesarano et al., 2007) and TextMap, an entity search engine developed by Stony Brook University for sentiment analysis along with other functionalities (Bautin et al., 2008).",

        "Given sentiment analysis systems in different languages, there are many situations when the analysis outcomes need to be multilanguage-comparable.",
        "For example, it has been common these days for the Internet users across the world to share their views and opinions on various topics including music, books, movies, and global affairs and incidents, and also multinational companies such as Apple and Samsung need to analyze customer feedbacks for their products and services from many countries in different languages.",
        "Governments may also be interested in monitoring terrorist web forums or its global reputation.",
        "Surveying these opinions and sentiments in various languages involves merging the analysis outcomes into a single database, thereby objectively comparing the result across languages.",
        "If there exists an ideal subjectivity analysis system for each language, evaluating the multilanguage-comparability would be unnecessary because the analysis in each language would correctly identify the exact meanings of all input texts regardless of the language.",
        "However, this requirement is not fulfilled with current technology, thus the need for defining and measuring the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis systems is evident.",

        "Much research have been put into developing methods for multilingual subjectivity analysis recently.",
        "With the high availability of subjectivity resources and tools in English, an easy and straightforward approach would be to employ a machine translation (MT) system to translate input texts in target languages into English then carry out the analyses using an existing subjectivity analysis tool (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Bautin et al., 2008;",
        "Banea et al.",

      "text": [
        "The quality of a subjectivity analysis tool is measured by its ability to distinguish subjectivity from objectivity and/or positive sentiments from negative sentiments.",
        "Additionally, a multilingual subjectivity analysis system is required to generate unbiased analysis results across languages; the system should base its outcome solely on the subjective meanings of input texts irrespective of the language, and the equalities and inequalities of subjectivity labels and intensities must be useful within and throughout the languages.",
        "Let us consider two cases where the pairs of multilingual inputs in English and Korean have identical and different subjectivity meanings (Figure 1).",
        "The first pair of texts carry a negative sentiment about how the release of a new electronics device might affect an emerging business market.",
        "When a multilanguage-comparable system is inputted with such a pair, its output should appropriately reflect the negative sentiment, and be identical for both texts.",
        "The second pair of texts share a similar positive sentiment about a mobile device's battery capacity but with different strengths.",
        "A good multilingual system must be able to identify the positive sentiments and distinguish the differences in their intensities.",
        "However, these kinds of conditions cannot be measured with performance evaluations independently carried out on each language; A system with a dissimilar ability to analyze subjective expressions from one language to another may deliver opposite labels or biased scores on texts with an identical subjective meaning, and vice versa, but still might produce similar performances on the evaluation data.",
        "Macro evaluations on individual languages cannot provide any conclusions on the system's multilanguage-comparability capability.",
        "To measure how much of a system's judgment principles are preserved across languages, an evaluation from a different perspective is necessary.",
        "An evaluation of multilanguage-comparability may be done in two ways: measuring agreements in the outcomes of a pair of multilingual texts with an identical subjective meaning, or measuring the consistencies in the label and/or accordance in the order of intensity of a pair of texts with different subjectivities.",
        "There are advantages and disadvantages to each approaches.",
        "The first approach requires multilingual texts aligned at the level of specificity, for instance, document, sentence and phrase, that the subjectivity analysis system works.",
        "Text corpora for MT evaluation such as newspapers, books, technical manuals, and government official records provide a wide variety of parallel texts, typically at the sentence level.",
        "Annotating these types of corpus can be efficient; as parallel texts must have identical semantic meanings, subjectivity-related annotations for one language can be projected into other languages without much loss of accuracy.",
        "The latter approach accepts any pair of multilingual texts as long as they are annotated with labels and/or intensity.",
        "In this case, evaluating the label consistency of a multilingual system is only as difficult as evaluating that of a monolingual system; we can produce all possible pairs of texts from test corpora annotated with labels for each language.",
        "Evaluating with intensity is not easy for the latter approach; if test corpora already exist with intensity annotations for both languages, normalizing the intensity scores to a comparable scale is necessary (yet is uncertain unless every pair is checked manually), otherwise every pair of multilingual texts needs a manual annotation with its relative order of intensity.",
        "In this paper, we utilize the first approach because it provides a more rational means; we can reasonably hypothesize that text translated into another language by a skilled translator carries an identical semantic meaning and thereby conveys identical subjectivity.",
        "Therefore the required resource is more easily attained in relatively inexpensive ways.",
        "For evaluation, we measure the consistency in the subjectivity labels and the correlation of subjectivity intensity scores of parallel texts.",

        "Riloff and Wiebe (2003) constructed a high-precision classifier for contiguous sentences using the number of strong and weak subjective words in current and nearby sentences.",
        "Unlike previous work, we do not (or rather, cannot) maintain assumptions about the proximity of input text.",
        "Using the lexicon, we build a simple and high-coverage rule-based subjectivity classifier.",

        "Which approach is most suitable for multilingual subjectivity analysis?",
        "In our experiments, the corpus-based systems trained on corpora translated from English to the target languages (T-CB) perform well for subjectivity classification and multilanguage-comparability measures on the whole.",
        "However, the methods we employed to expand the languages were naively carried out without much considerations for optimization.",
        "Further adjustments could improve the other systems for both classification and multilanguage-comparability performances.",
        "Is there a correlation between classification performance and multilanguage-comparability?",
        "Lexicon-based systems in the source language (S-LB) have good overall classification performances, especially on recall and F-measures.",
        "However, these systems performs worse on multilanguage-comparability than other systems with poorer classification performances.",
        "Intrigued by the observation, we tried to measure which criteria for classification performance influences multilanguage-comparability.",
        "We again employed",
        "Pearson's correlation metrics to measure the correlations of precision (P), recall (R), and F-measures (F) to kappa (k) and Pearson's correlation (p) values.",
        "Specifically, we measure the correlations between the sums of P, the sums of R, and the sums of F to k and p for all pairs of systems.The correlations of P with k and p are 0.78 and 0.68, R – 0.38 and – 0.28, and F – 0.20 and – 0.05.",
        "These numbers strongly suggest that multilanguage-comparability correlates with the precisions of classifiers.",
        "However, we cannot always expect a high-precision multilingual subjectivity classifier to be multilanguage-comparable as well.",
        "For example, the SSA system has a much higher precision than S-LB consistently over all languages, but their multilanguage-comparability performances differed only by small amounts."

        "Multilanguage-comparability is an analysis system's ability to retain its decision criteria across different languages.",
        "We implemented a number of previously proposed approaches to learning multilingual subjectivity, and evaluated the systems on multilanguage-comparability as well as classification performance.",
        "Our experimental results provide meaningful comparisons of the multilingual subjectivity analysis systems across various aspects.",
        "Also, we developed a multilingual subjectivity evaluation corpus from a parallel text, and studied inter-annotator, inter-language agreements on subjectivity, and observed persistent subjectivity projections from one language to another from a parallel text.",
        "For future work, we aim extend this work to constructing a multilingual sentiment analysis system and evaluate it with multilingual datasets such as product reviews collected from different countries.",
        "We also plan to resolve the lexicon-based classifiers' classification bias towards subjective meanings with a list of objective words (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and their multilingual expansion (Kim et al., 2009), and evaluate the multilanguage-comparability of systems constructed with resources from different sources.",
