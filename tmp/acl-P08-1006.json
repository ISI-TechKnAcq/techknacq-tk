        "Parsing technologies have improved considerably in the past few years, and high-performance syntactic parsers are no longer limited to PCFG-based frameworks (Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007), but also include dependency parsers (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) and deep parsers (Kaplan et al., 2004; Clark and Curran, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008).",
        "However, efforts to perform extensive comparisons of syntactic parsers based on different frameworks have been limited.",
        "The most popular method for parser comparison involves the direct measurement of the parser output accuracy in terms of metrics such as bracketing precision and recall, or dependency accuracy.",
        "This assumes the existence of a gold-standard test corpus, such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "It is difficult to apply this method to compare parsers based on different frameworks, because parse representations are often framework-specific and differ from parser to parser (Ringger et al., 2004).",
        "The lack of such comparisons is a serious obstacle for NLP researchers in choosing an appropriate parser for their purposes.",
        "In this paper, we present a comparative evaluation of syntactic parsers and their output representations based on different frameworks: dependency parsing, phrase structure parsing, and deep parsing.",
        "Our approach to parser evaluation is to measure accuracy improvement in the task of identifying protein-protein interaction (PPI) information in biomedical papers, by incorporating the output of different parsers as statistical features in a machine learning classifier (Yakushiji et al., 2005; Katrenko and Adriaans, 2006; Erkan et al., 2007; Saetre et al., 2007).",
        "PPI identification is a reasonable task for parser evaluation, because it is a typical information extraction (IE) application, and because recent studies have shown the effectiveness ofsyntactic parsing in this task.",
        "Since our evaluation method is applicable to any parser output, and is grounded in a real application, it allows for a fair comparison of syntactic parsers based on different frameworks.",
        "Parser evaluation in PPI extraction also illuminates domain portability.",
        "Most state-of-the-art parsers for English were trained with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank, and high accuracy has been reported for WSJ text; however, these parsers rely on lexical information to attain high accuracy, and it has been criticized that these parsers may overfit to WSJ text (Gildea, 2001;",
        "Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Another issue for discussion is the portability of training methods.",
        "When training data in the target domain is available, as is the case with the GENIA Treebank (Kim et al., 2003) for biomedical papers, a parser can be retrained to adapt to the target domain, and larger accuracy improvements are expected, if the training method is sufficiently general.",

        "The experimental results also demonstrate that PTB is significantly worse than the other representations with respect to cost for training/testing and contributions to accuracy improvements.",

        "The results for ENJU-CoNLL and ENJU-PAS show that PAS contributes to a larger accuracy improvement, although this does not necessarily mean the superiority ofPAS, because two imperfect conversions, i.e., PAS-to-PTB and PTB-to-CoNLL, are applied for creating CoNLL.",

        "Effectiveness of the parser ensemble is also attested by the fact that it resulted in larger improvements.",

        "Though the evaluation of syntactic parsers has been a major concern in the parsing community, and a couple of works have recently presented the comparison of parsers based on different frameworks, their methods were based on the comparison of the parsing accuracy in terms of a certain intermediate parse representation (Ringger et al., 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004; Briscoe and Carroll, 2006; Clark and Curran, 2007; Miyao et al., 2007; Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007b; Pyysalo et al., 2007a; Sagae et al., 2008).",

        "We have presented our attempts to evaluate syntactic parsers and their representations that are based on different frameworks; dependency parsing, phrase structure parsing, or deep parsing.",
        "The basic idea is to measure the accuracy improvements of the PPI extraction task by incorporating the parser output as statistical features of a machine learning classifier.",
        "Experiments showed that state-of-the-art parsers attain accuracy levels that are on par with each other, while parsing speed differs significantly.",
        "We also found that accuracy improvements vary when parsers are retrained with domain-specific data, indicating the importance of domain adaptation and the differences in the portability of parser training methods.",
        "Although we restricted ourselves to parsers trainable with Penn Treebank-style treebanks, our methodology can be applied to any English parsers.",
        "Candidates include RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, (Lin, 1998), and Link Parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993; Pyysalo et al., 2006), but the domain adaptation of these parsers is not straightforward.",
        "It is also possible to evaluate unsupervised parsers, which is attractive since evaluation of such parsers with goldstandard data is extremely problematic.",
        "A major drawback of our methodology is that the evaluation is indirect and the results depend on a selected task and its settings.",
        "This indicates that different results might be obtained with other tasks.",
        "Hence, we cannot conclude the superiority of parsers/representations only with our results.",
        "In order to obtain general ideas on parser performance, experiments on other tasks are indispensable."
