        "Developing non-trivial interactive spoken language applications currently requires significant effort, often several person-months.",
        "A major part of this effort is aimed at coping with variation in the spoken language input by users.",
        "One approach to handling variation is to write a large natural language grammar manually and hope that its coverage is sufficient for multiple applications (Dowding et al., 1994).",
        "Another approach is to create a simulation of the intended system (typically with a human in the loop) and then record users interacting with the simulation.",
        "The recordings are then transcribed and annotated with semantic information relating to the domain; the transcriptions and annotations can then be used to create a statistical understanding model (Miller et al., 1998) or used as guidance for manual grammar development (Aust et al., 1995).",
        "Building mixed initiative spoken language systems currently usually involves the design of semantic representations specific to the application domain.",
        "These representations are used to pass data between the language processing components: understanding, dialog, confirmation generation, and response generation.",
        "However, such representations tend to be domain-specific, and this makes it difficult to port to new domains or to use machine learning techniques without extensive hand-labeling of data with the semantic representations.",
        "Furthermore, the use of intermediate semantic representations still requires a final transduction step from the intermediate representation to the action format expected by the application back-end (e.g. SQL database query or procedure call).",
        "For situations when the effort and expertise available to build an application is small, the methods mentioned above are impractical, and highly directed dialog systems with little allowance for language variability are constructed.",
        "In this paper, we describe an approach to constructing interactive spoken language applications aimed at alleviating these problems.",
        "We first outline the characteristics of the method (section 2) and what needs to be provided by the application builder (section 3).",
        "In section 4 and section 5 we explain variant expansion and the operation of the system at runtime, and in section 6 we describe how confirmation requests are produced by the system.",
        "In section 7 we give some initial experimental results on varying the number of examples used to construct a call-routing application."

      "text": [
        "The goal of the approach discussed in this paper (which we refer to as \"variant transduction\") is to avoid the effort and specialized expertise used to build current research prototypes, while allowing more natural spoken input than is handled by spoken dialog systems built using current commercial practice.",
        "This led us to adopt the following constraints:",
        "• Applications are constructed using a relatively small number of example inputs (no grammar development or extensive data collection).",
        "• No intermediate semantic representations are needed.",
        "Instead, manipulations are performed on word strings and on action strings that are final (back-end) application calls.",
        "• Confirmation queries posed by the system to the user are constructed automatically from the examples, without the use of a separate generation component.",
        "• Dialog control should be simple to specify for simple applications, while allowing the flexibility of delegating this control to another module (e.g. an \"intelligent\" back-end agent) for more complex applications.",
        "We have constructed two telephone-based applications using this method, an application to access email and a call-routing application.",
        "These two applications were chosen to gain experience with the method because they have different usage characteristics and back-end complexity.",
        "For the email access system, usage is typically habitual, and the system's mapping of user utterances to back-end actions needs to take into account dynamic aspects of the current email session.",
        "For the call-routing application, the back-end calls executed by the system are relatively simple, but users may only encounter the system once, and the system's initial prompt is not intended to constrain the first input spoken by the user."

        "An interactive spoken language application constructed with the variant transduction method consists of a set of contexts.",
        "Each context provides the mapping between user inputs and application actions that are meaningful in a particular stage of interaction between the user and system.",
        "For example the email reader application includes contexts for logging in and for navigating a mail folder.",
        "The actual contexts that are used at runtime are created through a four step process: 1.",
        "The application developer specifies (a small number of) triples (e, a, c) where e is a natural language string (a typical user input), a is an application action (back-end application API call).",
        "For instance, the string read the message from John might be paired with the API call mailAgent.getWithSender(\"jsmith@att.com\").",
        "The third element of a triple, c, is an expression identifying another (or the same) context, specifically, the context the system will transition to if e is the closest match to the user's input.",

        "the dynamic aspects of a particular session.",

        "(For a small number of examples, a statistical N-gram model is ineffective because of low N-gram counts.)",
        "A detailed account of the recognition language model techniques used in the system is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "In the current implementation, actions are sequences of statements in the Java language.",
        "Constructors can be called to create new objects (e.g. a mail session object) which can be assigned to variables and referenced in other actions.",
        "The context interpreter loads the required classes and evaluates methods dynamically as needed.",
        "It is thus possible for an application developer to build a spoken interface to their target API without introducing any new Java classes.",
        "The system could easily be adapted to use action strings from other interpreted languages.",
