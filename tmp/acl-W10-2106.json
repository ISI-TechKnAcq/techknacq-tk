        "As in other languages, they can be used as part of the verbal complex (example (1-a)) or as adjectives (example (1-b)).",
        "Since German adjectives can generally undergo conversion into adverbs, participles can also be used adverbially (example (1-c)).",

        "In order to account for sentences like (1-c), an intuitive approach would be to generally allow for adverb conversion of participles in the grammar.",
        "However, on the basis of the German LFG grammar (Rohrer and Forst, 2006), we show that such a rule can have a strong negative on the overall performance of the parsing system, despite the fact that it produces the desired syntactic and semantic analysis for specific sentences.",
        "This trade-off between large-scale, statistical and theoretically precise coverage is often encountered in engineering broad-coverage and, at the same time, linguistically motivated parsing systems: adding the analysis for a specific phenomenon does not necessarily improve the overall quality of the system since the rule might overgenerate and interact with completely different phenomena in unpredicted ways.",
        "In principle, there are two ways of dealing with such an overgeneration problem in a grammar-based framework: First, one could hand-craft word lists or other linguistic constraints that restrict the adverb conversion to a certain set of participles.",
        "Second, one could try to mine corpora for this particular type of adverbs and integrate this automatically induced knowledge into the grammar (i.e. by means of pre-tagged input, word lists, etc.).",
        "In the case of adverbial participles, both ways are prone with difficulties.",
        "To our knowledge, there has not been much theoretical work on the linguistic properties of the participle adverb conversion.",
        "Moreover, since the distinction between (predicative) adjectives and adverbs is theoretically hard to establish, the standard tag set for German and, in consequence, annotated corpora for German do not explicitly capture this phenomenon.",
        "Thus, available statistical taggers and parsers for German usually conflate the syntactic structures underlying (1-b) and (1-c).",

        "We describe the ingretation of the automatically induced resource of adverbial participles into the German LFG, and provide a detailed evaluation of its effect on the grammar, see Section 5.",
        "While the use of parallel resources is rather familiar in a wide range of NLP domains, such as statistical machine translation (Koehn, 2005) or annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001), our work shows that they can be exploited for very specific problems that arise in deep linguistic analysis (see Section 4).",

        "The morphosyntactic ambiguity of German participles presents a notorious difficulty for theoretical and computational analysis.",
        "The reason is that adjectives (i.e. adjectival participles) do not only occur as attributive modifiers (shown in (1-a)), but can also be used as predicatives (see (2-b)).",
        "These predicatives have exactly the same form as verbal or adverbial participles (compare the three sentences in (2)).",
        "Predicatives do appear either as arguments of verbs like seem or as free adjuncts such that they are not even syntactically distinguishable from adverbs.",

        "Especially in the case of modifiers refering to a psychological state, the two underlying readings are hard to tell apart (Geuder, 2004).",
        "It is due to the lack of reliable semantic tests that the standard German tag set (Schiller et al., 1995) assigns the tag \"ADJD\" to predicative adjectives as well as adverbs.",

        "In the following, we will thus limit the discussion to adverbial participles and ignore the complexities related to predicative participles.",
        "In the German LFG, the treatment of a given participle form is closely tight to the morphological analysis encoded in DMOR.",
        "In particular, adverbial participles can have different degrees of lexicalisation.",
        "For bestimmt (probably) in (3-a), which is completely lexicalised, the morphology proposes two analyses: (i) a participle tag of the verbal lemma bestimmen (determine) and (ii) an adverb tag for the lemma bestimmt.",
        "In this case, the LFG parsing algorithm will figure out which morphological analysis yields a syntactically well-formed analysis.",
        "For gezielt (purposeful) in (3-b), DMOR outputs, besides the participle analysis, an adjective tag for the lemma.",
        "However, the grammar can turn it into an adverb by a general adverb conversion rule for adjectives.",
        "The difficult case for the German LFG grammar is illustrated in (3-c) by means of the adverbial participle wiederholt (repeatedly).",
        "This participle is neither lexi-calised as an adverb nor as an adjective, but it still can be used as an adverb.",

        "3.2 Assessing the Effect of Participle Ambiguity on the German LFG",
        "In this section, we want to illustrate the effect of one specific grammar rule, i.e. the rule that generally allows for conversion of participles into adverbs.",
        "We perform a contrastive evaluation of two versions of the grammar: (i) the No-Part-Adv version which does not allow for adverb conversion (except for the lexicalised participles from DMOR), (ii) the All-Part-Adv version which allows every participle to be analysed as adverb.",
        "Otherwise, the two versions of the grammar are completely identical.",
        "The comparison between the All-Part-Adv and No-Part-Adv grammar version pursues two major goals: On the one hand, we want to assess their overall quantitative performance on representative gold standard data, as it is common practice for statistical parsing systems.",
        "On the other hand, we are interested in getting a detailed picture of the quality of the grammar for parsing adverbial participles.",
        "These two goals do not necessarily go together since we know that the phenomenon is not very frequent in the data which we use for evaluation.",
        "Therefore, we do not only report accuracy on gold standard data in the following, but also focus on error analysis and describe ways of qualti-tatively assessing the grammar performance.",
        "For evaluation, we use the TIGER treebank (Brants et al., 2002).",
        "We report grammar performance on the development set which consists of the first 5000 TIGER sentences, and statistical accuracy on the standard heldout set which comprises 371 sentences.",
        "Quantitative Evaluation We first want to assess the quantitative impact of the phenomenon of adverbial participles in our evaluation data.",
        "We parse the heldout set storing all possible analyses obtained by both grammars, in order to compare the upperbound score that the both versions can optimally achieve (i.e. independently of the disambiguation quality).",
        "Then, we run the XLE evaluation in the \"oracle\" mode which means that the disambiguation compares all system analyses for a given sentence to its gold analysis, and chooses the best system analysis for computing accuracy.",
        "The upperbound f-score for both grammar versions is almost identical (at about 83.6%).",
        "This suggests that the phenomenon of adverbial participles does not occur in the heldout set.",
        "If we run the grammar versions on a larger set of sentences, the difference in coverage becomes more obvious.",
        "In Table 1, we report the absolute number of parsed sentences, starred sentences (only receiving a partial or fragment parse), and the timeouts on our standard TIGER development set.",
        "Not very surprisingly, the coverage of the All-Part-Adv version seems to be broader.",
        "However, this does not necessarily mean that the 40 additionally covered sentences all exhibit adverbial participles (see below).",
        "Moreover, Table 2 gives a first indication of the fact that the extended coverage comes at a price: the All-Part-Adv version massively increases the number of ambiguities per sentence.",
        "Related to this, in the All-PartAdv version, the number of timeouts increases by 16% and parsing speed goes down by 6% compared to the No-Part-Adv version.",
        "To assess the effect of the massively increased ambiguity rate and the bigger proportion of timeouts in All-Part-Adv, we perform a statistical evaluation of the two versions of the grammar against the heldout set, i.e. we compute f-score based nomenon (mostly related to coordination), but obtains an (incorrect) analysis on the basis ofthe adverb conversion rule.",
        "As an example, Figure 1 presents two c-structure analyses for the sentence in (4) in the All-Part-Adv grammar.",
        "In the second c-structure (CS2), the participle kritisiert (criticised) is analysed as adverb modifing the main verb haben (have).",

        "The Greens have the SPD criticised.",
        "\"The Greens have criticised the SPD\"",
        "This section has illustrated an exemplary dilemma for parsing systems that aim broad-coverage and linguisitically motivated analyses at the same time.",
        "Since these systems need to explicitly address and represent ambiguities that purely statistical systems are able to conflate or ignore, their performance is not automatically improved by adding a specific rule for a specific phenomenon.",
        "Interestingly, the negative consequences affecting the quantitative (statistical) as well as the qualitative (linguistic) dimension of the grammar seem to be closely related: The overgenerating adverb conversion rule empirically leads to linguistically unmotivated analyses which causes problems for the disambiguation component.",

        "Since we want to limit our investigation to those participles that are not already recorded as lexi-calised adjective or adverb in the DMOR morphology, we first have to generate the set of participle candidates from the tagged Europarl data.",

        "Throughout the entire set of annotated sentences, this ratio between the parallel cases (where an English adverbial correctly indicates a German adverbial) and all adverbially translated participles is at about 30%.",
        "This means that if we base the induction on word-alignments alone, its precision would be relatively low.",

        "This means that we have to rigorously filter the data that we extract on the basis of word-alignments in order to obtain a high quality resource for our grammar.",
        "In this section, we will investigate several filtering methods and evaluate them on our annotated sentence pairs.",
        "Frequency-based filtering As a first attempt, we filtered the non-parallel cases in our set of participle-adverb translations by means of the relative frequency of the adverb translations.",
        "For each participle candidate, we counted the number of tokens that exhibit an adverbial alignment on the English side, and divided this number by its total number of occurrences in the German Eu-roparl.",
        "The best f-score of the ADV-FREQ filter (see Table 4) is achieved by the 0.05 threshold, but generally, the precision of the frequency filters is too low for high-quality resource induction.",
        "The reason for the poor performance of the frequency-based filters seems to be that some German verbs are systematically translated as verb - adverb combinations as in (6).",
        "For these participles, the relative frequency of adverbial alignments is not a good indicator for their adverbial use in German.",
        "Multilingual Filtering Similar to filters used in annotation projection where noisy word-alignments are \"cleaned\" with the help of additional languages (Bouma et al., 2008), we have implemented a filter that only selects those participles as adverbials which also exhibit a certain amount ofadverbial translations in the French and Dutch Europarl.",
        "We count the total number of adverbial translations of a given participle on the French side and divide it by the number ofEnglish adverbial translations.",

        "For Dutch, the best f-score is achieved at a threshold of >0.05 (filter NL).",
        "The exact precision and recall values are given in Table 4.",
        "Syntax-based Filtering The intuition behind the filters presented in this section is that adverbial translations which are due to cross-lingual divergences can be identified on the basis of their syntactic contexts.",
        "Information about these contexts can be extracted from the dependency analyses produced by MaltParser for the German and English data.",
        "On the German side, we want to exclude those participle instances for which the German parser has found an auxiliary head, since this configuration points to a normal partciple context in German.",
        "The filter is called G-HEAD in Table 4.",
        "It filters all types which have an auxiliary head in more than 40% of their adverbial translation configurations.",
        "On the English side, we exclude all translations where the adverb has a verbal head which is also aligned to the German partciple.",
        "The filter is called E-HEAD in Table 4.",
        "It excludes all participle types which exhibit the E-HEAD configuration in more than 50% of the cases.",
        "Combined Token-level Filtering So far, we have shown that multilingual and syntactic information is useful to filter non-parallel participle translations.",
        "We have found that the precision of the syntactic filters can still be increased by combining it with the multilingual filters.",
        "COMBINED-1 in Table 4 refers to the filter which only includes those participle types which have at least one adverbial translation on the English target side such that (i) the adverbial translation is paralleled on the French or Dutch target side for the same German participle token and (ii) the German participle token does not have an auxiliary head.",
        "If we combine this token-level filtering with the syntactic type-level filtering G-HEAD and E-HEAD (the filter called COMBINED-2 in Table 4), the precision increases by about 25% with little loss in recall.",
        "Based on the filtering techniques described in the previous section, we can finally induce a list of 46 German adverbial participles from Europarl.",
        "The fact that this participle class seems fairly delimited in our data raises the theoretical question whether the adverb conversion is licensed by any linguistic, i.e. lexical-semantic, properties of these participles.",
        "However, we observe that the automatically induced list comprises very diverse types of adverbs, as well as very distinct types of underlying verbs.",

        "By explicitly enumerating the participles in the adverb lexicon, the grammar can apply the standard adverb macros to them.",
        "To assess the effect of the filtering, we built two new versions of the grammar: (i) Euro-Part-Adv, its adverb lexicon comprises all adverbially translated participles found in Europarl (1091 types) and (ii) Filt-Part-Adv, its adverb lexicon comprises only the syntactically and multilingually filtered participles found in Europarl (46 types).",
        "Although we have seen in section 3.2 that adverbial participles do not seem to occur in the TIGER heldout set, we also know that it is important to assess the effect of ambiguity rate on the overall grammar performance.",
        "Therefore, we computed the accuracy of the most probable parses produced by the Euro-Part-Adv and Filt-Part-Adv on the heldout set.",
        "As is shown in Table 5, the Euro-PartAdv performs significantly worse than Filt-Part-Adv.",
        "This suggests that the non-filtered participle resource is not constrained enough and still produces a lot of spurious ambiguites that mislead the disambiguation component.",
        "The coverage values in Table 6 further corroborate the observation that the unfiltered participle resource behaves similar to the unrestricted adverb conversion in All-PartAdv (see Section 3.2).",
        "The coverage of the filtered vs. the unfiltered version on the development set is identical, however the timeouts in Euro-Part-Adv increase by 17% and parsing time by 8%.",
        "By contrast, there is no significant difference in f-score between the No-Part-Adv version presented in Section 3.2 and the Filt-Part-Adv version.",
        "Thus, we can, at least, assume that the filtered participles resources has restricted the massive overgeneration caused by the general adverb conversion rule such that the overall performance of the original grammar is not negatively affected.",
        "To evaluate the participle resource as to whether it could have a positive qualtitative effect on parsing TIGER at all, we built a specialised testsuite which comprises only sentences containing a non-lexicalised participle, which has an adverbial translation in Europarl and is tagged as ADJD",
