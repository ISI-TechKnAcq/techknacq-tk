        "It is well known that a sentence in Chinese (or several other oriental languages) consists of a continuous string of 'characters' without delimiting white spaces to identify words.",
        "In Chinese, the characters are called ideographs.",
        "This makes it difficult to do machine studies on these languages since isolated words are needed for many purposes, such as linguistic analysis, machine translation, etc.",
        "Automatic methods for correctly isolating words in a sentence -- a process called word segmentation -- is therefore an important and necessary first step to be taken before other analysis can begin.",
        "Many researchers have proposed practical methods to resolve this problem such as (Nie et al., 1995, Wu and Tsang, 1995, Jin & Chen, 1996, Ponte & Croft, 1996, Sproat et al., 1996, Sun et al., 1997).",
        "Information retrieval (IR) deals with the problem of selecting relevant documents for a user need that is expressed in free text.",
        "The document collection is usually huge, of gigabyte size, and both queries and documents are domain unrestricted and unpredictable.",
        "When one does IR in the Chinese language with its peculiar property, then one would assume that accurate word segmentation is also a crucial first step before other processing can begin.",
        "However, in the recent 5th Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-5) where a fairly large scale Chinese IR experiment was performed [Kwok and Grunfeld, 199x], we have demonstrated that a simple word segmentation method, couple with a powerful retrieval algorithm, is sufficient to provide quite good retrieval results.",
        "Moreover, experiments by others using even simpler bigram representation of text (i.e. all consecutive overlapping two characters), both within and outside the TREC environment, also produce good results [Ballerini et al., 199x, Buckley et al., 199x, Chien, 1995, Liang et al., 1996].",
        "This is a bit counter-intuitive because the bigram method leads to three times as large an indexing feature space compared with our segmentation (approximately 1.5 million vs 05 million), and one would expect that there are many random, non-content matchings between queries and documents that may adversely affect precision.",
        "Apparently, this is not so.",
        "Based on this observation, we made some adjustments to our lexicon, and provide some experimental results of the lexicon effects on retrieval effectiveness."

        "While word segmentation for linguistic analysis may aim at the longest string that carry a specific semantic content, this may not be ideal for IR because one then has to deal with the problem of partial string matching when a query term matches only part of a document term or vice versa.",
        "Instead, we aim at segmenting texts into short words of one to three characters long that function like English content terms.",
        "Our process is based on the following four steps A to D: A) facts - lookup on a manually created 2175-entry lexicon called LO.",
        "This is small, consisting of commonly used words of 1 to 3 characters, with some proper nouns of size 4.",
        "Each entry is tagged as 0 (useful: total 1337), 1 (stopword: 671), s (symbol: 88), 6 (numeric: 37), 4 (punctuation: 9), and 2 or 3 for the rules below.",
        "Other researchers have used lexicons of hundreds of thousands.",
        "We do not have such a large resource; besides, maintenance of such a list is not trivial.",

        "We attempt to identify some common language usage ad-hoc rules that can be employed to further split the chunks into short words.",
        "The rules that we use, together with their rationale and examples and counterexamples are described below: Rule D (for double): any two adjacent similar characters xx are considered stopwords -- this identifies double same characters that are often used as adjectives or adverbs that do not carry much content (see ex.",
        "1-3 below).",
        "However, some Chinese names do use double same characters (ex.4) and we would 'stop' them wrong.",

        "Congress' (ex.6) requires splitting between the same two characters.",

        "Rule E (for even): any remaining sequence of even number of characters are segmented two by two -- this arises from the observation that 70-80% of Chinese words are 2-characters long, and the rhythm of Chinese are often bi-syllable punctuated with monosyllables and tri-syllables.",
