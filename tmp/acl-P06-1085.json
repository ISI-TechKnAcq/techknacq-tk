        "It is also one of the key problems that human language learners must solve as they are learning language.",
        "Many previous methods for unsupervised word segmentation are based on the observation that transitions between units (characters, phonemes, or syllables) within words are generally more predictable than transitions across word boundaries.",
        "Statistics that have been proposed for measuring these differences include “successor frequency” (Harris, 1954), “transitional probabilities” (Saf-fran et al., 1996), mutual information (Sun et al., *This work was partially supported by the following grants: NIH 1R01-MH60922, NIH RO1-DC000314, NSF IGERT-DGE-9870676, and the DARPA CALO project.",

        "While methods based on local statistics are quite successful, here we focus on approaches based on explicit probabilistic models.",
        "Formulating an explicit probabilistic model permits us to cleanly separate assumptions about the input and properties of likely segmentations from details of algorithms used to find such solutions.",
        "Specifically, this paper demonstrates the importance of contextual dependencies for word segmentation by comparing two probabilistic models that differ only in that the first assumes that the probability of a word is independent of its local context, while the second incorporates bigram dependencies between adjacent words.",
        "The algorithms we use to search for likely segmentations do differ, but so long as the segmentations they produce are close to optimal we can be confident that any differences in the segmentations reflect differences in the probabilistic models, i.e., in the kinds of dependencies between words.",
