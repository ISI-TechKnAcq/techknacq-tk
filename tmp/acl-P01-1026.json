        "Reflecting the growth in utilization of the World Wide Web, a number of Web-based language processing methods have been proposed within the natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and artificial intelligence (AI) communities.",
        "A sample of these includes methods to extract linguistic resources (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000; Resnik, 1999; Soderland, 1997), retrieve useful information in response to user queries (Etzioni, 1997; McCallum et al., 1999) and mine/discover knowledge latent in the Web (Inokuchi et al., 1999).",
        "In this paper, mainly from an NLP point of view, we explore a method to produce linguistic resources.",
        "Specifically, we enhance the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), which extracts encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., term descriptions) from the Web.",
        "In brief, their method searches the Web for pages containing a term in question, and uses linguistic expressions and HTML layouts to extract fragments describing the term.",
        "They also use a language model to discard non-linguistic fragments.",
        "In addition, a clustering method is used to divide descriptions into a specific number of groups.",
        "On the one hand, their method is expected to enhance existing encyclopedias, where vocabulary size is relatively limited, and therefore the quantity problems has been resolved.",
        "On the other hand, encyclopedias extracted from the Web are not comparable with existing ones in terms of quality.",
        "In hand-crafted encyclopedias, term descriptions are carefully organized based on domains and word senses, which are especially effective for human usage.",
        "However, the output ofFujii’s method is simply a set of unorganized term descriptions.",
        "Although clustering is optionally performed, resultant clusters are not necessarily related to explicit criteria, such as word senses and domains.",
        "To sum up, our belief is that by combining extraction and organization methods, we can enhance both quantity and quality of Web-based encyclopedias.",
        "Motivated by this background, we introduce an organization model to Fujii’s method and reformalize the whole framework.",
        "In other words, our proposed method is not only extraction but generation of encyclopedic knowledge.",
        "Section 2 explains the overall design of our encyclopedia generation system, and Section 3 elaborates on our organization model.",
        "Section 4 then explores a method for applying our resultant encyclopedia to NLP research, specifically, question answering.",
        "Section 5 performs a number of experiments to evaluate our methods."

        "In Figure 1, terms can be submitted either on-line or off-line.",
        "A reasonable method is that while the system periodically updates the encyclopedia off-line, terms unindexed in the encyclopedia are dynamically processed in real-time usage.",
        "In either case, our system processes input terms one by one.",

        "Since the extraction module (see Section 2.3) analyzes the usage of the input term in retrieved pages, pages not containing the term are of no use for our purpose.",

        "In the extraction module, given Web pages containing an input term, newline codes, redundant white spaces and HTML tags that are not used in the following processes are discarded to standardize the page format.",
        "Second, we approximately identify a region describing the term in the page, for which two rules are used.",
        "The first rule is based on Japanese linguistic patterns typically used for term descriptions, such as “X toha Y dearu (X is Y).” Following the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), we semi-automatically produced 20 patterns based on the Japanese CD-ROM World Encyclopedia (Heibonsha, 1998), which includes approximately 80,000 entries related to various fields.",
        "It is expected that a region including the sentence that matched with one of those patterns can be a term description.",
        "The second rule is based on HTML layout.",
        "In a typical case, a term in question is highlighted as a heading with tags such as <DT>, <B> and <Hx> (“x” denotes a digit), followed by its description.",
        "In some cases, terms are marked with the anchor <A> tag, providing hyperlinks to pages where they are described.",
        "Finally, based on the region briefly identified by the above method, we extract a page fragment as a term description.",
        "Since term descriptions usually consist of a logical segment (such as a paragraph) rather than a single sentence, we extract a fragment that matched with one of the following patterns, which are sorted according to preference in descending order:",

        "For the moment, we assume that we know a priori which domains are related to the input term.",
        "From the viewpoint of probability theory, our task here is to select descriptions with greater probability for given domains.",
        "The probability for description d given domain c, P(d|c), is commonly transformed as in Equation (1), through use of the Bayesian theorem.",

        "Second, P(d), which is a product of probabilities for N-grams in d, is quite sensitive to the length of d. In the cases of machine translation and speech recognition, this problem is less crucial because multiple candidates compared based on the language model are almost equivalent in terms of length.",
        "However, since in our case length of descriptions are significantly different, shorter descriptions are more likely to be selected, regardless of the quality.",

        "Table 1 shows the result of our comparative experiment, in which “C” and “A” denote coverage and accuracy, respectively, for variations of our QA system.",
        "Since all the questions we used are quadruple-choice, in case the system cannot answer the question, random choice can be performed to improve the coverage to 100%.",
        "Thus, for each knowledge resource we compared cases without/with random choice, which are denoted “w/o Random” and “w/ Random” in Table 1, respectively.",
        "In the case where random choice was not performed, the Web-based encyclopedia noticeably improved the coverage for the Nichigai dictionary, but decreased the accuracy.",
        "However, by combining both resources, the accuracy was noticeably improved, and the coverage was comparable with that for the Nichigai dictionary.",
        "On the other hand, in the case where random choice was performed, the Nichigai dictionary and the Web-based encyclopedia were comparable in terms of both the coverage and accuracy.",
        "Additionally, by combining both resources, the accuracy was further improved.",
        "We also investigated the performance of our QA system where descriptions related to the computer domain are solely used.",
        "However, coverage/accuracy did not significantly change, because as shown in Figure 3, most of the descriptions were inherently related to the computer domain."

        "The World Wide Web has been an unprecedentedly enormous information source, from which a number of language processing methods have been explored to extract, retrieve and discover various types of information.",
        "In this paper, we aimed at generating encyclopedic knowledge, which is valuable for many applications including human usage and natural language understanding.",
        "For this purpose, we reformalized an existing Web-based extraction method, and proposed a new statistical organization model to improve the quality of extracted data.",
        "Given a term for which encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., descriptions) is to be generated, our method sequentially performs a) retrieval of Web pages containing the term, b) extraction of page fragments describing the term, and c) organizing extracted descriptions based on domains (and consequently word senses).",
        "In addition, we proposed a question answering system, which answers interrogative questions associated with what, by using a Web-based encyclopedia as a knowledge base.",
        "For the purpose of evaluation, we used as test inputs technical terms collected from the Class II IT engineers examination, and found that the encyclopedia generated through our method was of operational quality and quantity.",
        "We also used test questions from the Class II examination, and evaluated the Web-based encyclopedia in terms of question answering.",
        "We found that our Web-based encyclopedia improved the system coverage obtained solely with an existing dictionary.",
        "In addition, when we used both resources, the performance was further improved.",
        "Future work would include generating information associated with more complex interrogations, such as ones related to how and why, so as to enhance Web-based natural language understanding."
