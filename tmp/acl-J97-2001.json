        "Given a request to communicate, a language generator typically must select information from an underlying domain representation and determine how to order this information, ultimately realizing the representation as sentences by selecting words and linearly ordering them under the syntactic constraints of the language.",
        "The problem of determining what words to use for the concepts in the domain representation is termed lexical choice.",
        "In an effort to make domain representations independent of language, there may be a variety of different words that can be used to express any concept in the domain, and a language generator must choose which one is most appropriate in the current context.",
        "A one-to-one mapping between each domain concept and a word of the language would imply that concepts are represented by words, clearly an undesirable situation.",
        "Just as there is no reason to assume that a concept uniquely determines a word, there is no reason to assume that a single concept must map to a single word; a domain concept may be expressed by multiple words, or conversely, a single word may express a combination of concepts (Talmy 1985; Zock 1988).",
        "Avoiding encoding any assumptions about the mapping between domain and language has the benefit of portability; the architecture and some knowledge sources of the generator can be reused for a variety of different applications in quite different",
        "domains.",
        "However, it means the task of lexical choice is computationally complex, requiring consideration of a potentially large number of mappings between concepts and words.",
        "This is complicated by the fact that constraints on lexical choice come from a wide variety of sources:",
        "• Syntax (the choice of a particular verb influences the syntactic forms that can be used to realize its arguments, which in turn constrains the words used to lexicalize these arguments).",
        "For example, if the main verb to allow is selected, then the object must be either a clause (allow one to select) or a noun-group (allow the selection).1 • Semantics (the concept itself and how it is taxonomized in the domain influence which word should be used).",
        "For example, when discussing basketball, the words rebound and point realize distinct concepts under the generic concept of a player \"performance.\" • The lexicon (the choice of one word can constrain the choice of other words in a sentence).",
        "For example, the selection of rebound as object noun would entail preferring to grab over to score as main verb, while the selection of point would entail the opposite verb choice, since to grab rebounds and to score points are lexical collocations, whereas ?to score rebounds and ?to grab points are not.",
        "• The domain (the same words are used to refer to different concepts in different domain sublanguages).",
        "For example, rebound means different things in the basketball domain and in the stock-market domain (IBM rebounded from a 3 day loss vs. Magic grabbed 20 rebounds).",
        "• Pragmatics (information about speaker intent, hearer background, or previous discourse plays a role).",
        "This may lead to the decision to refer to the same situation as a glass half full or half empty.",
        "Furthermore, interaction between constraints is multidirectional, making it difficult to determine a systematic ordering in which constraints should be taken into account.",
        "In fact, earlier work on lexical choice (Danlos 1986) implied that a new ordering of constraints, and thus a new architecture for lexical choice, must be developed for each new domain.",
        "In this paper, we present a general approach to lexical choice that can handle multiple, interacting constraints.",
        "Our architecture positions the lexical choice module between a language generator's content planner and surface sentence generator, in order to take into account conceptual, pragmatic, and linguistic constraints on word choice.",
        "We show how the Functional Unification Formalism (FuF) (Elhadad 1993a), originally developed for representing syntactic grammars (Kay 1979), can be used to represent a generation lexicon, allowing for declarative and compositional representation of independent constraints.",
        "The order of constraint application is determined dynamically through unification, allowing for different orderings as required.",
        "Since any approach must deal with a combinatorial explosion of possible mappings and ordering of constraints, computational efficiency is in general an issue.",
        "We show control techniques we have developed within FUF to reduce overall search.",
        "In this paper,",
        "we illustrate our model for lexical choice as it has been implemented in ADVISOR-II (Elhadad 1993c), a system that can advise students about course selection, but we also draw on examples from two other systems based on the same model but within different generation architectures: STREAK, a system for generating basketball game summaries (Robin 1994a; Robin and McKeown 1996) and COOK (Smadja and McKeown 1991), a system that generates stock market reports.'",
        "We have used this same model for lexical choice in other systems we have developed, such as COMET (McKeown et al.",
        "1990), a multimedia explanation system for equipment maintenance and repair, and PLANDOC (Kukich et al.",
        "1994), an automated documentation system under collaborative development with Bellcore.",
        "We focus on the problem of floating constraints, constraints that cannot be mapped in a systematic way from an input conceptual representation to the linguistic structure.",
        "Instead, such constraints float, appearing at a variety of different levels in the resulting linguistic structure, depending on other constraints in the input.",
        "Such constraints pose problems (see discussion in Elhadad and Robin [1992]) for the top-down recursive building of the linguistic structure used by most generation algorithms (Meteer et al.",
        "1987; Shieber et al.",
        "1990); these algorithms typically only handle structural constraints, constraints that are consistently expressed at a given linguistic rank (e.g., the sentence, clause, group, or word rank) (Halliday 1985) in the application domain sublanguage.",
        "We consider two different types of floating constraints:",
        "• Interlexical constraints, which arise from restrictions on lexical co-occurrences such as collocations (Smadja 1991) (they are orthogonal to the mapping from input content units onto output linguistic form since they both originate from the lexicon and act upon the lexicon).",
        "• Cross-ranking constraints, which arise from the fact that an input network of content units is not isomorphic with the resulting linguistic structure, allowing a single content unit to be realized by surface elements of various linguistic ranks (cross-ranking proper), or multiple content units to be realized by the same surface element (merging).",
        "Sentences (1) and (2) below, generated by COOK, illustrate cross-ranking constraints.",
        "They show how time and manner can be mapped to two different surface elements of different syntactic rank in the sentence, among many other possibilities.",
        "Sentences (3) and (4), generated by STREAK, show how game result and manner can be realized as two separate surface elements or can be merged into a single element, the verb.",
        "(1) Wall Street Indexes opened strongly.",

        "(game result",
        "In these examples, the input conceptual constraints (time and manner) float, appearing at a variety of different syntactic ranks (here, verb and circumstantial), and are sometimes merged with other semantic constraints.",
        "Which content units are floating and which are structural depends on the domain and the particular target sublanguage.",
        "Our corpus analysis of the basketball domain, for example, indicates that historical knowledge is floating, whereas game result information is structural.",
        "Similarly, in the student advising domain, we found course evaluation (e.g., how difficult or interesting a course is) to be floating, whereas the description of the assignments required (e.g., how many there are or whether they involve writing essays, software, or proofs) in a course is structural.",
        "Floating constraints have not been addressed in a general way in previous work; most systems implicitly hardwire the choices or permit only one or two of many possibilities.",
        "In contrast, our model for lexical choice accommodates floating constraints, resulting in a system with a high degree of paraphrasing power.",
        "In the following sections, we first present our general model for lexical choice, illustrating it with a relatively simple example.",
        "We then discuss different types of constraints and the problems they pose, presenting the techniques we have developed within FUF to address these issues, turning from structural constraints, to pragmatic cross-ranking constraints, and to interlexical constraints.",

        "Generation systems perform two types of tasks: one conceptual, determining the content of the text to be generated, and one linguistic, determining the form of that text (McDonald 1983; McKeown 1985).",
        "Typically, a generator has two modules, each corresponding to one of these two tasks, a content planner and a linguistic realizer.",
        "While many systems allow for interaction across these components, there is general consensus that these two components can be separated (Reiter 1994).",
        "Furthermore, within the linguistic component, there appears to be further consensus that the task of syntactic realization can be isolated.",
        "As evidence, note that a number of dedicated syntactic realization components have been developed such as SURGE (Elhadad and Robin 1996), NIGEL (Matthiessen 1991), MUMBLE (Meteer et al.",
        "1987), and TAGs (Yang, McCoy, and Vijay-Shanker 1991; Harbusch 1994).",
        "Such components expect as input a specification of the thematic structure of the sentence to generate, with the syntactic category and open-class words of each thematic role.'",
        "Thematic structure involves roles such as agent, patient, instrument, etc.",
        "It is opposed to surface syntactic structure which involves roles such as subject, object, adjunct, etc.",
        "Due to general syntactic alternations (Levin 1993) such as passive, dative, it-extraposition, or clefting, the mapping from thematic roles onto surface syntactic roles is one-to-many.",
        "The role of the syntactic grammar is to (1) map the thematic structure onto a surface syntactic one, (2) enforce syntactic rules such as agreement, (3) choose the closed-class words, (4) inflect the open-class ones, and (5) linearize the surface syntactic tree into a natural language string.",
        "These tasks indicate the kind of information the syntactic grammar needs as input.",
        "For example, unless the system is to choose randomly, it needs enough information to choose between different syntactic options available in the grammar.",
        "Furthermore, input must either specify all words, or provide enough features so that the syntactic grammar can lexicalize any words that are syntactically determined.",
        "Lexical choice could be carried out at any number of places within this standard architecture.",
        "Figure 1 shows the typical language generation architecture used in many systems, indicating the different places for lexical choice to occur.",
        "One option would be to position lexical choice as part of syntactic realization, as just a very specific type of syntactic decision (i.e., option 3 in Figure 1).",
        "Researchers who work on reversible",
        "grammar formalisms, using the same grammar to both parse and generate language, take this approach (Van Noord 1990; Shieber and Shabes 1991; Strzalkowski 1994).",
        "The systemic grammar paradigm also takes this approach, where lexical choice is the most \"delicate\" of decisions, occurring as a by-product of many high-level syntactic choices.",
        "However, in computational implementations of the systemic paradigm, such as NIGEL (Mann and Matthiessen 1983), only the syntactic constraints on lexical choice are handled during syntactic realization.",
        "The semantic constraints on lexical choice are in effect taken into account in the input knowledge representation (i.e., option 1 in Figure 1).",
        "There are two problems with option 3 (during syntactic realization).",
        "First, the range of constraints on lexical choice covered in this line of work is quite restricted and we have some question about whether it could be extended to include the pragmatic constraints considered here.",
        "Furthermore, since words are selected only once the full syntactic tree is constructed, it would be quite difficult, if not impossible, to account for floating constraints.",
        "Such constraints cannot be considered solely from local positions within a constructed tree, but require some global knowledge of interaction between semantic units.",
        "If lexical choice is not part of the syntactic realization component, then all decisions regarding open-class word selection must be made before the grammar is invoked.'",
        "They then must occur either as part of content planning or after all content has been determined and expressed in a language-independent manner.",
        "While some researchers have directly associated words with each concept in the domain-knowledge base (e.g., Reiter 1991; Swartout 1983), this approach does not allow for consideration of syntactic and lexical constraints unless a phrasal lexicon is used (e.g., Kukich 1983b; Danlos 1986; Jacobs 1985; Hovy 1988).",
        "Using a phrasal lexicon, however, means hand-encoding the many mappings of multiple constraints onto multiword phrasings.",
        "It thus does not allow for compositional lexical representation (Pustejovsky and Boguraev 1993), and entails a combinatorial explosion in the number of entries to cover the variations of phrases that are possible in different contexts.",
        "This approach thus does not allow for scaling up paraphrasing power (see Robin and McKeown [1996] for a quantitative evaluation of the scalability gains resulting from the compositional word-based approach).",
        "By waiting until content planning is complete, lexical and syntactic constraints can be represented explicitly and independently of one another, instead of being embedded into full phrases, allowing for a more economical and flexible word-based lexicon that incorporates phrasal constraints.",
        "The only remaining option is to position the lexical choice module between the content planner and the syntactic realization module.",
        "Note that some high-level decisions about sentence structure must be made early on with this architecture (i.e., before syntactic realization), since, for example, selecting the verb imposes syntactic constraints on how its arguments can be realized.",
        "This is desirable since it allows a system to take into account only those syntactic constraints on lexical choice that are relevant.",
        "In fact, in the eight domains for which we have implemented generators, we have never found a case where other syntactic decisions made during realization force the lexical chooser to undo an earlier decision.",
        "This experience strongly supports modularization between lexical choice and syntactic realization.'",
        "As we will show, this architecture allows us to convey several aspects of the semantic content using the same word and at the same time, allows us to realize the same semantic concept at a variety of syntactic ranks depending on the situation.",
        "In particular, by selecting words before a syntactic tree has been constructed, the lexical syntactic features associated with alternate lexical choices can constrain the high-level structure of the final tree, which is a key feature to handling floating constraints."

        "For this example, we will restrict the available sites in the syntactic clause capable of realizing the evaluation to be: the main verb, modifiers of the NP realizing the class (i.e., premodifying adjective or relative clause), and the determiner sequence.\" The input description for this configuration of semantic units is shown in Figure 13 both graphically and as an FD matrix.",
        "In the graphical representation, argumentative evaluations are represented as wavy lines, and semantic predications as straight lines.",
        "The dotted line indicates that the two evaluations (many assignments and difficulty) are part of an argumentative rule – a topos – which reads: the more a class has assignments the more difficult it is.",
        "In the FD matrix, the evaluations and the conceptual relations are represented under two separate top-level features of the input semr (floating and structural respectively).",
        "This representation does not commit the Lexical Chooser to map the evaluations to any particular site a priori – highlighting the floating nature of evaluations.",
        "Therefore, one of the tasks of the Lexical Chooser, is to decide to which node in the linguistic tree the argumentative evaluations will be attached.",
        "In the overall flow of control followed by FUF (discussed in Section 2.5), semantic relations are mapped onto a linguistic tree, which is expanded top-down, breadth-first.",
        "So the decision to attach an evaluation at a given node in the linguistic structure must also be made top-down.",
        "This order of decision making is shown in Figure 14 and is followed as the clause structure is constructed.",
        "At each stage of this traversal, the Lexical Chooser checks whether there is lexical material available in the lexicon to realize the evaluation at the specified syntactic level.",

        "20 In the implementation of ADvisoR-II, the Lexical Chooser also considers as potential sites connectives and indirect argumentative evaluations – i.e., relying on a topos relation of the form \"the more a class has assignments, the more difficult it is,\" one can realize the evaluation of a class as difficult by evaluating as large the set of assignments it requires.",

        "Note that at this level of processing, the Lexical Chooser does not yet know whether appropriate lexical material will be found to satisfy the constraint of expressing the AO connotation.",
        "For example, when deciding to try branch 2, we still do not know whether an appropriate verb will be found.",

        "In this case, the AO constraint must be mapped down to an NP participant of the clause.",
        "The mapping inside the NPs is not described in the map-ao-clause alt, because, at this level, the Lexical Chooser has no knowledge of which NPs will be added to the syntactic structure.",

        "When a new NP constituent is constructed by the Lexical Chooser, the alt map-ao-np will perform a function similar to map-ao-clause but within the NP.",
        "At the clause level, the delegation is encoded using the feature: [ ao [ conveyed ANY ] ] The ANY feature is a powerful construct of FUF that imposes that a feature be instantiated at the end of the unification process.",
        "Because unification is order-independent, ANY constraints can only be checked after the entire grammar has been traversed at all the levels.",

        "1979), bk-class is specialized to the case of FUF.",

        "In our example, backtracking is triggered by the requirement that the value of the subattribute conveyed of the attribute ao be instantiated, when the actual subattribute is not.",
        "The path {AO conveyed} defines the address of the failure, i.e., the only decision points in the backtracking stack that could have caused the failure.",
        "Identifying the address of a failure requires additional control knowledge that must be declared in the FUG.",
        "More precisely, we allow the FUG writer to declare certain paths in the FUG to be of a certain bk-class.",
        "We then require the explicit declaration in the FUG of the choice points that correspond to this bk-class.",
        "In such cases, the writer must realize that the decisions within the class are interdependent, but she need not have knowledge of which one is most likely to succeed.",
        "For example, the statement: (define-bk-class AO conveyed) specifies that all paths ending with the attribute conveyed are of class AO.",
        "In addition, we tag in the FUF program all alts that have an influence on the handling of the AO constraint with a declaration ( :bk-class AO) as shown in Figures 15 and 16.",
        "To illustrate how bk-class helps in dealing with floating constraints, consider again the require example discussed in the previous subsection.",
        "In the lexicon fragment of Figure 15, costly backtracking is avoided by forcing a fixed order for the consideration of the possible sites to express the AO: first verb, then adverb, and finally argument NP.",

        "To overcome the limitation of this deterministic site selection for the AO attachment and allow a variety of possible outputs, we can force a random selection in the alt map-AO-clause of Figure 15.",
        "This is achieved by adding an ( :order :random) annotation to the alt map-AO-clause, which becomes: (def-alt map-ao-clause ( :bk-class AO) ( :order :random) ... ) With this annotation, FUF nondeterministically chooses one of the four branches of the disjunction.",
        "In this manner, the algorithm shown in Figure 14 is not performed in a fixed order.",
        "As a consequence, the Lexical Chooser can map the AO evaluation to a noun modifier, even though it was possible to merge it into the verb – producing either Al requires six assignments or Al, which is difficult, has seven assignments.",
        "In the Lexical Chooser of ADVISOR-IT, the AO mapping mechanism also interacts with the phrase planning component and maps the AO to a dedicated evaluative clause – producing in our example the complex clause Al has seven assignments; therefore it is difficult.",

        "The dependency-directed mechanism implemented in FUF with bk-class therefore complements a general top-down control regime to make the processing of floating constraints efficient.",
        "The performance penalty imposed by a floating constraint depends on the number of sites in the syntactic structure where it can be realized.",
        "For example, the AO constraint can be realized at three levels and it may require the unifier to retraverse the same FUG branches three times until it finds a site to convey the AO constraint.",

        "The bk-class mechanism improves the efficiency of functional unification while preserving its desirable properties – declarativeness and bidirectional constraint satisfaction.",

        "Using bk-class, however, is not always easy for the FUG writer since it requires thinking about the control strategy of the unifier – the same drawback as for PRoLoG's cut mechanism.",

        "The collocational constraints between verb and noun are represented with the noun in this scheme.",
        "In this case, modularity in the representation of individual constraints is preserved.",
        "Semantic constraints on the respective lexicalizations of the predicate and its argument are independently encoded.",
        "However, the orthogonal interlexical constraint can trigger backtracking: for example, if the verb to break is first randomly chosen for the relation improve and then the noun high gets selected because the input indicates the player as the reference set for the maximum concept, the Lexical Chooser must backtrack to select the verb post instead.",
        "Test input for the sentence John Stockton posted a high with 45 points.",
        "In order to both preserve modularity and avoid backtracking, the solution is to delay the choice of one collocate until the other one is chosen.",
        "We have implemented this in FUF through a control mechanism termed : wait, which allows explicit representation of the interlexical constraints along with modular representation of the individual semantic constraints on word choice.",
        "The : wait mechanism is used to indicate that a particular choice should be delayed until some other specific choice point in the grammar.",
        "Again, the grammar writer must know that the two decisions are interdependent, but does not need to know which one will take priority.",
        "Here, the choice of verb is delayed until the head of the object is selected.",
        "Figure 19 shows how the : wait annotation of FUF implements such a delay.",
        "In this case, the choice of verb is suspended until its object noun collocates have been chosen.",
        "Therefore, no backtracking occurs even though the respective semantic constraints on the lexicalization of the predicate and its argument are kept separate.",
        "The : wait annotation is a general control facility that allows optimizing a FUG whenever it is known that two decision classes are dependent on one another.",
        "The case illustrated in this paper, where these two decisions classes are verb choice and object head noun choice, is only one of the many types of optimizations made possible by the use of : wait (see Elhadad [1993c] for other types)."

        "1989) and PLANDOC (McKeown, Robin, and Kulcich 1995).",
        "These systems are more limited, however, in that they do not handle floating constraints, and thus lexical choice consists of a one-to-one mapping between conceptual and linguistic structures.",
        "This mapping focuses on the paradigmatic decisions and can be efficiently performed using the simple default top-down regime of recursive unification.",
        "But in effect, this shifts the burden of performing most syntagmatic decisions to the Content Planner, which must then hand to the Lexical Chooser a tree-structured input that already prefigures the (lexicalized) thematic tree that the Lexical Chooser in turn passes on to SURGE.",
        "In COMET, a system which generates multimedia explanations for equipment maintenance and repair, the major research focus is the coordination of multiple media and some word choices are influenced by decisions made by the graphics component.",
        "For example, to determine how to refer to an object in an accompanying illustration, the Lexical Chooser takes into account how the object is depicted (McKeown et al.",
        "1992).",
        "COMET also considers constraints from the user and from previous discourse in selecting words.",
        "This case has some similarities with floating constraints; if a word is unknown to the user, an alternative word that can simply be substituted in the sentence may not exist.",
        "Instead, COMET must replan the entire sentence when an alternative word is not available, reinvolcing its content planner (McKeown, Robin, and Tanenblatt 1993).",
        "PLANDOC is an automated documentation system under joint development by Columbia and Bellcore.",
        "It produces one to two page reports documenting the activities of telephone planners.",
        "While PLANDOC does include a wide variety of paraphrases, some of which involve different word choices, and handles interactions between different choices, lexical choice was not the primary issue in this system.",
        "Instead, the focus was on the systematic use of conjunction with ellipsis and its interaction with syntagmatic paraphrases, in order to produce concise, yet fluent, summaries.",
        "FUF was used as a tool for developing the Lexical Chooser, but with less-novel results on the topic of lexical choice.",
        "Columbia also use FUF for lexical choice, but within a different system architecture: COOK (Smadja and McKeown 1991) and STREAK (Robin 1994b).",
        "Some of the examples discussed in this paper within the framework defined by the architecture of ADVISOR-II originated from the respective domains for which these two other systems were implemented.",
        "The focus in cocix, a system for generating stock market reports, was on interlexical constraints such as those presented in Section 5.",
        "By representing in FUF collocations that were automatically derived from a corpus of stock market reports, cool( could merge phrasal and single word constraints in the same lexicon as well as handle interactions between collocations.",
        "The way lexical choice is performed in coax differs from the way it is performed in all the other FuF-based systems in that it is not driven by a top-down traversal of the input conceptual structure.",
        "Instead, lexical entries (individual words or collocations) are chosen in a fixed order in terms of the syntactic function they will ultimately occupy in the output sentence: first the verb arguments, then the main verb, finally the adjuncts.",
        "This bottom-up regime is less efficient than the top-down regime for handling the structural constraints described in Section 4.",
        "However, it allows indexing the lexicon by <lexical item, syntactic function> pairs rather than by concepts, a property that is handy for using syntactically marked collocations auto",
        "matically produced by a domain-independent tool with no semantic knowledge such as XTRACT (Smadja 1991).",
        "The focus in STREAK was the definition of a draft-and-revision architecture for generating the type of very complex sentences used in newswire reports to summarize quantitative data about a basketball game and its historical background.",
        "STREAK relies on revision rules drawn from a corpus analysis of such reports (Robin and McKeown 1993) to incrementally generate such complex sentences.",
        "While the draft-and-revision approach of STREAK sets it apart from all the other FuF-based generators, the Lexical Chooser of STREAK is akin to the Lexical Chooser of ADVISOR-IT in that:",

        "• Its input is a linguistically unbiased flat semantic network.",
        "• It is based on top-down recursive functional unification.",

        "STREAK handles the structural constraints and the floating constraints in two separate passes.",
        "Structural constraints are handled during an initial draft-building pass and floating constraints during a subsequent revision pass.",
        "This is in contrast with ADVISOR-IT, which handles both types of constraints simultaneously.",
        "In STREAK, the Lexical Chooser is thus called first to build the draft and then again at each revision increment.",
        "The need for revision in STREAK primarily stems from the necessity in written summaries to concisely pack many facts into very complex sentences, as observed in newswire stories.",
        "For example, in the corpus of basketball reports that served as model output for STREAK, some sentences conveyed up to 12 conceptual relations and contained up to 46 words.",
        "In contrast, in the corpus of student advising sessions that served as model output for ADVISOR-II, no sentences conveyed more than four conceptual relations or contained more than 25 words.",
        "For the sentences of more ordinary complexity found in dialogues, revision is not needed and simultaneously combining semantic units into a single word can be achieved far more efficiently in a single pass."

        "It is at this point that the overall syntactic structure is determined.",
        "This lexical entry then usually invokes the lexical entries for the arguments to the head and this control is followed until all input arguments have been lexicalized.",

        "Lexical choice was not a major research issue in any of these systems (unlike the work presented here), with two exceptions: KALIPSOS and MU-based generators.",

        "In a phrasal lexicon entry, all the syntactic constraints between the elements of the template are already preselected, so there is no need for much syntactic realization: constituents are already ordered, their syntactic category is fixed in the phrasal template, closed-class words are already selected.",
        "Alternations like passivization or dative movement are encoded by defining, for each domain concept, several different templates, one for each combination of these orthogonal options (and thus failing to capture the generality of these syntactic transformations independently of specific words and concepts).",

        "Interlexical and pragmatic constraints are not discussed and we have some doubts about how easy it would be to incorporate them in this approach.",

        "Since all the possible combinations of alternative discourse organizations and alternative syntactic forms need to be hand-coded in the discourse grammar, this approach suffers from the same drawback as the phrasal lexicon approach: it is not compositional and thus does not scale up.",
        "Rubirtoff's (1992) IGEN also addresses the problem of the interaction between content decisions and linguistic decisions and implements an architecture that relies on explicit negotiation between the two components: the content planner requests a set of options from the Lexical Chooser to realize a certain conceptual element, and the Lexical Chooser replies with annotated options.",

        "By positioning the Lexical Chooser after content selection and before syntactic realization, both conceptual and linguistic constraints can influence word choice.",
        "Critically, our work has focused on the problem of floating constraints, providing a mechanism that allows the choice of a single word to realize several semantic concepts and conversely allows a single semantic concept to be realized by multiple words at distinct linguistic ranks.",
        "Our technique for lexical choice is characterized by the following features:",
        "• It is capable of handling a wide variety of constraints on lexical selection (co-occurrence restrictions, connotation of lexical items, syntactic and conceptual properties, and pragmatic effects).",
        "• Interaction among these constraints is easily handled through the use of a unification formalism to describe lexical entries.",
        "• Floating constraints can be attached at different levels of the generated syntactic structure, and several conceptual elements can be merged onto a single linguistic item, providing for more compact and lexically richer output.",
        "• Syntagmatic decisions are also made by the Lexical Chooser, so that an",
        "input conceptual structure can be mapped to a variety of linguistic structures.",
        "For example, the selection of \"perspective\" in a clause is guided by the available lexical resources (which verbs exist to express a given conceptual relation) and by pragmatic considerations (which relation is highlighted as the topic of the discourse).",
        "Our implementation of the Lexical Chooser as a functional unification grammar allows the separate, declarative representation of different constraints, with unification allowing for interaction between constraints.",
        "Furthermore, within this framework we have developed an algorithm for lexical selection, and the consequent building of syntactic structure, such that at each choice point in the structure, the Lexical Chooser considers all semantic concepts that can be realized, choosing a word that conveys as many as possible or discharging a concept to dependent linguistic sites, at the end checking that all concepts have been covered.",
        "In this framework, floating constraints can be merged with other semantic constraints at any linguistic rank.",
        "Finally, handling floating constraints requires that the same semantic structure is mapped to different syntactic structures in different contexts.",
        "Thus, a Lexical Chooser must also consider syntagmatic choice.",
        "We have presented an approach that allows perspective to be chosen depending on the discourse focus.",
        "Different relations may be chosen as the head of a syntactic structure, depending on the focus.",
        "This means that the generation system encodes no a priori assumptions about which domain concepts will be realized as which syntactic constituents.",
        "Any lexical selection algorithm that handles such a wide range of constraints must deal with the issue of computational complexity.",
        "To ensure an efficient Lexical Chooser, we have developed a collection of techniques in the FUF programming environment to limit the cost of operations required during lexical choice.",
        "We have described in this paper lazy evaluation (with the : wait annotation) and dependency-directed backtracking (with the : bk-class annotation) and shown how it reduces the cost of lexical",
