        "Dialogue act recognition is an essential task for dialogue systems.",
        "Automatic dialogue act classification has received much attention in the past years either as an independent task or as an embedded component in dialogue systems.",
        "Various methods have been tested on different corpora using several dialogue act classes and information coming from the user input.",
        "The work presented in this paper is part of a dialogue system called KomParse (Kliiwer et al., 2010), which is an application of a NL dialogue system combined with various question answering technologies in a three-dimensional virtual world named Twinity, a web-based online product of the Berlin startup company Metaversum.",
        "The KomParse NPCs provide various services through conversation with game users such as selling pieces of furniture to users via text based conversation.",
        "The main task of the input interpretation component of the agent is the detection of the dialogue acts contained in the user utterances.",
        "This classification is done via a cue-based method with various features from multilevel knowledge sources extracted from the incoming utterance considering a small context of the previous dialogue.",
        "In contrast to existing systems using mainly lexical features, i.e. words, single markers such as punctuation (Verbree et al., ) or combinations of various features (Stolcke et al., 2000) for the dialogue act classification, the results of the interpretation component presented in this paper are based on syntactic and semantic relations.",
        "The system first gathers linguistic information coming from different levels of deep linguistic processing similar to (Allen et al., 2007).",
        "The retrieved information is used as input for an information extraction component that delivers the relations embedded in the actual utterance (Xu et al., 2007).",
        "These relations combined with additional features (a small dialogue context and mood of the sentence) are then utilized as features for the machine-learning based recognition.",
        "The classifier is trained on a corpus originating from a Wizard-of-Oz experiment which was semi-automatically annotated.",
        "It contains automatically annotated syntactic relations namely, predicate argument structures, which were checked and corrected manually afterwards.",
        "Furthermore these relations are enriched by manual annotation with semantic frame information from VerbNet to gain an additional level of semantic richness.",
        "These two representations of relations, the syntax-based relations and the VerbNet semantic relations, were used in separate training steps to detect how much the classifier can benefit from either notations.",
        "A systematic analysis of the data has been conducted.",
        "It turns out that a comparatively small set of syntactic relations cover most utterances, which can moreover be expressed by an even smaller set of semantic relations.",
        "Because ofthis observation as well as the overall performance of the classifier the interpretation is extended with an additional rule based approach to ensure the robustness of the system.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview about existing dialogue act recognition systems and the features they use for classification.",
        "Section 3 introduces the original data used as basis for the annotation and the classification task.",
        "In Section 4 the annotation that provides the necessary information for the dialogue act classification and involves the relation extraction is described in detail.",
        "The annotation is split into three main steps: The annotation of dialogue information (section 4.1), the integration of syntactic information (section 4.2) and finally the manual annotation of VerbNet predicate and role information in section 4.3.",
        "Section 5 presents the results of the actual classification task using different feature sets and in Section 6 the results and methods are summarized.",
        "Finally, Section 7 provides a brief description of the rule-based interpretation and presents an outlook on future work."

        "Dialogue Acts (DAs) represent the functional level of a speaker's utterance, such as a greeting, a request or a statement.",
        "Dialogue acts are verbal or nonverbal actions that incorporate participant's intentions originating from the theory of Speech Acts by Searle and Austin (Searle, 1969).",
        "They provide an abstraction from the original input by detecting the intended action of an utterance, which is not necessarily inferable from the surface input (see the two requests in the following example).",
        "Can you show me a red car please?",
        "Please show me a red car!",
        "To detect the action included in an utterance, different approaches have been suggested in recent years which can be clustered into two main classes: The first class uses AI planning methods to detect the intention of the utterance based on belief states of the communicating agents and the world knowledge.",
        "These systems are often part of an entire dialogue system e.g. in a conversational agent which provides the necessary information about current beliefs and goals of the conversation participants at runtime.",
        "One example is the TRIPS system (Allen et al., 1996).",
        "Because of the huge amount of reasoning, systems in this class generally gather as much linguistic information as possible.",
        "The second class uses cues derived from the actual utterance to detect the right dialogue act, mostly using machine learning methods.",
        "This class gained much attention due to less computational costs.",
        "The probabilistic classifications are carried out via training on labeled examples of dialogue acts described by different feature sets.",
        "Frequently used cues for dialogue acts are lexical features such as the words of the utterance or ngrams of words for example in (Verbree et al., ), (Zimmermann et al., 2005) or (Webb and Liu, 2008).",
        "Although the performance of the classification task is difficult to compare, because of the variety of different corpora, dialogue act sets and algorithms used, these approaches do provide considerably good results.",
        "For example (Verbree et al., ) achieve accuracy values of 89% on the ICSI Meeting Corpus containing 80.000 utterances with a dialogue act set of 5 distinct dialogue act classes and amongst others the features \"ngrams of words\" and \"ngrams of POS information\".",
        "Another group of systems utilizes acoustic features derived from Automatic Speech Recognition for automatic dialogue act tagging (Surendran and Levow, 2006), context features like the preceding dialogue act or ngrams of previous dialogue acts (Keizer and Akker, 2006).",

        "From the annotated information the following elements were selected as features in the final recognition system:",
        "• The dialogue acts which carry the intentions of the actual utterance as well as the last preceding dialogue act.",

        "Arguments are labeled with numbers according to the found information for the actual structure.",
        "PropBank is organized in two layers, the first one being an underspecified representation of a sentence with numbered arguments, the second one containing fine-grained information about the semantic frames for the predicate comparable to FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "While the information in the second layer is stable for each verb, the values of the numbered arguments can change from verb to verb.",
        "While for one verb the \"arg0\" may refer to the subject of the verb, another verb may encapsulate a direct object behind the same notation \"arg0\".",
        "This is very complicated to handle in a computational setup, which needs continuous labeling for the successive components.",
        "Therefore the arguments were in general named as in PropBank but consistently numbered by syntactic structure.",
        "This means for example that the subject is always labeled as \"arg1\".",
        "Consider the example \"Can you put posters or pictures on the wall?\".",

        "For detecting verbs with two arguments in the input, for instance, a rule can be written describing the dependency structure for a verb with a subject and an object.",

        "The predicate argument parser is an standalone software and can be used either as a system component or for batch processing of a text corpus.",

        "For the manual addition of the semantic frame information a web-based annotation tool has been developed.",
        "The annotation tool shows the utterance which should be annotated in the context of the dialogue including the information from the preceding annotation steps.",
        "All VerbNet classes containing the current predicate are listed as possibilities for the predicate classification together with their syntactic frames.",
        "The annotators can select the appropriate predicate class and frame according to the arguments found in the utterance.",
        "If an argument is missing in the input that is required in the selected frame a null argument is added to the structure.",

        "In case the right predicate class is found but the fitting frame is missing, the frame is added to the VerbNet files.",
        "Thus during annotation 35 new members have been added to the existing VerbNet classes, 4 Frames and 4 new subclasses.",
        "Via these modifications, a version of VerbNet has been developed that can be regarded as a domain-specific VerbNet for the sales domain.",

        "In the syntactic predicate scenario the total number of different predicates is 80, whereas the semantic predicates build up a total number of 66.",
        "The class containing the predicates with one to ten occurrences constitutes 137 of 1239 instances.",
        "The remaining 1101 instances are covered by only 21 different predicate classes.",
        "These predicates together with their arguments constitute a set of common domain relations for the sales domain.",
        "The main domain relations found are shown in table 7.",
        "The figures suggest that the interpretation at least for the domain relations can be established in a robust manner, wherefore the agent's interpretation component was extended to a hybrid module including a robust rule based method.",
        "To derive the necessary rules a rule generator was developed and the rules covering the used feature set (including the context features, sentence mood and the syntactic relations) were automatically generated from the given data.",
        "Future work will focus on the evaluation of these automatically derived rules on a recently collected but not yet annotated dataset from a second Wizard-of-Oz experiment, carried out in the same furniture sales setting.",
        "Additional experiments are planned for evaluating the relation-based features in dialogue act recognition on other corpora tagged with different dialogue acts in order to test the overall performance of our classification approach on more transparent dialogue act sets."
