        "The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to produce a target sentence e from a source sentence f. Among all possible target language sentences the one with the highest probability is chosen:",
        "where Pr(f |e) is the translation model and Pr(e) is the target language model.",
        "This approach is usually referred to as the noisy source-channel approach in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "During the last few years, the use of context in SMT systems has provided great improvements in translation.",
        "SMT has evolved from the original word-based approach to phrase-based translation systems (Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "A phrase is defined as a group of source words f that should be translated together into a group of target words e. The translation model in phrase-based systems includes the phrase translation probabilities in both directions, i.e. P(e|f) and P(f |e).",
        "The use of a maximum entropy approach simplifies the introduction of several additional models explaining the translation process :",
        "The feature functions hi are the system models and the Ai weights are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function on a development set (Och and",
        "Ney, 2002).",
        "The phrase translation probabilities P(e|f) and P( f| e) are usually obtained using relative frequency estimates.",
        "Statistical learning theory, however, tells us that relative frequency estimates have several drawbacks, in particular high variance and low bias.",
        "Phrase tables may contain several millions of entries, most of which appear only once or twice, which means that we are confronted with a data sparseness problem.",
        "Surprisingly, there seems to be little work addressing the issue of smoothing of the phrase table probabilities.",
        "On the other hand, smoothing of relative frequency estimates was extensively investigated in the area of language modeling.",
        "A systematic comparison can be for instance found in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Language models and phrase tables have in common that the probabilities of rare events may be overestimated.",
        "However, in language modeling probability mass must be redistributed in order to account for the unseen n-grams.",
        "Generalization to unseen events is less important in phrase-based SMT systems since the system searches only for the best segmentation and the best matching phrase pair among the existing ones.",
        "We are only aware of one work that performs a systematic comparison of smoothing techniques in phrase-based machine translation systems (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "Two types of phrase-table smoothing were compared: black-box and glass-box methods.",
        "Black-methods do not look inside phrases but instead treat them as atomic objects.",
        "By these means, all the methods developed for language modeling can be used.",
        "Glass-box methods decompose P (e|f) into a set of lexical distributions P(e| f).",
        "For instance, it was suggested to use IBM-1 probabilities (Och et al., 2004), or other lexical translation probabilities (Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004).",
        "Some form of glass-box smoothing is now used in all state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems.",
        "Another approach related to phrase table smoothing is the so-called N-gram translation model (Marino et al., 2006).",
        "In this model, bilingual tuples are used instead of the phrase pairs and n-gram probabilities are considered rather than relative frequencies.",
        "Therefore, smoothing is obtained using the standard techniques developed for language modeling.",
        "In addition, a context dependence of the phrases is introduced.",
        "On the other hand, some restrictions on the segmentation of the source sentence must be used.",
        "N-gram-based translation models were extensively compared to phrase-based systems on several tasks and typically achieve comparable performance.",
        "In this paper we propose to investigate improved smoothing techniques in the framework of the N-gram translation model.",
        "Despite the undeniable success of n-graam back-off models, these techniques have several drawbacks from a theoretical point of view: the words are represented in a discrete space, the vocabulary.",
        "This prevents \"true interpolation\" of the probabilities of unseen n-grams since a change in this word space can result in an arbitrary change of the n-gram probability.",
        "An alternative approach is based on a continuous representation of the words (Bengio et al., 2003).",
        "The basic idea is to convert the word indices to a continuous representation and to use a probability estimator operating in this space.",
        "Since the resulting distributions are smooth functions of the word representation, better generalization to unknown n-grams can be expected.",
        "Probability estimation and interpolation in a continuous space is mathematically well understood and numerous powerful algorithms are available that can perform meaningful interpolations even when only a limited amount of training material is available.",
        "This approach was successfully applied to language modeling in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (Schwenk, 2007) and to language modeling in phrase-based SMT systems (Schwenk et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether this approach is useful to smooth the probabilities involved in the bilingual tuple translation model.",
        "Reliable estimation of unseen n-grams is very important in this translation model.",
        "Most of the trigram tuples encountered in the development or test data were never seen in the training data.",
        "N-gram hit rates are reported in the results section of this paper.",
        "We report experimental results for the Btec corpus as used in the 2006 evaluations of the international workshop on spoken language translation Iwslt (Paul, 2006).",
        "This task provides a very limited amount of resources in comparison to other tasks like the translation of journal texts (Nist evaluations) or of parliament speeches (Tc-Star evaluations).",
        "Therefore, new techniques must be deployed to take the best advantage of the limited resources.",
        "Among the language pairs tested in this years evaluation, Italian to English gave the best BLEU results in this year evaluation.",
        "The better the translation quality is, the more it is challenging to outperform it without adding more data.",
        "We show that a new smoothing technique for the translation model achieves a significant improvement in the BLEU score for a state-of-the-art statistical translation system.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we first describe the baseline statistical machine translation systems.",

        "The N-gram-based translation model has been derived from the finite-state perspective; more specifically, from the work of Casacuberta (2001).",
        "However, different from it, where the translation model is implemented by using a finite-state transducer, the N-gram-based system implements a bilingual N-gram model.",
        "It actually constitutes a language model of bilingual units, referred to as tuples, which approximates the joint probability between source and target languages by using N-grams, such as described by the following equation:",
        "where e refers to target, f to source and (e, f)k to the kth tuple of a given bilingual sentence pair.",
        "Bilingual units (tuples) are extracted from any word-to-word alignment according to the following constraints:",
        "• a monotonic segmentation of each bilingual sentence pairs is produced,",
        "• no word inside the tuple is aligned to words outside the tuple, and",
        "• no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraints.",
        "As a consequence of these constraints, only one segmentation is possible for a given sentence pair.",
        "Two important issues regarding this translation model must be considered.",
        "First, it often occurs that a large number of single-word translation probabilities are left out of the model.",
        "This happens for all words that are always embedded in tuples containing two or more words, then no translation probability for an independent occurrence of these embedded words will exist.",
        "To overcome this problem, the tuple trigram model is enhanced by incorporating 1-gram translation probabilities for all the embedded words detected during the tuple extraction step.",
        "These 1-gram translation probabilities are computed from the intersection of both the source-to-target and the target-to-source alignments.",
        "The second issue has to do with the fact that some words linked to NULL end up producing tuples with NULL source sides.",
        "Since no NULL is actually expected to occur in translation inputs, this type of tuple is not allowed.",
        "Any target word that is linked to NULL is attached either to the word that precedes or the word that follows it.",
        "To determine this, an approach based on the IBM1 probabilities was used, as described in (Marino et al., 2006).",
        "The following feature functions were used in the N-gram-based translation system:",
        "• A target language model.",
        "In the baseline system, this feature consists of a 4-gram back-off model of words, which is trained from the target side of the bilingual corpus.",
        "• A source-to-target lexicon model and a",
        "target-to-source lexicon model.",
        "These feature, which are based on the lexical parameters of the IBM Model 1, provide a complementary probability for each tuple in the translation table.",
        "• A word bonus function.",
        "This feature introduces a bonus based on the number of target words contained in the partial-translation hypothesis.",
        "It is used to compensate for the system's preference for short output sentences.",
        "All these models are combined in the decoder.",
        "Additionally, the decoder allows for a non-monotonic search with the following distorsion model.",
        "• A word distance-based distorsion model.",

        "Tuples need to be extracted by an unfolding technique (Marino et al., 2006).",
        "This means that the tuples are broken into smaller tuples, and these are sequenced in the order of the target words.",
        "In order not to lose the information on the correct order, the decoder performs a non-monotonic search.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of tuple unfolding compared to the monotonic extraction.",

        "Phrase-based approaches are the de-facto standard in statistical machine translation.",
        "The phrases are extracted automatically from the word alignments of parallel texts, and the different possible translations of a phrase are weighted using relative frequency.",
        "This can be problematic when the data is sparse.",
        "However, there seems to be little work on possible improvements of the relative frequency estimates by some smoothing techniques.",
        "It is today common practice to use additional feature functions like IBM-1 scores to obtain some kind of smoothing (Och et al., 2004; Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004), but better estimation of the phrase probabilities is usually not addressed.",
        "An alternative way to represent phrases is to define bilingual tuples.",
        "Smoothing, and context dependency, is obtained by using an n-gram model on these tuples.",
        "In this work, we have extended this approach by using a new smoothing technique that operates on a continuous representation of the tuples.",
        "Our method is distinguished by two characteristics: better estimation of the numerous unseen n-grams, and a discriminative estimation of the tuple probabilities.",
        "Results are provided on the Btec task of the 2006 Iwslt evaluation for the translation direction Italian to English.",
        "This task provides very limited amount of resources in comparison to other tasks.",
        "Therefore, new techniques must be deployed to take the best advantage of the limited resources.",
        "We have chosen the Italian to English task because it is challenging to enhance a good quality translation task (over 40 BLEU percentage).",
        "Using the continuous space model for the translation and target language model, an improvement of 2.5 BLEU on the development data and 1.5 BLEU on the test data was observed.",
        "Despite these encouraging results, we believe that additional research on improved estimation of probabilities in N-gram-or phrase-based statistical machine translation systems is needed.",
        "In particular, the problem of generalization to new translations seems to be promising to us.",
        "This could be addressed by the so-called factored phrase-based model as implemented in the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "In this approach words are decomposed into several factors.",
        "These factors are translated and a target phrase is generated.",
        "This model could be complemented by a factored continuous tuple N-gram.",
        "Factored word language models were already successfully used in speech recognition (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2006) and an extension to machine translation seems to be promising.",
        "The described smoothing method was explicitly developed to tackle the data sparseness problem in tasks like the Btec corpus.",
        "It is well known from language modeling that careful smoothing is less important when large amounts of data are available.",
        "We plan to investigate whether this also holds for smoothing of the probabilities in phrase-or tuple-based statistical machine translation systems."
