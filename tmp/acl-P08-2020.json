        "Building a full scale Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system involves many preparation and training steps and it consists of several components, each of which contribute to the overall system performance.",
        "Between 2007 and 2008 our system improved by 5 points in BLEU from 26.60 to 31.85 for the unseen MT06 test set, which can be mainly attributed to two major points.",
        "The fast growth of computing resources over the years make it possible to use larger and larger amounts of data in training.",
        "In Section 3 we show how parallelizing model training can reduce training time by an order of magnitude and how using larger training data as well as more extensive models improve translation quality.",
        "Word reordering is still a difficult problem in SMT.",
        "In Section 4 we apply a Part Of Speech (POS) based syntactic reordering model successfully to our large Chinese system.",
        "Our translation system is based on the CMU SMT decoder as described in (Hewavitharana et al., 2005).",
        "Our decoder is a phrase-based beam search decoder, which combines multiple models e.g. phrase tables, several language models, a distortion model ect.",
        "in a log-linear fashion.",
        "In order to find an optimal set of weights, we use MER training as described in (Venugopal et al., 2005), which uses rescoring of the top n hypotheses to maximize an evaluation metric like BLEU or TER.",
        "In this paper we report results using the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), however as the evaluation criterion in GALE is HTER (Snover et al., 2006), we also report in TER (Snover et al., 2005).",
        "We used the test sets from the NIST MT evaluations from the years 2003 and 2006 as development and unseen test data.",
        "In translation model training we used the Chinese-English bilingual corpora relevant to GALE available through the LDC.",
        "After sentence alignment these sources add up to 10.7 million sentences with 301 million running words on the English side.",
        "Our preprocessing steps include tokenization on the English side and for Chinese: automatic word segmentation using the revised version of the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) from 2007, replacement of traditional by simplified Chinese characters and 2-byte to 1-byte ASCII character normalization.",
        "After data cleaning steps like e.g. removal of sentence pairs with very unbalanced sentence length etc., we used the remaining 10 million sentences with 260 million words (English) in translation model training (260M system)."

      "heading": "2. Number Tagging",
      "text": [
        "Systematic tagging and pre-translation of numbers had shown significant improvements for our Arabic-English system, so we investigated this for Chinese-English.",
        "The baseline for these experiments was a smaller system with 67 million words (67M) bilingual training data (English) and a 500 million word 3-gram LM with a BLEU score of 27.61 on MT06.",
        "First we pre-translated all numbers in the testdata only, thus forcing the decoder to treat the numbers as unknown words.",
        "Probably because the system could not match longer phrases across the pre-translated numbers, the overall translation quality degraded by 1.6 BLEU to 26.05 (see Table 1).",
        "We then tagged all numbers in the training corpus, replaced them with a placeholder tag and retrained the translation model.",
        "This reduced the vocabulary and enabled the decoder to generalize longer phrases across numbers.",
        "This strategy did not lead to the expected result, the BLEU score for MT06 only reached 25.97 BLEU.",
        "Analysing this in more detail, we found, the reason for this degradation in translation quality could be the unbalanced occurrence of number tags in the training data.",
        "From the bilingual sentence pairs, which contain number tags, 66.52% do not contain the same number of tags on the Chinese and the English side.",
        "As a consequence 52% of the phrase pairs in the phrase table, which contain number tags had to be removed, because the tags were unbalanced.",
        "This hurts system performance considerably."

      "heading": "3. Scaling up to Large Data 3.1 Language Model",
      "text": [
        "Due to the availability of more computing resources, we were able to extend the language model history from 4 to 5-gram, which improved translation quality from 29.49 BLEU to 30.22 BLEU for our large scale 260M system (see Table 2).",
        "This shows, that longer LM histories help if we are able to use enough data in model training.",
        "The language model was trained on the sources from the English Gigaword Corpus V3, which contains several newspapers for the years between 1994 to 2006.",
        "We also included the English side of the bilingual training data, resulting in a total of 2.7 billion running words after tokenization.",
        "We trained separate open vocabulary language models for each source and interpolated them using the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Table 3 shows the interpolation weights for the different sources.",
        "Apart from the English part of the bilingual data, the newswire data from the Chinese Xinhua News Agency and the Agence France Press have the largest weights.",
        "This reflects the makeup of the test data, which comes in large parts from these sources.",
        "Other sources, as for example the UN par-lamentary speeches or the New York Times, differ significantly in style and vocabulary from the test data and therefore get small weights.",
        "To accelerate the training of word alignment models we implemented a distributed version of GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), based on the latest version of GIZA++ and a parallel version developed at Peking University (Lin et al., 2006).",
        "We divide the bilingual training data in equal parts and distribute it over several processing nodes, which perform alignment independently.",
        "In each iteration the nodes read the model from the previous step and output all necessary counts from the data for the models, e.g. the co-occurrence or fertility model.",

        "Also using a simple distance based distortion probability leaves it essentially to the language model to select among different reorderings.",
        "An alternative is to apply automatically learned reordering rules to the test sentences before decoding (Crego and Marino, 2006).",
        "We create a word lattice, which encodes many re-orderings and allows long distance reordering.",
        "This keeps the translation process in the decoder monotone and makes it significantly faster compared to allowing long distance reordering at decoding time.",
        "We tag both language sides of the bilingual corpus with POS information using the Stanford Parserand extract POS based reordering patterns from word alignment information.",
        "We use the context in which a reordering pattern is seen in the training data as an additional feature.",
        "Context refers to the words or tags to the left or to the right of the sequence for which a reordering pattern is extracted.",
        "Relative frequencies are computed for every rule that has been seen more than n times in the training corpus (we observed good results for n > 5).",
        "For the Chinese system we used only 350k bilingual sentence pairs to extract rules with length of up to 15.",
        "We did not reorder the training corpus to retrain the translation model on modified Chinese word order.",
        "To avoid hard decisions, we build a lattice structure for each source sentence as input for our decoder, which contains reordering alternatives consistent with the previously extracted rules.",
        "Longer reordering patterns are applied first.",
        "Thereby shorter patterns can match along new paths, creating short distance reordering on top of long distance reordering.",
        "Every outgoing edge of a node is scored with the relative frequency of the pattern used on the following sub path (For details see (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007)).",
