        "We can distinguish two levels in newspaper articles: the pure information, here called primary information, and the meta-information, which embeds the primary information within a perspective, a belief context, or a modality, which we call circumstantial information.",
        "The distinction is not limited to, but is best illustrated by, reported speech sentences.",
        "Here the matrix clause or reporting clause corresponds to the circumstantial information, while the complement (whether realized as a full clause or as a noun phrase) corresponds to primary information.",
        "For tasks such as knowledge extraction it is the primary information that is of interest.",
        "For example in the text of Figure 1 the matrix clauses (italicized) give the circumstantial information of the who, when and how of the reporting event, while what is reported (the primary information) is given in the complements.",
        "The particular reporting verb also adds important information about the manner of the original utterance, the preciseness of the quote, the temporal relationship between matrix clause and complement, and more.",
        "In addition, the source of the original information provides information about the reliability or credibility of the primary information.",
        "Because the individual reporting verbs differ slightly but importantly in this respect, it is the lexical semantics that must account for such knowledge.",
        "US Advising Third Parties on Hostages (RI) The Bush administration continued to insist yesterday that (CI) it is not involved in negotiations over the Western hostages in Lebanon, (R2) but acknowledged that (C2) US officials have provided advice to and have been kept informed by \"people at all levels\" who are holding such talks.",

        "Our goal is, however, to show a minimal requirement on the lexical semantics of the words in-volvdd, thereby enabling us to attempt a solution to the larger problems in text analysis.",
