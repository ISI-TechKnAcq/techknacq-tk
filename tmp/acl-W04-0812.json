        "Two linguists disambiguated the texts.",
        "The annotators made every effort to match a text word to a IWN sense, but sometimes this could not be done, since the required sense was not present in the reference resource.",
        "Cases of difficult sense attribution and of disagreement between annotators were marked and left to further discussion and refinement.",
        "Frequently, a tight interaction between the IWN developers and the annotators was needed.",
        "By the way, this collaboration produced a double-sided effect: on the one side, the lexical resource gained in coverage, being enlarged through the addition of missing entries and/or senses and, on the other side, the corpus encoding has been made possible."
