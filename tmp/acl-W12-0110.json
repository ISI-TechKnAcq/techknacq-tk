        "Automatic collection of corpora is preferred to manual, and for that purpose a set of simple crawlers was designed.",
        "They are modified for each source to ensure efficiency.",
        "Figure 1 presents some statistical data for the Bulgarian-English parallel corpus, the largest in the collection (the vertical axis shows the number of words, while the horizontal - the domain distribution).",
        "Figure 1 Bulgarian-English parallel corpus Two basic methods are used to enlarge the existing parallel corpora.",
        "In the first, the available training data for statistical machine translation are extended by means of generating paraphrases (e.g. compound nouns are paraphrased into (semi-) equivalent phrases with a preposition, and vice versa).",
        "The paraphrases can be classified as morphological (where the difference is between the forms of the phrase constituents), lexical (based on semantic similarity between constituents) and phrasal (based on syntactic transformations).",
        "Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010.",
        "For instance, one of the methods for paraphrase generation from a monolingual corpus considers as paraphrases all words and phrases that are distributionally similar, that is, occurring with the",
        "same sets of anchors (Pa?ca and Dienes 2005).",
        "An approach using phrase-based alignment techniques shows how paraphrases in one language can be identified using a phrase in a second language as a pivot (Bannard and Callison-Burch 2005).",
        "The second method performs automatic generation of parallel corpora (Xu and Sun 2011) by means of automatic translation.",
        "This method can be applied for language pairs for which parallel corpora are still limited in quantity.",
        "If, say, a Bulgarian-English parallel corpus exists, a Bulgarian Polish parallel corpus can be constructed by means of automatic translation from English to Polish.",
        "To control the quality of the automatically generated data, multiple translation systems can be used, and the compatibility of the translated outputs can be calculated.",
        "Thus, both methods can fill gaps in the available data, the first method by extending existing parallel corpora and the second by automatic construction of parallel corpora."

        "Given that the ATLAS platform deals with languages from different language families and that the engine should support several domains, an interlingua approach is not suitable.",

        "The ATLAS translation engine interacts with other modules of the system.",
        "For example, the document categorisation module assigns one or more domains to each document, and if no specific trained translation model for the respective domain exists, the user gets a warning that the translation may be inadequate with respect to lexical coverage.",
        "Each input item to the translation engine is then processed by the example-based machine translation component.",
        "If the input as a whole or important chunks of it are found in the translation database, the translation equivalents are used and, if necessary, combined (Gavrila 2011).",
        "In all other cases the input is sent further to the Moses-based machine translation component which uses a part-of-speech and domain-factored model (Niehues and Waibel 2010).",
        "Like the architecture of the categorization engine, the translation system in ATLAS is able to accommodate and use different third-party translations engines, such as those of Google, Bing, and Yahoo.",
        "The ATLAS machine translation module is still under development.",
        "Some experiments in translation between English, German, and Romanian have been performed in order to define: what parameter settings are suitable for language pairs with a rich morphology, what tuning steps lead to significant improvements, wheather the PoS-factored models improve significantly the quality of results (Karagyozov et al. 2012)."
