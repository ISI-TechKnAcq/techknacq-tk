        "A promising approach, called distant or weak supervision, is to exploit an existing database of facts as training data, by aligning it to an unlabeled collection of text documents (Craven and Kumlien, 1999).",
        "In this article, we are interested in weakly supervised extraction of binary relations.",
        "A challenge pertaining to weak supervision is that the obtained training data is noisy and ambiguous (Riedel et al., 2010).",

        "Weak supervision thus lead to ambiguous examples.",
        "This challenge is illustrated in Fig. 1.",
        "A solution to address it is to formulate the task of weakly supervised relation extraction as a multiple instance, multiple label learning problem (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012).",

        "2 Related work Supervised learning.",
        "Many approaches based on supervised learning have been proposed to solve the problem of relation extraction, and the corresponding literature is to large to be summarized here.",
        "One of the first supervised method for relation extraction was inspired by syntactic pars-ing: the system described by Miller et al. (1998) combines syntactic and semantic knowledge, and thus, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, named entity recognition and relation extraction all happen at the same time.",
        "The problem of relation extraction was later formulated as a classification problem: Kambhatla (2004) proposed to solve this problem using maximum entropy models using lexical, syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Kernel methods for relation extraction, based on shallow parse trees or dependency trees were introduced by Zelenko et al. (2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney (2005).",
        "Unsupervised learning.",
        "The open information extraction paradigm, simultaneously proposed by Shinyama and Sekine (2006) and Banko et al. (2007), does not rely on any labeled data or even existing relations.",
        "Instead, open information extraction systems only use an unlabeled corpus, and output a set of extracted relations.",
        "Such systems are based on clustering (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) or self-supervision (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "One of the limitations of these systems is the fact that they extract uncanonicalized relations.",
        "Weakly supervised learning.",
        "Weakly supervised learning refers to a broad class of meth-ods, in which the learning system only have access to partial, ambiguous and noisy labeling.",
        "Craven and Kumlien (1999) were the first to propose a weakly supervised relation extractor.",
        "They aligned a knowledge database (the Yeast Protein Database) with scientific articles mentioning a particular relation, and then used the extracted sentences to learn a classifier for extracting that relation.",
        "Later, many different sources of weak label-ings have been considered.",
        "Bellare and McCallum (2007) proposed a method to extract bibliographic relations based on conditional random fields and used a database of BibTex entries as weak supervision.",
        "Wu and Weld (2007) described a method to learn relations based on Wikipedia infoboxes.",
        "Knowledge databases, such as Freebase 1 (Mintz et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2011) and YAGO 2 (Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011) were also considered as a source of weak supervision.",
        "Multiple instance learning.",
        "The methods we previously mentionned transform the weakly supervised problem into a fully supervised one, leading to noisy training datasets (see Fig. 1).",
        "Mul-1 www.freebase.com 2 www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago 1581 tiple instance learning (Dietterich et al., 1997) is a paradigm in which the learner receives bags of examples instead of individual examples.",
        "A positively labeled bag contains at least one positive example, but might also contains negative examples.",
        "In the context of relation extraction, Bunescu and Mooney (2007) introduced a kernel method for multiple instance learning, while Riedel et al. (2010) proposed a solution based on a graphical model.",
        "Both these methods allow only one label per bag, which is an asumption that is not true for relation extraction (see Fig. 1).",
        "Thus, Hoffmann et al. (2011) proposed a multiple instance, multiple label method, based on an undirected graphical model, to solve the problem of weakly supervised relation extraction.",
        "Finally, Surdeanu et al. (2012) also proposed a graphical model to solve this problem.",
        "One of their main contributions is to capture dependencies between relation labels, such as the fact that two labels cannot be generated jointly (e.g. the relations SpouseOf and BornIn).",

        "The goal of discriminative clustering is to find a labeling of the data points leading to a classifier with low classification error.",
        "Different formulations of discriminative clustering have been proposed, based on support vector machines (Xu et al., 2004), the squared loss (Bach and Harchaoui, 2007) or the logistic loss (Joulin et al., 2010).",
        "A big advantage of discriminative clustering is that weak supervision or prior information can easily be incorporated.",

        "Given a set of entities, a binary relation r is a collection of ordered pairs of entities.",
        "The statement that a pair of entities (e 1 , e 2 ) belongs to the relation r is denoted by r(e 1 , e 2 ) and this triple is called a fact or relation instance.",

        "A given pair of entities, such as (Edouard Manet, Paris), can belong to different relations, such as BornIn and DiedIn.",
        "An entity mention is a contiguous sequence of tokens refering to an entity, while a pair mention or relation mention candidate is a sequence of text in which a pair of entities is mentioned.",
        "In the following, relation mention candidates will be restricted to pair of entities that are mentioned in the same sentence.",
        "For example, the sentence: Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park.",
        "contains two entity mentions, corresponding to two relation mention candidates.",
        "In-deed, the pairs (Hemingway, Oak Park) and (Oak Park, Hemingway) are two distinct pairs of entities, where only the first one verifies the relation BornIn.",
        "Given a text corpus, aggregate extraction corresponds to the task of extracting a set of facts, such that each extracted fact is expressed at least once in the corpus.",
        "On the other hand, the task of sentential extraction corresponds to labeling each relation mention candidate by the relation it expresses, or by a None label if it does not express any relation.",
        "Given a solution to the sentential extraction problem, it is possible to construct a solution for the aggregate extraction problem by returning all the facts that were detected.",
        "We will follow this approach, by building an instance level classifier, and aggregating the results by extracting the facts that were detected at least once in the corpus.",
        "In the following, we will describe a method to learn such a classifier using a database of facts instead of a set of labeled sentences.",
        "This setting is known as distant supervision or weak supervi-sion, since we do not have access to labeled data on which we could directly train a sentence level relation extractor.",
        "4 General approach In this section, we propose a two step procedure to solve the problem of weakly supervised relation extraction: 1.",
        "First, we describe a method to infer the relation labels corresponding to each relation mention candidate of our training set, 2.",
        "Second, we train a supervised instance level relation extractor, using the labels infered during step 1.",
        "In the second step of our approach, we will simply use a multinomial logistic regression model.",

        "Lexical features include: the sequence of words between the two entities, a window of k words before the first entity and after the second entity, the corresponding part-of-speech tags, etc.. Syntactic features are based on the dependency tree of the sentence, and include: the path between the two entities, neigh-bors of the two entities that do not belong to the path.",
        "The OpenNLP 3 part-of-speech tagger and the Malt parser (Nivre et al., 2007) were used to extract those features.",

        "We normalized the kernel matrix XX > , so that its diagonal coefficients are equal to 1.",
        "This corresponds to normalizing the vectors x n so that they have a unit ` 2 -norm.",
        "Choice of parameters.",
        "We kept 20% of the examples from the training set as a validation set, in order to choose the parameters of our method.",
        "We then re-train a model on the whole training set, using the chosen parameters.",
        "7 Experimental evaluation In this section, we evaluate our approach to weakly supervised relation extraction by comparing it to state-of-the art methods.",
        "7.1 Baselines We now briefly present the different methods we compare to.",
        "Mintz et al.",
        "This baseline corresponds to the method described by Mintz et al. (2009).",
        "We use the implementation of Surdeanu et al. (2012), which slightly differs from the original method: each relation mention candidate is treated independently (and not collapsed across mentions for a given entity pair).",
        "This strategy allows to predict multiple labels for a given entity pair, by OR-ing the predictions for the different mentions.",
        "Hoffmann et al.",
        "This method, introduced by Hoffmann et al. (2011), is based on probabilistic graphical model of multi-instance multi-label learning.",
        "They proposed a learning method for this model, based on the perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) and a greedy search for the inference.",
        "We use the publicly available code of Hoffmann et al. 4 .",
        "Surdeanu et al.",
        "Finally, we compare our method to the one described by Surdeanu et al. (2012).",

        "In particular, this second layer capture dependencies between relation labels, such as the fact that two labels cannot be generated jointly (e.g. the relations SpouseOf and BornIn).",
        "This model is trained by using hard discriminative Expectation-Maximization.",
        "We use the publicly available code of Surdeanu et al. 5 .",
        "7.2 Precision / recall curves Following standard practices in relation extrac-tion, we report precision/recall curves for the different models.",
        "In order to rank aggregate extractions for our model, the score of an extracted fact r(e 1 , e 2 ) is set to the maximal score of the different extractions of that fact.",
        "This is sometimes refered to as the soft-OR function.",
        "7.3 Discussion Comparison with the state-of-the-art.",
        "We report results for the different methods on the dataset 5 nlp.stanford.edu/software/mimlre.shtml introduced by Riedel et al. (2010) in Fig. 3.",
        "We observe that our approach generally outperforms the state of the art.",
        "Indeed, at equivalent recall, our method achieves better (or similar) precision than the other methods, except for very low recall (smaller than 0.05).",
        "The improvement over the methods proposed by Hoffmann et al. (2011) and Surdeanu et al. (2012), which are currently the best published results on this dataset, can be as high as 5 points in precision for the same recall point.",
        "Moreover, our method achieves a higher recall (0.30) than these two methods (0.25).",
        "Performance per relation.",
        "The dataset introduced by Riedel et al. (2010) is highly unbalanced: for example, the most common relation, /location/location/contains, represents almost half of the positive relations, while some relations are mentioned less than ten times.",
        "We thus decided to also report precision/recall curves for the five most common relations of that dataset in Fig. 4.",
        "First, we observe that the perfomances vary a lot from a relation to another.",
        "The frequence of the different relations is not the 1587 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7Recall 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Prec ision Hoffmann et al.

        "only factor in those discrepancies.",
        "Indeed, the relation /people/person/place lived and the relation /people/person/place of birth are more frequent than the relation /business/person/company, but the extraction of the later works much better than the extraction of the two first.",
        "Upon examination of the data, this can partly be explained by the fact that almost no sentences extracted for the relation /people/person/place of birth in fact express this relation.",
        "In other words, many facts present in Freebase are not expressed in the corpus, and are thus impossible to extract.",
        "On the other hand, most facts for the relation /people/person/place lived are missing in Freebase.",
        "Therefore, many extractions produced by our system are considered false, but are in fact true positives.",
        "The problem of incomplete knowledge base was studied by Min et al. (2013).",
        "Sentential extraction.",
        "We finally report preci-sion/recall curves for the task of sentential extrac-tion, in Fig. 5, using the manually labeled dataset of Hoffmann et al. (2011).",
        "We observe that for most values of recall, our method achieves similar precision that the one proposed by Hoffmann et al. (2011), while extending the highest recall from 0.52 to 0.68.",
        "Thanks to this higher recall, our method achieves a highest F1 score of 0.66, compared to 0.61 obtained by the method proposed by Hoffmann et al. (2011).",

        "8 Conclusion In this article, we introduced a new formulation for weakly supervised relation extraction.",
        "Our method is based on a constrained discriminative formulation of the multiple instance, multiple label learning problem.",
        "Using the squared loss, we obtained a convex relaxation of this formula-tion, allowing us to obtain an approximate solution to the initial integer quadratic program.",
        "Thus, our method is not sensitive to initialization.",
        "We demonstrated the competitiveness of our approach on the dataset introduced by Riedel et al. (2010), on which our method outperforms the state of the art methods for weakly supervised relation extrac-tion, on both aggregate and sentential extraction.",
        "As noted earlier, another advantage of our method is the fact that it is easily kernelizable.",
        "We would like to explore the use of kernels, such as the ones introduced by Zelenko et al. (2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney (2005), in future work.",
        "We believe that such kernels could improve the relatively low recall obtained so far by weakly supervised method for relation extraction.",
