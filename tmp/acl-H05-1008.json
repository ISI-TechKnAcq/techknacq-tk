        "Information Extraction (IE) is a technology for finding facts in plain text, and coding them in a logical representation, such as, e.g., a relational database.",

        "Resolution of co-reference among entities 5.",
        "Pattern-based event matching and role mapping 6.",
        "Normalization and output generation",
        "While accuracy at the lowest levels can reach high 90’s, as the stages advance, complexity increases and performance degrades considerably.",
        "The problem of IE as a whole, as well each of the listed subproblems, has been studied intensively for well over a decade, in many flavors and varieties.",
        "Key observations about much state-of-the-art IE are: a. IE is typically performed by a pipeline process; b.",
        "Only one hypothesis is propagated through the pipeline for each fact – the “best guess” the system can make for each slot fill; c. IE is performed in a document-by-document fashion, applying a priori knowledge locally to each document.",
        "The a priori knowledge may be encoded in a set of rules, an automatically trained model, or a hybrid thereof.",
        "Information extracted from documents – which may be termed a posteriori knowledge – is usually not reused across document boundaries, because the extracted facts are imprecise, and are therefore not a reliable basis for future extraction.",
        "Furthermore, locally non-best slot fills are not propagated through the pipeline, and are consequently not available downstream, nor for any global analysis.",
        "In most systems, these stages are performed in sequence.",
        "The locally-best slot fills are passed from",
        "the “lower-” to the “higher-level” modules, without feedback.",
        "Improvements are usually sought (e.g., the ACE research programme, (ACE, 2004)) by boosting performance at the lower levels, to reap benefits in the subsequent stages, where fewer errors are propagated.",
        "The point of departure for this paper is: the IE process is noisy and imprecise at the single-document level; this has been the case for some time, and though there is much active research in the area, the situation is not likely to change radically in the immediate future – rather, we can expect slow, incremental improvements over some years.",
        "In our experiments, we approach the performance problem from the opposite end: start with the extracted results and see if the totality of a posteriori knowledge about the domain – knowledge generated by the same noisy process we are trying to improve – can help recover from errors that stem from locally insufficient a priori knowledge.",
        "The aim of the research presented in this paper is to improve performance by aggregating related facts, which were extracted from a large document collection, and to examine to what extent the correctly extracted facts can help correct those that were extracted erroneously.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 contains a brief review of relevant prior work.",
        "Section 3 presents the experimental setup: the text corpus, the IE process, the extracted facts, and what aspects of the the extracted facts we try to improve in this paper.",
        "Section 4 presents the methods for improving the quality of the data using global analysis, starting with a naive, baseline method, and proceeding with several extensions.",
        "Each method is then evaluated, and the results are examined in section 5.",
        "In section 6, we present further extensions currently under research, followed by the conclusion."

        "It is our view that to improve performance we ought to depart from the traditional linear, pipeline-style design.",
        "This view is shared by others in the research community; the potential benefits have previously been recognized in several contexts.",
        "In (Nahm and Mooney, 2000a; Nahm and Mooney, 2000b), it was shown that learning rules from a fact base, extracted from a corpus ofjob postings for computer programmers, improves future extraction, even though the originally extracted facts themselves are far from error-free.",
        "The idea is to mine the data base for association rules, and then to integrate these rules into the extraction process.",
        "The baseline system is obtained by supervised learning from a few hundred manually annotated examples.",
        "Then the IE system is applied to successively larger sets of unlabeled examples, and association rules are mined from the extracted facts.",
        "The resulting combined system (trained model plus association rules) showed an improvement in performance on a test set, which correlated with the size of the unlabeled corpus.",
        "In work on improving (Chinese) named entity tagging, (Ji and Grishman, 2004; Ji and Grishman, 2005), show benefits to this component from integrating decisions made in later stages, viz. co-reference, and relation extraction.1 Tighter coupling and integration between IE and KDD components for mutual benefit is advocated by (McCallum and Jensen, 2003), which present models based on CRFs and supervised training.",
        "This work is related in spirit to the work presented in this paper, in its focus on leveraging cross-document information that information – though it is inherently noisy – to improve local decisions.",

        "However, other textual features of the state candidate should contribute to establishing the relations",
        "to a location mention, besides the raw distance.",
        "For example, at a given distance, it is very important whether the state is mentioned before the location (more likely to be related) vs. after the location (less likely).",
        "Another important feature: is the state mentioned in the main story/report headline?",
        "If so, its score should be raised.",
        "It is quite common for documents to declaim the focal state only once in the headline, and never mention it again, instead mentioning other states, neighboring, or otherwise relevant to the story.",
        "The distance measure used alone may be insufficient in such cases.",
        "How are these features to be combined?",
        "One path is to use some combination of features, such as a weighted sum, with parameters trained on a manually tagged data set.",
        "As we already have a reasonably sized set tagged for evaluation, we can split it into two, train the parameter on a larger portion, evaluate on a smaller one, and cross-validate.",
        "We will be using this approach as a baseline.",
        "However, we aim to use a much larger set of data to train the parameters, without manually tagging large training sets.",
        "The idea is to treat the set of incidents with high record confidence, Sec. 4.3, rather than manually tagged data, as ground truth.",
        "Again, there “confident” truth will not be completely error-free, but because error rates are lower among the confident records, we may be able to leverage global analysis to produce the desired effect: training parameters for more complex models – involving multiple features – for global re-ranking of decisions."

        "Our approach rests on the idea that evidence aggregated across documents should help resolve difficult problems at the level of a given document.",
        "Our experiments confirm that aggregating global information about related facts, and propagating locally non-best analyses through the pipeline, provide powerful sources of additional evidence, which are able to reverse incorrect decisions, based only on local and a priori information.",
        "The proposed approach requires no supervision or training of any kind.",
        "It does, however require a substantial collection of evidence across a large body of extracted records; this approach needs a “critical mass” of data to be effective.",
