        "Our corpus evidence concerning these long-distance pronominal references, as well as studies of the use of descriptions, proper names and ambiguous uses of pronouns, lead us to conclude that a discourse focus stack mechanism of the type proposed by Sidner is essential to account for the use of these referring expressions.",

        "We call LONG-DISTANCE PRONOMINALISATIONS those cases of pronoun use in which the antecedent of the pronoun does not occur either in the same sentence as the pronoun or in the immediately preceding one, but further back in the text.",
        "These cases are thought to be rare on the basis of studies such as (Hobbs, 1978), which found that 98% of pronoun antecedents in the corpus analysed were in the same sentence as the pronoun or the previous one.",
        "However, our analysis of a small corpus of oral descriptions of museum items collected for the ILEX project (Hitzeman et al., 1997) revealed that long-distance pronouns are much more common in this kind of data – four times as common, in fact: out of a total of 83 pronouns, 7 (8.4%) were long-distance.",
        "The typical pattern of long-distance pronominalisation in the ILEX dialogues is shown in (1), where the pronoun him in the last sentence refers to the jeweller, mentioned most recently two sentences earlier.",
        "(1) JO: Okay, thank you.",
        "Shall we look at the object in case number 16, number 1?",
        "There's a set of three objects here.",
        "LG: I.",
        "Yes.",
        "2.",
        "What these symbolise for me are one of the preoccupations of the 1980s, which is recycling.",
        "3.",
        "The jeweller who made these bangles was particularly interested in the idea of using intrinsically worthless material – material that had been thrown away, old junk – and he lavished on those materials an incredibly painstaking and time-consuming technique, so that the amount of time put into the labour of making these jewels bears absolutely no relation to the value of the materials that he's used.",
        "4.",
        "And if you look at, for instance, the bangle at the bottom – that's the blue and red one – what looks as though it's painted decoration is in fact inlaid; it's bits of cut-off razor-blade, biro.",
        "knitting needles, inlaid into layer after layer of resin, which is done in emulation of Japanese lacquer technique.",
        "5.",
        "And that particular bangle took him something like 120 hours of work.",
        "All 7 long-distance pronouns in the ILEX dialogues we have studied refer to discourse entities introduced in background text in this way.",
        "Unlike Sidner's theory of focus (Sidner, 1979), the theory of the attentional state in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) (henceforth: G&S) does not include explicit provision for long-distance pronominalisa-tions, although some of the necessary tools are potentially already there, as we will see.",
        "The component of the theory that deals with pronominal reference, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), only accounts for cases in which the antecedent of a pronoun is introduced by the previous sentence; cases such as (1) have to be handled by different mechanisms.",
        "In this paper we look the phenomenon of long-distance pronominalisation in some detail, examining data from different domains, and consider",
        "its implications for G&S's theory.",
        "2 Theories of focus Space unfortunately prevents a full discussion of Grosz's (1977), Sidner's (1979), and G&S's (1986) theories of focus and the attentional state in this abstract.",
        "The crucial aspects of these theories, for the purpose of the discussion below, are as follows.",
        "First of all, G&S propose a distinction between two components of the attentional state: the GLOBAL FOCUS, structured as a stack of focus spaces and accessed to interpret definite descriptions; and the LOCAL FOCUS, consisting of the information preferentially used to interpret pronouns.",
        "In addition, they adopt CENTERING THEORY (Grosz et al., 1995) as a theory of the local focus.",
        "Secondly, although G&S's theory integrates ideas from both Grosz's and Sidner's original theories, and although both of these theories assumed a stack structure, the global focus in G&S's theory is structured as a stack of focus spaces, as in Grosz's original proposal, rather than as a stack of discourse foci, as in Sidner's original theory.",
        "The claim that different parts of the attentional state are accessed when resolving pronouns and definite descriptions is supported, broadly speaking, by psycholinguistic research (see, e.g., (Garrod, 1993)).",
        "The main claims of centering theory are also consistent with psycholinguistic results (Hudson, 1988; Gordon et al., 1993).",
        "To our knowledge, however, the choice of a stack of focus spaces over a stack of discourse foci has never been motivated; yet this decision plays a crucial role in our problem, as we will see.",
        "A point worth keeping in mind throughout the following discussion is that, although the concept of CB (centering theory's name for the current most salient entity) was originally introduced as 'roughly corresponding to Sidner's concept of discourse fo-cus', in fact it is not clear that the two concepts are capturing the same intuitions (Poesio and Stevenson, 1998).",
        "Although it is often the case that the CB and the discourse focus coincide, this is not true in general.'",
        "For the purposes of this paper, however, we will assume that the two notions do coincide, and will use the neutral term MOST SALIENT ENTITY (1vISE) to refer to the discourse focus / CB of a particular segment of text.",
        "This intuitive impression was confirmed by a recent study (Giouli.",
        "1996).",

        "Because G&S's theory of the attentional state already hypothesises global focus structures in addition to the local attentional structures assumed in centering theory, the simplest explanation for our cases of long-distance pronominalisation is to hypothesise that readers exploit the global focus to resolve pronouns in such cases.",
        "Assuming that the global focus is involved in these cases, instead of complicating the local focus/centering theory, is consistent with the little available psychological evidence – e.g., with the results of Clark and Sengul (1979), who observed a slowdown in reading times for the sentence containing the pronoun when the antecedent is not in the same or the previous sentence, implying that long-distance pronominal anaphora are handled differently.",
        "Furthermore, suggesting that these pronouns are resolved by accessing the global focus would not really amount to a revision of the basic assumptions of G&S's theory.",

        "Under the assumptions about the discourse structure of examples like (1) just discussed, this explanation would indeed account for that example; there is evidence, however, that additional constraints are involved.",
        "The first bit of evidence is that the presence on the focus space stack of an appropriate antecedent does not always make the use of a long distance pronoun felicitous.",

        "Assuming that there is more than one segment in such texts, instead, will turn out to be not just a more plausible assumption about segmentation: it will also give us a simple way to explain the data.",
        "The use of he in the last sentence is awkward, even though there is a discourse entity on the focus space stack – the husband – that would satisfy the constraints imposed by the pronoun.",
        "This seems to indicate that the elements of a focus space are not all equally accessible.",
        "The second relevant bit of evidence concerns the use of proper names in the ILEX corpus.",
        "It may happen in the ILEX dialogues that a designer like Jessie King is first mentioned by name in a segment where she is not the main topic of discussion, as in Other jewels in the Bohemian style include a brooch by Jessie King.",
        "If this is the case, then when later we're talking about another jewel that King designed, she will have to be introduced again with a full proper name, Jessie King, rather than simply King.",
        "If, however, she becomes the 'main topic' of discussion, then later, whenever we talk about her again, we can use reduced forms of her proper name, such as King.",
        "Again, this difference is not easy to explain in terms of focus spaces if we assume that all objects in a focus space have the same status.",
        "A third class of expressions providing evidence relevant to this discussion are bridging descriptions, i.e., definite descriptions like the door that refer to an object associated with a previously mentioned discourse entity such as the house, rather than to the entity itself (Clark, 1977).",
        "Poesio et al.",
        "(1997; 1998) report experiments in which different types of lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridging descriptions and other cases of definite descriptions that require more than simple string match for their resolution.",
        "Their results indicate that to resolve bridging descriptions it is not sufficient simply to find which of the entities in the current focus",
        "space is semantically closest to the bridging description: in about half of the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved on the basis of the lexical knowledge used in these experiments, the focus spaces contained an entity whose description was more closely related to that of the bridging description than the one of the actual antecedent(s).",
        "This evidence about infelicitous pronouns, proper names, and bridging descriptions suggests that the entities in a focus space are not all equally salient.",
        "In fact, one could even wonder if we need focus spaces at all; i.e., if Sidner's original proposal - according to which it's just the MSE that goes on the stack, not the whole focus space - is correct.",
        "A revision of G&S's theory along these lines – i.e., in which the focus space stack is replaced by an MSE stack – would still explain (1), since the jeweller is clearly the MSE of sentence 3; indeed, all 7 cases of long-distance pronouns found in the ILEX corpus have a previous MSE as their antecedent.",
        "But, in addition, this revision would explain the awkwardness of (4): the husband was never an MSE, SO it would not be on the stack.",
        "A global focus of this type would also give us a way to formulate a restriction on using shortened forms of proper names that would account for the facts observed in the ILEX corpus: reduced NPs are allowed for entities that have been introduced as MSES, full NPS are needed otherwise.",
        "And finally, keeping track of previous MSES seems essential for bridging descriptions as well: in order to find the reasons for the low performance of algorithms for resolving bridging descriptions entirely based on lexical knowledge, (Poesio et al., 1998) examined the bridging descriptions their corpus to find out their 'preferred' antecedent.",
        "They found that the preferred antecedent of a bridging description is a previous MSE in 54 out of 203 cases.",
        "In the SOLE corpus, 8 out of 11 bridging descriptions relate to the MSE.",
        "Does this mean, then, that we can get rid of focus spaces, and assume that it's ivIsEs that go on the stack?",
        "Before looking at the data, we have to be clear as to what would count as evidence one way or the other.",
        "Even an approach in which only previous mSES are on the stack would still allow access to entities which are part of what Grosz called the IMPLICIT FOCUS of these MSES, i.e., the entities that As discussed in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), in general there is more than one potential 'antecedent' for a bridging description in a text.",
        "are 'strongly associated' with the MSES.",
        "This notion of 'strong association' is difficult to define – in fact, it is likely to be a matter of degree – but nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the objects 'strongly associated' with a discourse entity A do not include every discourse entity B which is part of a situation described in the text in which A is also involved; and this can be tested with linguistic examples, up to a point.",
        "For example, whereas definite descriptions like the radiator cap can easily be resolved in a null context to a car, descriptions like the dog can't, as shown by the infelicity of (5d) as a continuation of (5b), even though dogs in cars are not uncommon; some contextual antecedent is needed.",

        "d. The dog was enjoying the warmth.",
        "The question we have to answer, then, is whether the only information that is available as part of the attentional state is what is 'strongly associated' with one of the previous MSES, or, instead, all of the information mentioned in the text.7 Now, sentences like (5a) license both bridging descriptions to the car, as in (5c), and to Mary, as in Her hat had become very hot.",
        "Whatever we take the MSE of (5a) to be, it seems implausible to argue that both the bridging descriptions the radiator cap and Her hat are resolved by looking at the objects 'strongly associated' with that discourse entity.",
        "It is much simpler to assume that both Mary and the car are still accessible as part of the focus space constructed to represent the situation described by the text.",
        "This also holds for what we have called 'generic' pronouns, as shown by (3), in which they refers to individuals associated with the hotel mentioned in the first sentence, not to the MSE, John.",
        "And indeed, Sidner assumed two stacks – one of discourse foci, the other of actor foci.",
        "But even this extension would not be enough, because the antecedent of a bridging description is not always an entity explicitly introduced in the text, but can also be a more abstract DISCOURSE TOPIC, by which we",

        "In a corpus analysis done in connection with (Poesio et al., 1997; Poesio et al., 1998), we found that 7 out of 70 inferential descriptions were of this type; in the SOLE corpus, in which 3 out of 11 bridging descriptions behave this way.",
