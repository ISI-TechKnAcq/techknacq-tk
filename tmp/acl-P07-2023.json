        "A reliable corpus is very important for the opinion information processing because the annotations of opinions concern human perspectives.",

        "As mentioned, each sentence in our opinion corpus is annotated by three annotators.",
        "Although this is a must for building reliable annotations, the inconsistency is unavoidable.",
        "In this section, all the possible combinations of annotations are listed and two methods are introduced to evaluate the quality of the human-tagged opinion corpora.",
        "Three major properties are annotated for sentences in this corpus, i.e., the relevancy, the opinionated issue, and the holder of the opinion.",
        "The combinations of relevancy annotations are simple, and annotators usually have no argument over the opinion holders.",
        "However, for the annotation of the opinionated issue, the situation is more complex.",
        "Annotations may have an argument about whether a sentence contains opinions, and their annotations may not be consistent on the polarities of an opinion.",
        "Here we focus on the annotations of the opinionated issue.",
        "Sentences may be considered as opinions only when more than two annotators mark them opinionated.",
        "Therefore, they are targets for analysis.",
        "The possible combinations of opinionated sentences and their polarity are shown in Figure 1.",
        "In Figure 1, Cases A, B, C are those sentences which are annotated as opinionated by all three annotators, while cases D, E are those sentences which are annotated as opinionated only by two annotators.",
        "In case A and case D, the polarities annotated by annotators are identical.",
        "In case B, the polarities annotated by two of three annotators are agreed.",
        "However, in cases C and E, the polarities annotated disagree with each other.",
        "The statistics of these five cases are shown in Table 2.",
        "Multiple annotators bring the inconsistency.",
        "There are several kinds of inconsistency in annotations, for example, relevant/non-relevant, opinionated/non-opinionated, and the inconsistency of polarities.",
        "The relevant/non-relevant inconsistency is more like an information retrieval issue.",
        "For opinions, because their strength varies, sometimes it is hard for annotators to tell if a sentence is opinionated.",
        "However, for the opinion polarities, the inconsistency between positive and negative annotations is obviously stronger than that between positive and neutral, or neutral and negative ones.",
        "Here we define a sentence \"strongly inconsistent\" if both positive and negative polarities are assigned to a sentence by different annotators.",
        "The strong inconsistency may occur in case B (171), C (124), and E (270).",
        "In the corpus, only about 8% sentences are strongly inconsistent, which shows the annotations are reliable.",
        "We further assess the usability of the annotated corpus by Kappa values.",
        "Kappa value gives a quantitative measure of the magnitude of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Table 3 shows a commonly used scale of the Kappa values.",
        "The inconsistency of annotations brings difficulties in generating the gold standard.",
        "Sentences should first be selected as the testing collection, and then the corresponding gold standard can be generated.",
        "Our aim is to generate testing collections and their gold standards which agree mostly to annotators.",

        "For example, for the experiments of extracting opinion sentences, sentences in cases A, B, and C in Figure 1 are selected in both strict and lenient testing collections, while sentences in cases D and E are selected only in the lenient testing collection because three annotations are not totally agreed with one another.",
        "For the experiments of opinion polarity judgment, sentences in case A in Figure 1 are selected in both strict and lenient testing collections, while sentences in cases B, C, D and E are selected only in the lenient testing collection.",

        "However, one topic has only the relevant type document, it results in a total of 63 (2*31+1) groups of documents.",
        "Note that the lenient metric is applied for generating the gold standard of this testing collection because the strict metric needs perfect agreement with each annotator's annotations.",
        "The distribution of kappa values of 63 groups is shown in Table 4 and Table 5.",
        "The cumulative frequency bar graphs of Table 4 and Table 5 are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.",
        "According to Figure 2 and Figure 3, document groups with kappa values above 0.4 are selected as the high agreement testing collection, that is, document groups with moderate agreement in Table 3.",
        "A total of 48 document groups are collected for opinion extraction and 47 document groups are collected for opinion polarity judgment.",
        "In Section 3.2, sentences which are \"strongly inconsistent\" are defined.",
