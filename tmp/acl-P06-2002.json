        "An interesting approach is that of rote extractors (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), which look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relationship between two concepts.",
        "In this paper, we describe some contributions to the training of Rote extractors, including a procedure for generalizing the patterns, and a more complex way of calculating their accuracy.",
        "We first introduce the general structure of a rote extractor and its limitations.",

        "We have identified the following limitations in this algorithm: firstly, to our knowledge, no Rote extractor allows for the insertion of wildcards (e.g. *) in the extracted patterns.",
        "Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) have noted that this might be dangerous if the wildcard matches unrestrictedly incorrect sentences.",
        "However, we believe that the precision estimation that is performed at the last step of the algorithm, using the hook corpus, may be used to rule out the dangerous wildcards while keeping the useful ones.",
        "Secondly, we believe that the procedure for calculating the precision of the patterns may be somewhat unreliable in a few cases.",
        "For instance, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) report the following patterns for the relationships Inventor, Discoverer and Location:",
        "In this case, it can be seen that the same pattern (the genitive construction) may be used to indicate several different relationships, apart from the most common use indicating possession.",

        "Let us suppose that we obtain the pattern for Location using the pairs (New York, Chrysler Building).",
        "The genitive construction can be extracted from the context New York’s Chrysler Building.",
        "Afterward, when evaluating it, only sentences containing <target>’s Chrysler Building are taken into account, which makes it unlikely that the pattern is expressing a relationship other than Location, so the pattern will receive a high precision value.",
        "For our purposes, however, we need to collect patterns for several relations such as writer-book, painter -picture, director - lm, actor - lm, and we want to make sure that the obtained patterns are only applicable to the desired relationship.",
        "Patterns like <target> ’s <hook> are very likely to be applicable to all of these relationships at the same time, so we would like to be able to discard them automatically.",
        "Hence, we propose the following improvements for a Rote extractor:",
        "• A new pattern generalization procedure that allows the inclusion of wildcards in the patterns.",
        "• The combination with Named Entity recognition, so people, locations, organizations and dates are replaced by their entity type in the patterns, in order to increase their degree of generality.",

        "The procedure is detailed in the following subsections.",
        "2.1 Context extraction procedure After selecting the sentences for each pair of related words in the training set, these are processed with a part-of-speech tagger and a module for Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) that annotates people, organizations, locations, dates, relative temporal expressions and numbers.",
        "Afterward, a context around the two words in the pair is extracted, including (a) at most five words to the left of the first word; (b) all the words in between the pair words; (c) at most five words to the right of the second word.",
        "The context never jumps over sentence boundaries, which are marked with the symbols BOS (Beginning of sentence) and EOS (End of sentence).",
        "The two related concepts are marked as <hook> and <target>.",
        "Figure 1 shows several example contexts extracted for the relationships birth year, birthplace, writer-book and capital-country.",
        "Furthermore, for each of the entities in the relationship, the system also stores in a separate file the way in which they are annotated in the training corpus: the sequences of part-of-speech tags of every appearance, and the entity type (if marked as such).",
        "So, for instance, typical PoS sequences for names of authors are “NNP”1 (surname) and “NNP NNP” (first name and surname).",
