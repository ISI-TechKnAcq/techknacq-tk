        "Empirically investigating what data children attend to during syntactic acquisition is a difficult task.",
        "Traditional experimental methods are not feasible on logistical and ethical grounds – we can’t simply lock a group of children in a room for two years, restrict their input to whatever we want, and then see if their syntactic acquisition matches normal patterns.",
        "However, when we have a simulated group of language learners who follow a quantified model of individual acquisition, this is exactly what we can do – restrict the input to syntactic acquisition in a very specific way and then observe the results.",
        "The individual acquisition model we use is inspired by Yang’s (2003, 2000) model of probabilistic learning for multiple grammars.",
        "By using this model in a simulated population of individuals, we provide empirical support for two acquisition proposals that restrict children to only heed data that are unambiguous triggers (Dresher 1999, Lightfoot 1999, Fodor 1998) and that appear in degree-0 clauses (Lightfoot 1991).",
        "We use language change as a metric of “correct” acquisition, based on the following idea: if the simulated population that has these restrictions behaves just as the real population historically did, the simulated acquisition process is fairly similar to the real acquisition process.",
        "Language change is an excellent yardstick for acquisition proposals for exactly this reason – any theory of acquisition must not only be able to account for how children converge to a close approximation of the adult grammar, but also how they can “misconverge” slightly and allow specific types of grammatical change over time.",
        "The nature of this “misconvergence” is key.",
        "Children must end up with an Internal Language (“grammar”) that is close enough - but not too close - to the Observable Language (O-Language) in the population so that change can happen at the right pace.",
        "The language change we use as our metric is the shift in Old English from a strongly Object-Verb (OV) distribution to a strongly Verb-Object (VO) distribution between 1000 and 1200 A.D.",
        "The sharpest part of this shift occurs between 1150 and 1200 A.D., based on data from the YCOE Corpus (Taylor et al.",
        "2003) and the PPCME2 Corpus (Kroch & Taylor 2000).",
        "We use this corpus data to estimate the initial OV/VO distribution in the modeled population at 1000 A.D. and to calibrate the modeled population’s projected OV/VO distribution between 1000 and 1150 A.D. Then, we demonstrate that the restrictions on acquisition seem both sufficient and surprisingly necessary for the simulated Old English population to shift its distribution to be strongly VO by 1200 A.D – and thus match the historical facts of Old English.",
        "In this way, we provide empirical support that we would be hard-pressed to get using traditional methods for these acquisition proposals.",
        "The rest of the paper is laid out as follows: section 2 elaborates on the two acquisition proposals of unambiguous triggers and degree-0 data; section 3 gives specific implementations of these proposals for Old English; section 4 describes the model used to simulate the population of Old English speakers and how the historical corpus data was used; sections 5 and 6 present the results and conclusion."

      "text": [
        "The first proposal is set in a Principles and Parameters framework (Chomsky 1981) where the adult grammar consists of a specific set of parameter values and the process of acquisition is figuring out what those values are.",
        "An unambiguous trigger (Fodor 1998, Dresher 1999, Lightfoot 1999) is a piece of data from the O-language that unambiguously signals one parameter value over another for a given parameter.",
        "Crucially, an unambiguous trigger for value P1 of parameter P can be parsed only with value P1 (and not P2), no matter what other parameter values (A, B, C, É) might also be affecting the O-language form of the data.",
        "Because an unambiguous trigger corresponds to exactly one parameter P and thus can alter the value of P only, this proposal would allow children to bypass the Credit Problem noted by Dresher (1999), which is the problem of deciding which parameters to update given a particular piece of input.",
        "In addition, unambiguous triggers allow the learner to bypass the combinatoric explosion problem that could occur when trying to set n parameters.",
        "Instead of having to test out 2n different grammars on the input in the O-languages, the child’s language acquisition mechanism simply tests out the n parameters separately by looking for unambiguous triggers for these n parameters in the input from the O-language.",
        "Thus, this proposal aids the process of acquiring the adult grammar quickly and correctly.",
        "A potential pitfall of this proposal is data sparseness: the quantity of data that fits this very specific restriction might be very small for a parameter P and the child just might not see enough of it for it to have an effect1.",
        "The second proposal is that children only heed data in degree-0 clauses (Lightfoot 1991) when they first begin to set their syntactic parameter values.",
        "“Degree” refers to the level of embedding, so a degree 0 clause corresponds to a main clause2.",
        "The basis for this proposal is that while local grammatical relationships (such as those in degree0 clauses) provide a lot of information to the learner, degree-0 data tends to be “messier” grammatically – that is, more grammatical processes seem to apply to degree-0 clauses than to degree-1 clauses.",
        "The messier status of this data allows the child to converge to a grammar that is not exactly the same as the adult grammar.",
        "Thus, this proposal focuses on how to allow small grammatical changes to occur in individuals so that larger changes can happen to the population over time.",
        "The cost of combining this proposal with the previous one is that the child is now restricted to learn only from degree-0 unambiguous triggers, thereby compounding the potential data sparseness problem that unambiguous triggers already have.",
        "In fact, it may well be necessary to restrict the set of parameters relevant for determining if a trigger is unambiguous to some initial pool in order to get any unambiguous triggers at all.",
        "A candidate set for the initial pool of parameters might be derived from a hierarchy of parameters along the lines of the one based on cross linguistic comparison that is described in Baker (2001, 2005).",
        "The exact domain of a degree-0 clause is defined as the main clause and the front of the embedded clause for theory-internal reasons.",

        "Allowing language change to occur as it historically did is a mark of “correct” acquisition, especially for change involving syntactic parameters that can only be altered during acquisition - any change that builds up in the population must be due to changes that occur during acquisition.",

        "In this work, we explore the possibility that the data children are heeding during acquisition are the degree-0 unambiguous triggers.",

        "In addition to this correct “surface order” in the O -language, an unambiguous trigger must also have an unambiguous derivation to produce this surface order.",
        "This means that no other combination of parameters with the alternate word order value could produce the observed surface order.",
        "For example, a Subject Verb Object utterance could be produced more than one way because of the Verb-Second (V2) movement parameter which was also available in Old English (as in modern Dutch and German).",

        "Thus, correct surface order alone does not suffice – only an utterance with the correct surface order and that cannot be generated with the competing word order value is an unambiguous trigger3.",
        "Because V2 movement (among other kinds of movement) can move the Verb away from the Object, Verb-Markers can be used to determine the original position of the Verb with respect to the Object.",
        "Verb-Markers include particles (‘up’), non-finite complements to finite verbs (‘shall...perform’), some closed-class adverbials (‘never’), and negatives (‘not’) as described in Lightfoot (1991).",
        "The curious fact about Old English Verb-Markers (unlike their modern Dutch and German counterparts) is that they were unreliable – often they moved away from the Object as well, leaving nothing Verb-like adjacent to the Object.",
        "This turned utterances which potentially were unambiguous triggers for either OV or VO order into ambiguous utterances which could not help acquisition.",
        "We term this “trigger destruction,” and it has the effect of making the distribution of OV and VO utterances that the child uses during 3 We note that this could potentially be very resource-intensive to determine since all other interfering parameter values (such as V2) must be taken into account.",

        "It is this difference that “biases” children away from the distribution in the population and it is this difference that will cause small grammatical changes to accumulate in the population until the larger change emerges – the shift from being strongly OV to being strongly VO.",
        "Thus, the question of what data children heed during acquisition has found a very suitable testing ground in Old English."

        "The acquisition model in this work is founded on several ideas previously explored in the acquisition modeling and language change literature.",
        "First, grammars with opposing parameter values (such as OV and VO order) compete with each other both during acquisition (Clack & Robert 1993) and within a population over time (Pintzuk 2002, among others).",
        "Second, population-level change is the result of a build-up of individual-level “misconvergences” (Niyogi & Berwick, 1997, 1996, 1995).",
        "Third, individual linguistic behavior can be represented as a probabilistic distribution of multiple grammars.",
        "This is the result of multiple grammars competing during acquisition and still existing after acquisition.",
        "Multiple grammars in an individual are instantiated as that individual accessing g grammars with probability pg each (Yang 2003).",
        "In our simulation, there are two grammars (g = 2) – one with the OV/VO order set to OV and one with the OV/VO order set to VO.",
        "In a stable system with g=1, g1 has probability pg1 = 1 of being accessed and all unambiguous triggers come from this grammar.",
        "In the unstable system for our language change, g=2 and g1 is accessed with probability pg1 while g2 is accessed with probability pg2 = 1 – pgl.",
        "Both grammars leave unambiguous triggers in the input to the child.",
        "If the quantity of unambiguous triggers from each grammar is approximately equal, these quantities will effectively cancel each other out (whatever quantity pulls the child towards OV will be counterbalanced by the quantity of triggers pulling the child towards VO).",
        "Therefore, the",
        "crucial quantity is how many more unambiguous triggers one grammar has than the other, since this is the quantity that will not be cancelled out.",
        "This is the advantage a grammar has over another in the input.",
        "Table 1 shows the advantage in the degree-0 (D0) clauses and degree-1 (D1) clauses that the OV grammar has over the VO grammar in Old English at various points in time, based on the data from the YCOE (Taylor et al.",
        "2003) and PPCME2 (Kroch & Taylor 2000) corpora.",
        "The corpus data shows a 1.6% advantage for the OV grammar in the D0 clauses at 1000 A.D. – which means that only 16 out of every 1000 sentences in the input are actually doing any work for acquisition (and more specifically, pulling the child towards the OV grammar).",
        "The data also show that the D1 advantage is much stronger.",
        "However, this does not help our learners for two reasons: a) Based on samples of modern children’s input (4K from CHILDES (MacWhinney & Snow 1985) and 4K from young children’s stories (for details on this data, see Pearl (2005)), D1 clauses only make up ~16% of modern English children’s input.",
        "If we assume that the quantity of D1 input to children is approximately the same no matter what time period they live in5, then our Old English children also heard D1 data in their input ~16% of the time.",
        "b) Our learners can only use D0 data, anyway.",
        "This leads to two questions for the restrictions imposed by the acquisition proposals - a question of sufficiency and a question of necessity.",

        "5 At this point in time, we are unaware of any studies that suggest that the composition of motherese, for example, has altered significantly over time.",
        "we can simply ask if these restrictions on the data children heed are sufficient to allow the Old English population to shift from OV to VO at the appropriate time.",
        "Then, supposing that they are, we can ask if these restrictions are necessary to get the job done – that is, will the population shift correctly even if these restrictions do not hold?",
        "We can relax both the restriction to learn only from unambiguous triggers and the restriction to learn only from degree-0 clause data – and then see if the population can still shift to a strongly VO distribution on time."

        "The acquisition model itself is based around the idea of probabilistic access function of binary parameter values (Bock & Kroch 1989) in an individual.",
        "For example, if an individual has a function that accesses the VO order value 30% of the time, the utterances generated by that individual would be VO order 30% of the time and OV order 70% of the time.",
        "Note that this is the distribution before other parameters such as V2 movement alter the order, so the O-language distribution produced by this speaker is not 30-70.",
        "However, the O-language distribution will still have some unambiguous OV triggers and some unambiguous VO triggers, so a child hearing data from this speaker will have to deal with the conflicting values.",

        "The VO access value ranges from 0.0 (all OV access) to 1.0 (all VO access).",
        "A value of 0.3, for example, would correspond to accessing VO order 30% of the time.",
        "A child begins with this value at 0.5, so there is a 50% chance of accessing either OV or VO order.",
        "Two mechanisms help summarize the data the child has seen so far without using up computing resources: the Noise Filter and a modified Batch Learner Method (Yang 2003).",

        "Both mechanisms rely on the probabilistic value of VO access to reflect the distribution of triggers seen so far.",

        "As well, we hope to test the degree-0 unambiguous trigger restriction for other parameters with documented language change, such as the loss of V2 movement in Middle English (Yang 2003, Lightfoot 1999, among others).",
        "This type of language change modeling",
        "may also be useful for testing proposals about what the crucial data is for phonological acquisition."
