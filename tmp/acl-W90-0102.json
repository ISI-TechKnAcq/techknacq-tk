        "Tree-adjoining grammars (TAG) have been proposed as a formalism for generation based on the intuition that the extended domain of syntactic locality that TAGs provide should aid in localizing semantic dependencies as well, in turn serving as an aid to generation from semantic representations.",
        "We demonstrate that this intuition can be made concrete by using the formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars.",
        "The use of synchronous TAGs for generation provides solutions to several problems with previous approaches to TAG generation.",
        "Furthermore, the semantic monotonicity requirement previously advocated for generation grammars as a computational aid is seen to be an inherent property of synchronous TAGs."

        "Shieber (1988) defines a notion of semantic monotonicity, a kind of compositionality property that guarantees that it can be locally determined whether phrases can contribute to forming an expression with a given meaning.",
        "Generation schemes that reorder top-down generation (Dymetman and Isabelle, 1988; Strzalkowski, 1989) so as to make available information that well-founds the top-down recursion also fall into the mold of localizing semantic information.",

        "structure of their TAG analysis.2 A synchronous TAG sufficient for this example includes the three pairings of trees (labeled a, flu, and (32) found in Figure 1.",

        "and perform the two operations, one in each of the trees.",

        "Translation with Synchronous TAGs Synchronous TAGs as informally described here declaratively characterize a relation over strings in two languages without priority of one of the languages over the other.",
        "Any method for computing this relation in one direction will perforce be applicable to the other direction as well.",
        "The distinction between parsing and generation is a purely informal one depending merely on which side of the relation one chooses to compute from; both are instances of a process of translating between two TAG languages appropriately synchronized.",
        "The question of generation with synchronous TAGs reverts then to one of whether this relation can be computed in general.",
        "There are many issues involved in answering this question, most importantly, what the underlying TAG formalism (the base formalism) is that the two linked TAGs are stated in.",
        "The simple example above required a particularly simple base formalism, namely pure TAGs with adjunction as the only operation.",
        "The experience of grammar writers has demonstrated that substitution is a necessary operation to be added to the formalism, and that a limited form of feature structures with equations are helpful as well.",
        "Work on the use of synchronous TAGs to capture quantifier scoping possibilities makes use of so-called multicomponent TAGs.",
        "Finally, the base TAGs may be lexicalized (Schabes et al., 1988) or not.",
        "Once the base formalism has been decided upon (we currently are using lexicalized multicomponent TAGs with substitution and adjunction), a simple translation strategy from a source string to a target is to parse the string using an appropriate TAG parser for the base formalism.",
        "Each derivation of the source string can be mapped according to the synchronizing links in the grammar to a target derivation.",
        "Such a target derivation defines a string in the target language which is a translate of the source string.",
        "In the case of generation, the source string is a semantic representation, the target is a natural-language realization.",
        "For example, the logical form (2) has a single derivation in the pure TAG formed by projecting the synchronous TAG onto its semantic component.",
        "(We might notate the semantic components with a(sem), #1(sem), and fl2(sem), and analogously for the syntactic components.)",
        "That derivation can be recovered by \"parsing\" the logical form with the projected logical form grammar, as depicted in Figure 3.",
        "The pairings whose semantic components were used in this derivation and the links operated on implicitly define a corresponding derivation on the syntactic side.",
        "The yield of this derivation is a string whose meaning is represented by the logical form that we started with.",
        "The target derivation might not, unlike in the example above, be in canonical form (as defined by VijayShanker (1988)), and consequently must be normalized to put it into canonical form.",
        "Under certain configurations of links, the normalization process is nonde",
        "terministic; thus one source derivation (necessarily in canonical form by virtue of properties of the parsing algorithm) may be associated with several canonical target derivations.",
        "In translation from natural language to logical forms, the multiple translates typically correspond to scope ambiguities in the source sentence (as quantifier scope or scope of negation or adverbs).",
        "On the other hand, we have not observed the linking configurations that give rise to such ambiguities in translating in the other direction, that is, in performing generation.",
        "In previous work, one of us noted that generation according to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be semantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived semantics for an expression must include, in an appropriate sense, the semantic material of all its sub constituents.",
        "It is interesting to note that synchronous TAGs are inherently semantically monotonic, and the computational advantages that accrue to such grammars apply to synchronous TAG generation as well.",
        "Furthermore, it is reasonable to require that the semantic component of a synchronous TAG be lexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.",
        "(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing according to the semantic grammar and, consequently, more efficient generation.",
        "In the case of augmented context-free grammars, the semantic monotonicity requirement precludes \"lexicalization\"",
        "of the semantics.",
        "It is not possible to require nontrivial semantics to be associated with each lexical item.",
        "This fact, and the inefficiencies of generation thatfollow from it, was the initial motivation for the move to semantic-head-driven generation (Shieber et at, forthcoming).",
        "The efficiencies that that algorith-mgains for augmented-context-free generation inhere in the synchronous TAG generation process if the semantic gramamr is lexicalized.",
        "In summary, just as lexicalization of the syntactic grammar aids parsing (Schabes and Joshi, 1989), so lexicalization of the semantic grammar aids generation.",
        "The simple generation algorithm that we have just presented seems to require that we completely analyze the logical form before generating the target string, as the process is a cascade of three subprocesses: parsing the logical form to a source derivation, mapping from source to target derivation, and computing the target derivation yield.",
        "As is common in such cases, portions of these computations can be interleaved, so that generation of the target string can proceed incrementally while traversing the source logical form.",
        "To what extent this incrementality can be achieved in practice depends on subtleties in the exact formal definition of synchronous TAG derivation and properties of particular grammars; a full explication is beyond the scope of this paper."
