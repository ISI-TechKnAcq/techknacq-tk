        "Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews.",
        "To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods.",
        "Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts.",
        "In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing.",
        "However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews.",
        "To fill this gap, this paper empirically studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus.",
        "We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not.",
        "In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size."

        "With the rapid development of Web 2.0, huge amount of user reviews are springing up on the Web.",
        "Mining opinions from these reviews become more and more urgent since that customers expect to obtain fine-grained information of products and manufacturers need to obtain immediate feedbacks from customers.",
        "In opinion mining, extracting opinion targets is a basic subtask.",
        "It is to extract a list of the objects which users express their opinions on and can provide the prior information of targets for opinion mining.",
        "So this task has attracted many attentions.",
        "To extract opinion targets, pervious approaches usually relied on opinion words which are the words used to express the opinions (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Wang and Wang, 2008; Qiu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "Intuitively, opinion words often appear around and modify opinion targets, and there are opinion relations and associations between them.",
        "If we have known some words to be opinion words, the words which those opinion words modify will have high probability to be opinion targets.",
        "Therefore, identifying the aforementioned opinion relations between words is important for extracting opinion targets from reviews.",
        "To fulfill this aim, previous methods exploited the words co-occurrence information to indicate them (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Hu and Liu, 2004b).",
        "Obviously, these methods cannot obtain precise extraction because of the diverse expressions by reviewers, like long-span modified relations between words, etc.",
        "To handle this problem, several methods exploited syntactic information, where several heuristic patterns based on syntactic parsing were designed (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).",
        "However, the sentences in online reviews usually have informal writing styles including grammar mistakes, typos, improper punctuation etc., which make parsing prone to generate mistakes.",
        "As a result, the syntax-based methods which heavily depended on the parsing performance would suffer from parsing errors (Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "To improve the extraction performance, we can only employ some exquisite high-precision patterns.",
        "But this strategy is likely to miss many opinion targets and has lower recall with the increase of corpus size.",
        "To resolve these problems, Liu et al. (2012) formulated identifying opinion relations between words as an monolingual alignment process.",
        "A word can find its corresponding modifiers by using a word alignment",
        "the noises from parsing errors can be effectively avoided.",
        "Nevertheless, we notice that the alignment model is a statistical model which needs sufficient data to estimate parameters.",
        "When the data is insufficient, it would suffer from data sparseness and may make the performance decline.",
        "Thus, from the above analysis, we can observe that the size of the corpus has impacts on these two kinds of methods, which arises some important questions: how can we make selection between syntax based methods and alignment based method for opinion target extraction when given a certain amount of reviews?",
        "And which kind of methods can obtain better extraction performance with the variation of the size of the dataset?",
        "Although (Liu et al., 2012) had proved the effectiveness of WAM, they mainly performed experiments on the dataset with medium size.",
        "We are still curious about that when the size of dataset is larger or smaller, can we obtain the same conclusion?",
        "To our best knowledge, these problems have not been studied before.",
        "Moreover, opinions may be expressed in different ways with the variation of the domain and language of the corpus.",
        "When the domain or language of the corpus is changed, what conclusions can we obtain?",
        "To answer these questions, in this paper, we adopt a unified framework to extract opinion targets from reviews, in the key component of which we vary the methods between syntactic patterns and alignment model.",
        "Then we run the whole framework on the corpus with different size (from #500 to #1, 000, 000), domain (three domains) and language (Chinese and English) to empirically assess the performance variations and discuss which method is more effective.",
        "Furthermore, this paper naturally addresses another question: is it useful for opinion targets extraction when we combine syntactic patterns and word alignment model into a unified model?",
        "To this end, we employ a partially supervised alignment model (PSWAM) like (Gao et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "Based on the exquisitely designed high-precision syntactic patterns, we can obtain some precisely modified relations between words in sentences, which provide a portion of links of the full alignments.",
        "Then, these partial alignment links can be regarded as the constrains for a standard unsupervised word alignment model.",
        "And each target candidate would find its modifier under the partial supervision.",
        "In this way, the errors generated in standard unsupervised WAM can be corrected.",
        "For example in Figure 1, ?kindly?",
        "and ?courteous?",
        "are incorrectly regarded as the modifiers for ?foods?",
        "if the WAM is performed in an whole unsupervised framework.",
        "However, by using some high-precision syntactic patterns, we can assert ?courteous?",
        "should be aligned to ?services?, and ?delicious?",
        "should be aligned to ?foods?.",
        "Through combination under partial supervision, we can see ?kindly?",
        "and ?courteous?",
        "are correctly linked to ?services?.",
        "Thus, it's reasonable to expect to yield better performance than traditional methods.",
        "As mentioned in (Liu et al., 2013), using PSWAM can not only inherit the advantages of WAM: effectively avoiding noises from syntactic parsing errors when dealing with informal texts, but also can improve the mining performance by using partial supervision.",
        "However, is this kind of combination always useful for opinion target extraction?",
        "To access this problem, we also make comparison between PSWAM based method and the aforementioned methods in the same corpora with different size, language and domain.",
        "The experimental results show the combination by using PSWAM can be effective on dataset with small and medium size."

        "Opinion target extraction isn't a new task for opinion mining.",
        "There are much work focusing on this task, such as (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Ding et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Wu et al., 2009).",
        "Totally, previous studies can be divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised methods.",
        "In supervised approaches, the opinion target extraction task was usually regarded as a sequence labeling problem (Jin and Huang, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Ma and Wan, 2010; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009).",
        "It's not only to extract a lexicon or list of opinion targets, but also to find out each opinion target mentions in reviews.",
        "Thus, the contextual words are usually selected as the features to indicate opinion targets in sentences.",
        "And classical sequence labeling models are used to train the extractor, such as CRFs (Li et al., 2010), HMM (Jin and Huang, 2009) etc.. Jin et al. (2009) proposed a lexicalized HMM model to perform opinion mining.",
        "Both Li et al. (2010) and Ma et al. (2010) used CRFs model to extract opinion targets in reviews.",
        "Specially, Li et al. proposed a Skip-Tree CRF model for opinion target extraction, which exploited three structures including linear-chain structure, syntactic structure, and conjunction structure.",
        "However, the main limitation of these supervised methods is the need of labeled training data.",
        "If the labeled training data is insufficient, the trained model would have unsatisfied extraction performance.",
        "Labeling sufficient training data is time and labor consuming.",
        "And for different domains, we need label data independently, which is obviously impracticable.",
        "Thus, many researches focused on unsupervised methods, which are mainly to extract a list of opinion targets from reviews.",
        "Similar to ours, most approaches regarded opinion words as the indicator for opinion targets.",
        "(Hu and Liu, 2004a) regarded the nearest adjective to an noun/noun phrase as its modifier.",
        "Then it exploited an association rule mining algorithm to mine the associations between them.",
        "Finally, the frequent explicit product features can be extracted in a bootstrapping process by further combining item's frequency in dataset.",
        "Only using nearest neighbor rule to mine the modifier for each candidate cannot obtain precise results.",
        "Thus, (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) used syntax information to extract opinion targets, which designed some syntactic patterns to capture the modified relations between words.",
        "The experimental results showed that their method had better performance than (Hu and Liu, 2004a).",
        "Moreover, (Qiu et al., 2011) proposed a Double Propagation method to expand sentiment words and opinion targets iteratively, where they also exploited syntactic relations between words.",
        "Specially, (Qiu et al., 2011) didn't only design syntactic patterns for capturing modified relations, but also designed patterns for capturing relations among opinion targets and relations among opinion words.",
        "However, the main limitation of Qiu's method is that the patterns based on dependency parsing tree may miss many targets for the large corpora.",
        "Therefore, Zhang et al. (2010) extended Qiu's method.",
        "Besides the patterns used in Qiu's method, they adopted some other special designed patterns to increase recall.",
        "In addition they used the HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) algorithm to compute opinion target confidences to improve the precision.",
        "(Liu et al., 2012) formulated identifying opinion relations between words as an alignment process.",
        "They used a completely unsupervised WAM to capture opinion relations in sentences.",
        "Then the opinion targets were extracted in a standard random walk framework where two factors were considered: opinion relevance and target importance.",
        "Their experimental results have shown that WAM was more effective than traditional syntax-based methods for this task.",
        "(Liu et al., 2013) extend Liu's method, which is similar to our method and also used a partially supervised alignment model to extract opinion targets from reviews.",
        "We notice these two methods ((Liu et al., 2012) and (Liu et al., 2013)) only performed experiments on the corpora with a medium size.",
        "Although both of them proved that WAM model is better than the methods based on syntactic patterns, they didn't discuss the performance variation when dealing with the corpora with different sizes, especially when the size of the corpus is less than 1,000 and more than 10,000.",
        "Based on their conclusions, we still don't know which kind of methods should be selected for opinion target extraction when given a certain amount of reviews."

        "3) We also observe that recall of Syntax is worse than other two methods.",
        "It's because the human expressions of opinions are diverse and the manual designed syntactic patterns are limited to capture all opinion relations in sentences, which may miss an amount of correct opinion targets.",
        "4) It's interesting that the performance gap between these three methods is smaller with the increase of the size of the corpus (more than 50,000).",
