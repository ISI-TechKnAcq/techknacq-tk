        "Of these, 300,000 words are taken from the Sports, Consumer Information and Culture/Entertainment domains of the 18 million word corpus (Ijaz et al.",
        "2007), 100,000 words are obtained from Urdu-Nepali-English Parallel Corpus (available at www.PANL10n.net), and another 100,000 words are taken from a previously POS tagged corpus (Sajjad, 2007; tags of this corpus are removed before further processing).",
        "This corpus is manually cleaned for word segmentation errors, by adding missing spaces between words and replacing spaces with Zero Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) within words.",
        "For the computation of word grams, the 18 million word corpus of Urdu is used (Ijaz et al.",

        "Some of these words occur with very high frequency in the corpus.",
        "For example \"iSjj\" (ho ga, \"will be\") exists as single word rather than two words due to missing space.",
        "To solve this space insertion problem, a list of about 700 words with frequency greater than 50 is obtained from the word unigrams.",
        "Each word of the list is manually reviewed and space is inserted, where required.",
