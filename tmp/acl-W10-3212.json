        "2007).",
        "The corpus used for building ligature grams consists of half a million words.",
        "Of these, 300,000 words are taken from the Sports, Consumer Information and Culture/Entertainment domains of the 18 million word corpus (Ijaz et al.",
        "2007), 100,000 words are obtained from Urdu-Nepali-English Parallel Corpus (available at www.PANL10n.net), and another 100,000 words are taken from a previously POS tagged corpus (Sajjad, 2007; tags of this corpus are removed before further processing).",
        "This corpus is manually cleaned for word segmentation errors, by adding missing spaces between words and replacing spaces with Zero Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) within words.",
        "For the computation of word grams, the 18 million word corpus of Urdu is used (Ijaz et al.",

        "In the 18 million word corpus, certain words are combined due to missing space, but are separate words.",
        "Some of these words occur with very high frequency in the corpus.",
        "For example \"iSjj\" (ho ga, \"will be\") exists as single word rather than two words due to missing space.",
        "To solve this space insertion problem, a list of about 700 words with frequency greater than 50 is obtained from the word unigrams.",
        "Each word of the list is manually reviewed and space is inserted, where required.",

        "If a node-string has only one word and this word does not occur in the dictionary as a valid word then it is checked that this word may occur at the start of any dictionary entry.",
        "In this case numeric value is also assigned.",
        "After assignment, nodes are ranked according to these values and best k (beam value) nodes are selected.",

        "Sentence identification errors depend heavily on the unknown words.",
