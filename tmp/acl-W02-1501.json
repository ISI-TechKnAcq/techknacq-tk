        "It is widely assumed that rich computational lexicons form a fundamental component of reliable parsing architectures and that lexical information can only have beneficial effects on parsing.",
        "Since the beginning of work on broad-coverage parsing (Jensen 1988a, 1988b), the key issue has been how to make effective use of lexical information.",
        "In this paper we put these assumptions to the test by addressing the following questions: to what extent should a lexicon be trusted for parsing?",
        "What is the neat contribution of lexical information to overall parse success?",
        "We present here the results of a preliminary evaluation of the interplay between lexical and grammatical information in parsing Italian using a robust parsing system based on an incremental approach to shallow syntactic analysis.",
        "The system can run in both a non-lexicalised and a lexicalised mode.",
        "Careful analysis of the results shows that contribution of lexical information to parse success is more selective than commonly assumed, thus raising the parallel issues of how to promote a more effective integration between parsers and lexicons and how to develop better lexicons for parsing."

        "Let us consider the output of BP first.",
        "The striking difference in the recall of noun-headed vs verb-headed prepositional attachments (on comparable levels of precision, rows 2 and 3 of Table 1) prompts the suggestion that the typical context of use of a noun is more easily described in terms of local, order-contingent criteria (e.g. rightmost attachment) than a verb context is.",
        "We can give at least three reasons for that.",
        "First, frame bearing nouns tend to select fewer arguments than verbs do.",
        "In our lexicon, 1693 verb-headed frames out of 6924 have more than one non subject argument (24.4%), while there being only 1950 noun-headed frames out of 15399 with more than one argument (12.6%).",
        "In TC, of 2300 head verb tokens, 328 exhibit more than one non subject argument (14%).",
        "Rightmost attachment trivially penalises such argument chains, where some arguments happen to be overtly realised in context one or more steps removed from their heads.",
        "The second reason is sensitive to language variation: verb arguments tend to be dislocated more easily than noun arguments, as dislocation heavily depends on sentence-level (hence main verb-level) phenomena such as shift of topic or emphasis.",
        "In Italian, topic-driven argument dislocation in preverbal position is comparatively frequent and represents a problem for the baseline parser, which works on a head-first assumption.",
        "Thirdly, verbs are typically modified by a wider set of syntactic satellites than nouns are, such as temporal and circumstantial modifiers (Dik 1989).",
        "For example, deverbal nouns do not inherit the possible temporal modifiers of their verb base (I run the marathon in three hours, but *the run of the marathon in three hours).",
        "Modifiers of this sort tend to be distributed in the sentence much more freely than ordinary arguments.",
        "Of the three above mentioned factors, only the first one has an obvious lexical character.",
        "We can provide a rough estimate of the impact of lexical information on the performance of LAP.",
        "The lexicon filter contributes a 9% increase of recall on verb complements (4% over 45.5%), by correctly reattaching to the verbal head those arguments (61) that were wrongly attached to their immediately preceding constituent by BP.",
        "This leads to an overall 49.5% recall.",
        "All remaining false negatives (about 48%) are i) either verb modifiers or ii) proper verb arguments lying out of the reach of structure-based criteria, due to syntactic phenomena such as complement dislocation, complex coordination, parenthetic constructions and ellipsis.",
        "We shall return to a more detailed analysis of false negatives in section 4.3.4.",
        "In the case of noun complements, use of lexical information produces a negligible increase of recall: 0.6% ( 0.5% over 80.8%).",
        "This is not surprising, as our test corpus contains very few cases of noun-headed argument chains, fewer than we could expect if the probability of their occurrence reflected the (uniform) type distribution of noun frames in the lexicon.",
        "The vast majority of noun-headed false negatives, as we shall see in more detail in a moment, is represented by modifiers.",
        "Reattachment is enforced by LAP when the preposition introducing a candidate complement in context is found in the lexical frame of its head.",
        "Table 2 shows that ~37% of the 103 restructured attachments proposed by the lexicon are wrong.",
        "Even more interestingly, there is a strong asymmetry between nouns and verbs.",
        "With verb heads, precision of lexically-driven reattachments is fairly high (~70%), nonetheless lower than precision of rightmost attachment (~75%).",
        "In the case of noun heads, the number of lexically reattached dependencies is instead extremely low.",
        "The percentage of mistakes is high, with precision dropping to 26.6%.",
        "The difference in the total number of restructured attachment may be again due to the richer complementation patterns exhibited by verbs in the lexicon.",
        "However, while in the case of verbs lexical information produces a significant improvement on restructured attachment precision, this contribution drops considerably for nouns.",
        "The main reason for this situation is that nouns tend to select semantically vacuous prepositions such as of much more often than verbs do.",
        "In our lexicon, out of 4157 frames headed by a noun, 4015 contain the preposition di as an argument introducer (96.6%).",
        "Di is in fact an extremely polysemous preposition, heading, among others, also possessive phrases and other kinds of modifiers.",
        "This trivially increases the number of cases of attachment ambiguity and eventually the possibility of getting false positives.",
        "Conversely, as shown by the number of confirmed attachments in Table 2, the role of lexical information in further specifying an attachment with no restructuring is almost uniform across nouns and verbs.",
        "The vast majority of undetected verb complements (80.6%) are modifiers of various kind.",
        "The remaining set of false negatives consists of 48 complements (7.7%), 30 indirect objects (4.8%) and 43 oblique arguments (6.9%).",
        "Most such complements are by-phrases in passive constructions which are not as such very difficult to detect but just happen to fall out of the current coverage of LAP.",
        "More interestingly, 2/3 of the remaining false negatives elude LAP because they are overtly realised far away from their verb head, often to its left.",
        "Most of these constructions involve argument dislocation and ellipsis.",
        "We can thus preliminarily conclude that argument dislocation and ellipsis accounts for about 14% of false negatives (7% over 50%).",
        "Finally, the number of false negatives due to attachment ambiguity is almost negligible in the case of verbal heads.",
        "On the other hand, the impact of undetected modifiers of a verbal head on attachment recall is considerable.",
        "The most striking feature of this large subset is the comparative sparseness of modifiers introduced by di (of): 31 out of 504 (6.2%).",
        "At a closer scrutiny, the majority of these di-phrases are either phraseological adverbial modifiers (di recente ‘of late’, del resto ‘besides’ etc.)",
        "or quasi-arguments headed by participle forms.",
        "Notably, 227 undetected modifiers (45% of the total) are selected by semantically heavy and complex (possibly discontinuous) prepositions (davanti a ‘in front of’, in mezzo a ‘amid’, verso ‘towards’, intorno a ‘around’, contro ‘against’, da ... a ‘from ... to’ etc.).",
        "As to the remaining 241 undetected modifiers (48%), they are introduced by ‘light’ prepositions such as a ‘to’, in ‘in’ and da ‘from’.",
        "Although this 48% contains a number of difficult attachments, one can identify subsets of fairly reliable modifiers by focusing on the noun head introduced by the preposition, which usually gives a strong indication of the nature of the modifier, especially in the case of measure, temporal and locative expressions."

        "The contribution of lexical information to parse success is unevenly distributed over both part of speech categories and frame types.",
        "For reasons abundantly illustrated in section 4, the frames of noun heads are not quite as useful as those of verb heads, especially when available information is only syntactic.",
        "Moreover, while information on verb transitivity or clause embedding is crucial to filter out noisy attachments, information on the preposition introducing the oblique complement or the indirect object of a verb can be misleading, and should thus be used for parsing with greater care.",
        "The main reason is that failure to register in the lexicon all possible prepositions actually found in real texts may cause undesired over-filtering of genuine arguments (false negatives).",
        "In many cases, argument prepositions are actually selected by the lexical head of the subcategorised argument, rather than by its subcategorising verb.",
        "Similarly, while information about argument optionality vs obligatoriness is seldom confirmed in real language use, statistical preferences on the order of argument realisation can be very useful.",
        "Most current lexicons say very little about temporal and circumstantial modifiers, but much more can be said about them that is useful to parsing.",
        "First, some prepositions only occur to introduce verb modifiers.",
        "These semantically heavy prepositions, often consisting of more than one lexical item, play a fundamental role in the organization of written texts, and certainly deserve a special place in a parsing-oriented lexicon.",
        "Availability of this type of lexical information could pave the way to the development of specialised “mini-parsers” of those satellite modifiers whose structural position in the sentence is subject to considerable variation.",
        "These mini-parsers could benefit from information about semantically-based classes of nouns, such as locations, measure terms, or temporal expressions, which should also contain indication of the preposition they are typically introduced by.",
        "Clearly, this move requires abandoning the prejudice that lexical information should only flow from the head to its dependents.",
        "Finally, availability of large repertoires of multi word units (both complex prepositions and compound terms) appears to have a large impact on improving parse precision.",
        "There is no doubt that harvesting such a wide range of lexical information in the quantity needed for accurate parsing will require extensive recourse to bootstrapping methods of lexical knowledge acquisition from real texts."
