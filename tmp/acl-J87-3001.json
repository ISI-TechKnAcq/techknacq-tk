        "A major factor contributing to the lack of robustness of experimental natural language understanding systems is the small number of words in the experimental semantic dictionaries used by these systems.",
        "For example \"missing vocabulary\" is cited as the most frequent cause of errors for the FRUMP system (DeJong 1979), a system designed to achieve a high degree of robustness.",
        "The problem does not disappear when dealing with limited discourse domains of the type encountered in database query and expert system interfaces.",
        "This is because of the large number of synonyms and specialized words that can occur, and because of the difficulty of delimiting discourse domains exactly.",
        "A different problem faced by designers of natural language understanding systems is how to provide for graceful failure of sentence analysis.",
        "There is thus the need to produce reasonable incomplete interpretations of sentences when complete analyses are not possible.",
        "This situation can occur because of gaps in the gram",
        "matical knowledge of the system or because the system is faced with extragrammatical input.",
        "This paper shows how a possible solution to this partial analysis problem can be applied to the vocabulary problem in the context of large machine readable dictionaries.",
        "More specifically, we will see how word sense definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, 1978 â€“ henceforth LDOCE) are processed by a phrasal analyser that applies successively more specific phrasal analysis rules.",
        "The aim of this analysis is to provide sufficient semantic information to enable a system carrying out a language processing application to cope with occurrences of unknown words.",
        "Both the problem of coping with new words and the problem of robust phrasal analysis can be thought of as instances of a more general natural language interpretation problem.",
        "This is the problem of coping with incomplete knowledge of language use; lexical knowledge in the first case and knowledge of phrasal structure in the second.",
        "The unavoidable incompleteness of the knowledge of language use available to a language processing system means that trying to achieve robust natural language processing involves developing effective mechanisms for dealing with this problem.",
        "The research",
        "reported in this paper is intended to be a contribution to this development effort.",
        "The next two sections will discuss the kind of output that may be produced from processing dictionary definitions and give examples of the results of processing LDOCE definitions produced by an implemented definition analyser.",
        "Some problems that were encountered are then discussed.",
        "Later sections motivate and explain the basic analysis algorithm, and then describe and illustrate details of analysis and structure building rules.",
        "Finally some remarks are made about the performance of the current implementation and necessary further research."

      "text": [
        "There are various possibilities for the kind of structures useful for language understanding that may be derived from dictionary definitions.",
        "These include meaning postulates (Carnap, 1952) expressed in some logic; constraints or 'semantic formulae' based on semantic primitives (Katz and Fodor, 1963, Wilks, 1975); and structures carrying information enabling the classification of the new word sense with respect to an existing classification of entities in a discourse domain.",
        "The structures produced by the implemented definition analyser belong to this last type, and examples of these structures are given later.",
        "The dictionary being used in this work, LDOCE, has features that make it particularly suitable for definition analysis.",
        "Thus many LDOCE word sense entries contain additional semantic information that could be combined, or used in conjunction with, the structures produced from processing word sense definition texts.",
        "This information is available as 'box codes' that give selectional restrictions, and 'subject codes' that indicate typical discourse domain usage of word senses (these codes occur in the machine-readable version of the dictionary, but not in the printed form).",
        "The suitability of LDOCE for work in computational linguistics has been analysed in detail by Michiels (1982).",
        "For the purpose of the work reported here, the most important property of LDOCE is the use of a restricted definition vocabulary of around 2000 words.",
        "Further, an important restriction imposed on LDOCE lexicographers is that only the 'central' senses of these words should occur in definition texts.",
        "Some ways in which the definitions diverge from a strict interpretation of this rule are discussed later.",
        "It should be remarked here that the LDOCE restricted definition vocabulary has more in common with a 'basic English' vocabulary than a set of semantic primitives.",
        "(A list of the words in the restricted definition vocabulary is given in an appendix to the published version (Procter, 1978) of the dictionary.)",
        "If the output of processing LDOCE definitions was in the form of meaning postulates, then the logic expressions produced would have a new symbol for the word sense being defined along with symbols corresponding to the senses of words in the definition vocabulary.",
        "Similarly, producing semantic primitive formulae would involve building new formulae by putting together formulae corresponding to the word senses of the definition vocabulary.",
        "For the third possible form of output listed earlier, we need a (hand-coded) classification of the central senses of the definition vocabulary together with a classification of concepts in the particular domain of discourse in terms of these word senses.",
        "The descriptions of implementations by Bobrow and Webber (1980), Mark (1981), and Alshawi (1987), show how such a classification can be organized and used during text processing.",
        "The LDOCE definition for a new word sense is processed using the mechanism described in this paper in order to extract sufficient information for including the new word sense in such a classification.",
        "A natural language processing application that depended on a classification of concepts in the discourse domain should then be able to carry out its application task despite the occurrence of a new word in an input sentence.",
        "Extracting the information necessary for classification will of course include locating superordinates in the definitions (which define the so called \"ISA\" relation) as is done in the work reported by Amsler (1981) and Calzolari (1984).",
        "However, this previous work suggests that achieving further semantic precision in a classification process requires making use of other information present in the definition (such as modifiers and predications).",
        "Examples of extracting this sort of information are presented in the next section.",
        "This way of dealing with unknown words in language processing applications still requires good solutions to the problem of choosing between alternative possible word senses (Walker and Amsler (1986) have used the LDOCE subject codes for this purpose) and to the problems involved in the classification process (see Schmolze and Lipkis, 1983).",
        "Nonetheless, providing a mechanism, as described in this paper, for extracting the information required by the classification process is a necessary first step for this approach to handling unknown words.",
        "Dictionaries vary in the level of detail provided by their semantic definitions, and, in general, producing a meaning postulate for understanding a sentence, or incorporating a word sense into a discourse domain classification, can often be done without making use of all the detail provided by the dictionary definition.",
        "Even only being able to locate the 'semantic head' (i.e. the main superordinate term) of a definition can be useful to a language processing application.",
        "This is fortunate since providing complete analyses of arbitrary dictionary definitions is beyond the current state of the art in computational linguistics.",
        "It is therefore reasonable to derive and make use of partial analyses of dictionary definitions when complete analyses are not possible.",
        "This is the approach taken in the implemented analysis system.",

        "Roughly speaking, these structures have some properties of a linguistic analysis of definition texts and some properties of a semantic definition of word sense concepts; their gross syntactic form is that of nested feature lists.",

        "In some respects the information conveyed by the output structures, being too closely tied to the surface definitions, only provides constraints for further semantic analysis.",
        "Perhaps the most important case of this is that the relationships implicit in compound nouns and certain prepositional phrase adverbials cannot, in general, be made more explicit without further interpretation apparatus (see e.g. Alshawi, 1987) beyond that available to the definition analyser.",
        "The phrasal context can, however, sometimes allow further specification of relationships implicit in prepositions, for instance derivation of PURPOSE from for in cases exemplified by the noun sense of launch (although, of course, errors can result from attempting to make relationships more explicit in this way).",
        "The actual words appearing in the semantic structures are, on the other hand, further disambiguated than might be assumed given the high degree of polysemy of many of the words in the restricted vocabulary.",

        "This is the elapsed time on a lightly loaded GEC-63 (a 32 bit mini-computer); the definition analyser was implemented in Cambridge Lisp and low level dictionary access in the language C. Finally, perhaps it is worth mentioning that the development effort was only a few man months for each of the program and grammar, which, compared with other natural language processing systems we have developed recently at Cambridge, represents a relatively small effort."

        "The work carried out so far seems to suggest that dictionary definitions can be analysed with a reasonable degree of success using hierarchies of phrasal patterns, but it still remains to be demonstrated that this technique can enable an actual natural language application system to cope effectively with unknown words.",
        "Although dictionary definitions exhibit a rich variety of forms, these are mostly variations on a manageably small number of basic forms, and it is this property of definitions that makes phrasal pattern hierarchies particularly appropriate for analysing them.",
        "It seems likely however that the analysis technique developed here would be useful for the same reason in other language processing applications, for example specialized interactive applications.",
        "One direction in which it is hoped to extend the work reported in this paper is in enhancing the capabilities of natural language processing systems for coping with idioms.",
        "Intuitively, some sort of pattern matching seems to be appropriate for analysing idioms (see e.g. Wilensky and Arens, 1980).",
        "In the context of a parsing system using an analysis hierarchy the patterns for idioms would be placed as most specialized patterns (i.e. leaves).",
        "LDOCE entries contain a wealth of information on idiomatic uses of words, and the meanings of idioms are expressed using the restricted definition vocabulary.",
        "It is hoped to extend the definition analysis system so that it would attempt to generate appropriate phrasal patterns when it encountered a definition for an idiomatic use of a word.",
        "It may then be possible to use the generated pattern and the definition of the idiom to produce a paraphrase of an input sentence before further processing takes place.",
        "In any case, a comprehensive treatment of dictionary entry analysis for language understanding systems clearly needs to take account of idiomatic word usage."
