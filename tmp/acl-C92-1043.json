        "The LF1 and LF2 interpretation rules predict specific facts about English, namely a large set of properties characterizing the differences and similarities between rationale clauses and means clauses.",
        "They do so by defining the meanings of the by and in_order_to LF predicates in terms of independently motivated action relations.",
        "These predicates are useful for representing not only the meaning of rationale clauses and means clauses, but also that of related constructions.",
        "For example, the in_order_to predicate can he used to represent the connective \"so that\" in utterances such as \"Mary got up early so that she could catch the first train to Montreal\".",
        "The by predicate can also be used for non-clausal constructions, as in \"John got the information he needed by means of an interview\".",
        "Furthermore, these predicates are meant to be language independent, In French, for example, the in_order_to predicate would be used to represent the construction \"pour + infinitive\", as in \"Marie a regarde des films pour preparer son voyage au Japon\" (Mary watched movies to prepare for her trip to Japan), and the by predicate, to represent the construction \"en + gerund\", as in \"Marie a prepare son voyage au Japon en regardant des films\" (Mary prepared for her trip to Japan by watching movies).",
        "Unlike the corresponding English construction, however, the French \"en-clause\" is ambiguous between a means clause reading (as given in the English translation) and a temporal reading that can be translated as \"while watching movies\".",
        "Determining how to disambiguate these two interpretations is an interesting research question.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we show how to distinguish algorithmically the constructions to which the LF1 and LF2 rules apply, thereby making it possible for an interpretation system to build the correct LF representations.",
        "Rationale clauses: These clauses are optional infinitival adjuncts, introduced either by the infinitival marker \"to\", or, when the subject is not missing, by the lexical item \"for\" followed by a noun phrase (realizing the subject) followed by \"to\".",
        "Both these constructions are optionally preceded by \"in order\".",
        "Note that the LF2 rule applies to rationale clauses with or without explicit subjects.",
        "For example, given \"Mary prepared lobster (in order) for her guests to have a taste of New England cuisine\", Mary's preparing lobster contributes to her guests having a taste of New England cuisine.",
        "A large number of to-infinitival clauses (with or without subjects) to which the LF2 rule does not apply can be distinguished on syntactic grounds, namely by not being optional infinitival adjuncts.",
        "Utterances that are syntactically ambiguous show a corresponding semantic ambiguity, and the LF2 rule applies to the rationale clause reading; e.g.: \"Bush warned his press secretary to prevent a leak\", where the infinitival clause may function as an optional adjunct (i.e., realizing a rationale clause) or a complement.",
        "Two types of adverbials to which the LF2 rule does not apply, but which are syntactically indistinguishable from rationale clauses, are comment clauses, as in \"John is not sure what to do, to put it briefly\", and outcome clauses, as in \"Mary awoke one morning to find the house in an uproar\" [16].",
        "Given their status as parentheticals, comment clauses are recognizable in text by a comma, and in speech by intonation (note that without the comma, the infinitival clause becomes a rationale clause).",
        "Outcome clauses are restricted to verbs of discovery or to the verbs \"be\" or \"become\" (e.g., \"She lived to be 100\"), and are therefore also distinguishable.",
        "Finally, there are purpose clauses, e.g., \"Mary bought a suit to wear at the meeting\".",
        "Purpose clauses are also optional infinitival adverbials, but differ from rationale clauses in the number and type of gaps they allow and in their control pattern' [2, 12].",
        "They also differ from the superficially similar infinitival relative clauses by not being attached to a noun phrase.",
        "The LF2 rule, in fact, makes correct predictions for this construction as well, e.g., Mary's buying a suit contributes to her wearing the suit at the meeting.",
        "Purpose clauses with inanimate subjects, however, as in \"John bought a shelf to hold his books\", require some adjustment with respect to the action's role in the Contributes relation.",
        "Actions relations are between actions, and actions are assumed to have human agents.",
        "Therefore, rather than deriving a Contributes relation between John's buying a shelf and the shelf's holding his books, the system should derive a relation between John's buying a shelf and his having something (namely the shelf) to hold his hooks.",
        "This issue is currently being investigated.",
        "Means clauses: These clauses are very easily distinguishable by their form: the lexical item \"by\" followed by an -ing clause (in this context, \"by\" may be treated as a preposition or a subordinator).",
        "Apparent counterexamples to the LF1 rule are utterances of the form \"Mary pays her rent by building furniture\", 'From a descriptive point of view, rationale clauses differ front purpose clauses in that only the former allow the paraphrase with the words \"in order to\" 1121. in which the two actions are sequential.",
        "However, the fact that LEI does not apparently apply to this example, is a sign that additional pragmatic reasoning (e.g., conversational implicatures [9]) is needed.",
        "In this particular example, LF1 does apply, though indirectly through the utterance of which it is a metaphor, namely, \"Mary makes a living by building furniture\".",
        "The need for further Gricean reasoning of this sort is reflected in the markedness of such examples."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we analyzed utterances with rationale clauses and means clauses, presented their logical form, and defined interpretation rules for these two constructions that make use of independently motivated action relations.",
        "These rules make it possible to draw appropriate inferences about the actions described in these utterances, thereby accounting for the similarities and differences between rationale clauses and means clauses.",
        "The algebraic properties of the action relations were shown to reflect the properties of the utterances that realize them.",
        "We also showed how to distinguish the constructions to which these rules apply.",
        "This analysis fills an important gap in the natural language interpretation literature.",
        "Surprisingly little research has examined multi-action utterances such as those with means clauses and rationale clauses.",
        "There is a large body of linguistics research on purpose clauses, but it focuses on syntactic aspects of the construction and issues of control (e.g., [2, 12]).",
        "In the computational linguistics literature, Buettner et al's work on the generation of adjunct clauses [11] and Di Eugenio's analysis of instructions [7, 19] both examine purpose constructions, but from different perspectives than that of this paper [5].",
        "This research is being extended in two main directions.",
        "One is to examine future tense utterances and other types of utterances about unrealized actions.",
        "Another is to cast the interpretation rules in a general processing model that takes into account the mental states of the agents involved.",
        "Beliefs and intentions are necessary for the treatment of unrealized actions, as well as for capturing other aspects of rationale clauses and means clauses.",
        "In particular, utterances with rationale clauses, but not necessarily those with means clauses, communicate the speaker's beliefs about the performing agent's intention to perform the actions described in the utterance.",
        "Finally, mental states are indispensable in any interpretation model that purports to account for inferences that are drawn on the basis of utterances.",
        "Initial progress in these two areas is reported in the companion paper [5]."
