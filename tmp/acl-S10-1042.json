        "The increasing amount of documents in electronic form makes imperative the need for document content classification and semantic labelling.",
        "Keyphrase extraction contributes to this goal by the identification of important and discriminative concepts expressed as keyphrases.",
        "Keyphrases as reduced document content representations may find applications in document retrieval, classification and summarisation (D'Avanzo and Magnini, 2005).",
        "The literature distinguishes between two principal processes: keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment.",
        "In the case of keyphrase assignment, suitable keyphrases from an existing knowledge resource, such as a controlled vocabulary, or a thesaurus are assigned to documents based on classification of their content.",
        "In keyphrase extraction, the phrases are mined from the document itself.",
        "Supervised approaches to the problem of keyphrase extraction include the Naive Bayes-based KEA algorithms (Gordon et al., 1999) (Medelyan and Witten, 2006), decision tree-based and the genetic algorithm-based GenEx (Turney, 1999), and the probabilistic KL divergence-based language model (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003).",
        "Research in keyphrase extraction proposes the detection of keyphrases based on various statistics-based, or pattern-based features.",
        "Statistical measures investigated focus primarily on keyphrase frequency measures, whereas pattern-features include noun phrase pattern filtering, identification of keyphrase head and respective frequencies (Barker and Cornacchia, 2000), document section position of the keyphrase (e.g., (Medelyan and Witten, 2006)) and keyphrase coherence (Turney, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach which combines pattern-based morphosyntactic rules with a statistical measure, the C-value measure (Frantzi et al., 2000) which originates from research in the field of automatic term recognition and was initially designed for specialised domain terminology acquisition."

      "text": [
        "The input documents in the Keyphrase Extraction task were scientific articles converted from their originally published form to plain text.",
        "Due to this process, some compound hyphenated words are erroneously converted into a single word (e.g., \"resourcemanagement\" vs. \"resource-management\").",
        "Moreover, document sections such as tables, figures, footnotes, headers and footers, often intercept sentence and paragraph text.",
        "Finally, due to the particularity of the scientific articles domain, input documents often contain irregular text, such as URLs, inline bibliographic references, mathematical formulas and symbols.",
        "In our approach, we attempted to address some of these issues by document structuring, treatment of orthographic variation and filtering of irregular text.",
        "The approach adopted first applies part-of-speech tagging and basic document structuring (sec.",
        "2.1 and 2.2).",
        "Subsequently, keyphrase candidates conforming to predefined morphosyntactic rule patterns are identified (sec.",
        "2.3).",
        "In the next stage, orthographic, morphological and abbreviation variation phenomena are addressed (sec.",
        "2.4) and, finally, candidate keyphrases are selected based on C-value statistical measure (sec.",
        "2.5).",
        "For morphosyntactic analysis, we used the Maxent (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) POS tagger implementation of the openNLP toolsuite.",
        "In order to improve tagging accuracy, irregular text, such as URLs, inline references, and recurrent patterns indicating footers and mathematical formulas are filtered prior to tagging.",
        "Document structuring is based on identified recurrent patterns, such as common section titles and legend indicators (e.g., \"Abstract\", \"Table...\"), section headers numbering and preserved formatting, such as newline characters.",
        "Thus, the document sections that the system may recognise are: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion, Acknowledgements, References, Header (for any other section headers and legends) and Main (for any other document section text).",
        "The UvT system considers as candidate keyphrases, those multi-word noun phrases conforming to predefined morphosyntactic rule patterns.",
        "In particular, the patterns considered are:",
        "where M is a modifier, such as an adjective, a noun, a present or past participle, or a proper noun including a possessive ending, N is a noun, P a preposition and C a conjunction.",
        "For every sentence input, the matching process is exhaustive: after the longest valid match is identified, the rules are re-applied, so as to identify all possible shorter valid matches for nested noun phrases.",
        "At this stage, the rules also allow for inclusion of potential abbreviations and acronyms in the identified noun phrase of the form:",
        "where (A) is a potential acronym appearing as a single token in uppercase, enclosed by parentheses and tagged as a proper noun.",
        "In this processing stage, the objective is the recognition and reduction of variation phenomena which, if left untreated, will affect the C-value statistical measures at the keyphrase selection stage.",
        "Variation is a pervasive phenomenon in terminology and is generally defined as the alteration of the surface form of a terminological concept (lacquemin, 2001).",
        "In our approach, we attempt to address morphological variation, i.e., variation due to morphological affixes and orthographic variation, such as hyphenated vs. non-hyphenated compound phrases and abbreviated phrase forms vs. full noun phrase forms.",
        "In order to reduce morphological variation, UvT system uses the J.Renie interface to WordNet lexicon to acquire lemmas for the respective candidate phrases.",
        "Orthographic variation phenomena are treated by rule matching techniques.",
        "In this process, for every candidate keyphrase matching a rule, the respective string alternations are generated and added as variant phrases.",
        "For example, for patterns including acronyms and the respective full form, alternative variant phrases generated may contain either the full form only, or the acronym replacing its respective full form.",
        "Similarly, for hyphenated words, non-hyphenated forms are generated.",
        "The statistical measure used for keyphrase ranking and selection is the C-value measure (Frantzi et al., 2000).",
        "C-value was originally proposed for defining potential terminological phrases and is based on normalising frequency of occurrence measures",
        "Table 1 : UvT, UvT variants and baseline systems performance on the Keyphrase Extraction Task by taking into consideration the candidate multiword phrase constituent length and terms appearing as nested within longer terms.",
        "In particular, depending on whether a candidate multi-word phrase is nested or not, C-value is defined as:",
        "In the above, the first C-value measurement is for non-nested terms and the second for nested terms, where a denotes the word sequence that is proposed as a term, \\a\\ is the length of this term in words, /(a) is the frequency of occurrence of this term in the corpus, both as an independent term and as a nested term within larger terms, and P{Ta) denotes the probability of a term string occurring as nested term.",
        "In this processing stage of keyphrase selection, we start by measuring frequency of occurrence for all our candidate phrases, taking into consideration phrase variants, as identified in the Text normalisation stage.",
        "Then, we proceed by calculating nested phrases frequences and, finally, we estimate C-value.",
        "The result of this process is a list of proposed keyphrases, ranked by decreasing C-value measure, wherefrom the top 15 were selected for the evaluation of the system results."

        "Table 1 also illustrates the reported performance of the task baseline systems (i.e., TF IDF, Naive Bayes (NB) and maximum entropy (ME) ) and the UvT system performance variance based on document section candidates (-A: Abstract, -I: Introduction, -M: Main, -IC: Introduction and Conclusion combination).",
        "In these system variants, rather than selecting the top 15 C-value candidates from the system output, we also apply restrictions based on the candidate keyphrase document section information, thus skipping candidates which do not appear in the respective document section.",

        "We observe that the system exhibits higher performance for its top 5 candidate set and this performance drops rapidly as we include more terms in the answer set.",

        "As indicated in Table 1, the improved results of system variants based on document sections, such as Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion, where these symbols and formulas are rather uncommon, could be partly attributed to \"noise\" reduction.",
