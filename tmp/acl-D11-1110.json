        "This validates the effectiveness of the RCA assumption and the constituency projection method, and indicates that the RCA assumption is more suitable for constituency projection than the DCA assumption.",
        "The projected parser also obviously surpasses the unsupervised parsers.",
        "This suggests that if a resource-poor language has a bilingual corpus parallel to a resource-rich language with a human-annotated treebank, the constituency projection based on RCA assumption is an promising substitute for unsupervised methods.",

        "Although achieving appealing results, our current work is quite coarse and has many aspects to be improved.",
        "First, the word alignment is the fundamental precondition for projected grammar induction and the following constituency projection, we can adopt the better word alignment strategies to improve the word alignment quality.",
        "Second, the PCFG grammar is too weak due to its context free assumption, we can adopt more complicated grammars such as TAG (Joshi et al., 1975), in order to provide a more powerful global syntactic constraints for the tree projection procedure.",
        "Third, the current tree projection algorithm is too simple, more bilingual constraints could lead to better projected trees.",
        "Last but not least, the constituency projection and the unsupervised parsing make use of different kinds of knowledge, therefore the unsupervised methods can be integrated into the constituency projection framework to achieve better projected grammars, treebanks, and parsers."
