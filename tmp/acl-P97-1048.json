        "One of the fundamental characteristics of language, viewed as a stochastic process, is that it is highly nonstationary.",
        "Throughout a written document and during the course of spoken conversation, the topic evolves, effecting local statistics on word occurrences.",
        "The standard trigram model disregards this nonstationarity, as does any stochastic grammar which assigns probabilities to sentences in a context-independent fashion.",
        "'Research supported in part by NSF grant IRI9314969, DARPA AASERT award DAAH04-95-1-0475, and the ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories.",
        "Stationary models are used to describe such a dynamic source for at least two reasons.",
        "The first is convenience: stationary models require a relatively small amount of computation to train and to apply.",
        "The second is ignorance: we know so little about how to model effectively the nonstationary characteristics of language that we have for the most part completely neglected the problem.",
        "From a theoretical standpoint, we appeal to the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem (Cover and Thomas, 1991) whenever computing perplexities on test data; yet this result only rigorously applies to stationary and ergodic sources.",
        "To allow a language model to adapt to its recent context, some researchers have used techniques to update trigram statistics in a dynamic fashion by creating a cache of the most recently seen n-grams which is smoothed together (typically by linear interpolation) with the static model; see for example (Jelinek et al., 1991; Kuhn and de Mori, 1990).",
        "Another approach, using maximum entropy methods similar to those that we present here, introduces a parameter for trigger pairs of mutually informative words, so that the occurrence of certain words in recent context boosts the probability of the words that they trigger (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "Triggers have also been incorporated through different methods (Kuhn and de Mori, 1990; Ney, Essen, and Kneser, 1994).",
        "All of these techniques treat the recent context as a \"bag of words,\" so that a word that appears, say, five positions back makes the same contribution to prediction as words at distances of 50 or 500 positions back in the history.",
        "In this paper we introduce new modeling techniques based on exponential families for capturing the long-range correlations between occurrences of words in text and speech.",
        "We show how for both written text and conversational speech, the empirical distribution of the distance between trig",
        "ger words exhibits a striking behavior in which the \"attraction\" between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic constraints create a \"repulsion\" between words that discourages close co-occurrence.",
        "We have discovered that this observed behavior is well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions.",
        "Though in common use in queueing theory, such distributions have not, to our knowledge, been previously exploited in speech and language processing.",
        "It is remarkable that the behavior of a highly complex stochastic process such as the separation between word co-occurrences is well modeled by such a simple parametric family, just as it is surprising that Zipf's law can so simply capture the distribution of word frequencies in most languages.",
        "In the following section we present examples of the empirical evidence for the effects of distance.",
        "In Section 3 we outline the class of statistical models that we propose to model this data.",
        "After completing this work we learned of a related paper (Niesler and Woodland, 1997) which constructs similar models.",
        "In Section 4 we present a parameter estimation algorithm, based on the EM algorithm, for determining the maximum likelihood estimates within the class.",
        "In Section 5 we explain how distance models can be incorporated into an exponential language model, and present sample perplexity results we have obtained using this class of models."

        "The work described in this paper began with the goal of building a statistical language model using a static trigram model as a \"prior,\" or default distribution, and adding certain features to a family of conditional exponential models to capture some of the nonstationary features of text.",
        "The features we used were simple \"trigger pairs\" of words that were chosen on the basis of mutual information.",
        "Figure 1 provides a small sample of the 41,263 (s,t) trigger pairs used in most of the experiments we will describe.",
        "In earlier work, for example (Rosenfeld, 1996), the distance between the words of a trigger pair (s, t) plays no role in the model, meaning that the \"boost\" in probability which t receives following its trigger s is independent of how long ago s occurred, so long as s appeared somewhere in the history H, a fixed-length window of words preceding t. It is reasonable to expect, however, that the relevance of a word s to the identity of the next word should decay as s falls",
        "further and further back into the context.",
        "Indeed, there are tables in (Rosenfeld, 1996) which suggest that this is so, and distance-dependent \"memory weights\" are proposed in (Ney, Essen, and Kneser, 1994).",
        "We decided to investigate the effect of distance in more detail, and were surprised by what we found.",
        "The set of 41,263 trigger pairs was partitioned into 20 groups of non-self triggers (s,t), s t, such as (Soviet, Kremlin's), and 20 groups of self triggers (s, s), such as (business, business).",
        "Figure 3 displays the empirical probability that a word t appears for the first time k words after the appearance of its mate s in a trigger pair (s, t), for two representative groups.",
        "The curves are striking in both their similarities and their differences.",
        "Both curves seem to have more or less flattened out by N = 400, which allows us to make the approximating assumption (of great practical importance) that word-triggering effects may be neglected after several hundred words.",
        "The most prominent distinction between the two curves is the peak near k = 25 in the self trigger plots; the non-self trigger plots suggest a monotonic decay.",
        "The shape of the self trigger curve, in particular the rise between k = 1 and k r.r.",
        "25, reflects the stylistic and syntactic injunctions against repeating a word too soon.",
        "This effect, which we term the lexical exclusion principle, does not appear for non-self triggers.",
        "In general, the lexical exclusion principle seems to be more in effect for uncommon words, and thus the peak for such words is shifted further to the right.",
        "While the details of the curves vary depending on the particular triggers, this behavior appears to be universal.",
        "For triggers that appear too few times in the data for this behavior to exhibit itself, the curves emerge when the counts are pooled with those from a collection of other rare words.",
        "An example of this law of large numbers is shown in Figure 4.",
        "These empirical phenomena are not restricted to the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "In fact, we have observed similar behavior in conversational speech and Japanese text.",
        "The corresponding data for self triggers in the Switchboard data (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel, 1992), for instance, exhibits the same bump in p(k) for small k, though the peak is closer to zero.",
        "The lexical exclusion principle, then, seems to be less applicable when two people are conversing, perhaps because the stylistic concerns of written communication are not as important in conversation.",
        "Several examples from the Switchboard and Nikkei corpora are shown in Figure 5."

        "The empirical data presented in the previous section exhibits three salient characteristics.",
        "First is the decay of the probability of a word t as the distance k from the most recent occurrence of its mate s increases.",
        "The most important (continuous-time) distribution with this property is the single-parameter exponential family",
        "(We'll begin by showing the continuous analogues of the discrete formulas we actually use, since they are simpler in appearance.)",
        "This family is uniquely characterized by the memoryless property that the probability of waiting an additional length of time At is independent of the time elapsed so far, and",

        "This distribution is a good candidate for modeling non-self triggers.",

        "This behavior appears when two exponential distributions are arranged in serial, and such distributions are an important tool in the \"method of stages\" in queueing theory (Klein-rock, 1975).",
        "The time it takes to travel through two service facilities arranged in serial, where the first provides exponential service with rate pi and the second provides exponential service with rate p2, is simply the convolution of the two exponentials:",

        "The two-stage exponential is a good candidate for distance modeling because of its mathematical properties, but it is also well-motivated for linguistic reasons.",
        "The first queue in the two-stage model represents the stylistic and syntactic constraints that prevent a word from being repeated too soon.",
        "After this waiting period, the distribution falls off exponentially, with the memoryless property.",
        "For non-self triggers, the first queue has a waiting time of zero, corresponding to the absence of linguistic constraints against using t soon after s when the words s and t are different.",
        "Thus, we are directly modeling the \"lexical exclusion\" effect and long-distance decay that have been observed empirically.",
        "The third artifact of the empirical data is the tendency of the curves to approach a constant, positive value for large distances.",
        "While the exponential distribution quickly approaches zero, the empirical data settles down to a nonzero steady-state value.",
        "Together these three features suggest modeling distance with a three-parameter family of distributions:",
        "where c > 0 and 7 is a normalizing constant.",
        "Rather than a continuous-time exponential, we use the discrete-time analogue",
        "In this case, the two-stage model becomes the discrete-time convolution",

        "It should be pointed out that there is another parametric family that is an excellent candidate for distance models, based on the first two features noted above.",
        "This is the Gamma distribution",
        "This distribution has mean a/16 and variance a/02 and thus can afford greater flexibility in fitting the empirical data.",
        "For Bayesian analysis, this distribution is appropriate as the conjugate prior for the exponential parameter p (Gelman et al., 1995).",
