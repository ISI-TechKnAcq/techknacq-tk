        "Preserving a memory of past events has been central to human culture for millennia and may even be seen as a defining element of cultural life in general.",
        "The practice of specifying locations in time for this purpose transcends cultural boundaries.",
        "The earliest precursors of the Chinese lunisolar calendar can be traced back to the second millennium before Christ.",
        "In ancient Attica the 'eponymous archon' lent his name to the year he ruled in and a similar system was employed by republican Romans.",
        "The introduction of the Julian calendar and its Georgian reform, although haphazardly adopted, has eventually led to a widely accepted standard for locating events in time (although alternative calendars exist and thrive to this day).",
        "The advent of the computer age has brought with it stricter requirements for such standards, for instance that of unambiguous machine readability.",
        "A number of such standards for encoding the meaning or extension of temporal expressions have emerged in recent years (ISO 8601, TimeML, VRA core).",
        "However, legacy records in the field of cultural heritage still abound with natural language descriptions of dates and date ranges that are not expressed in a standardised form, such as \"around 1660\", \"late 15th century\", \"1720-30 (?)\".",
        "The non-standard nature of such expressions is compounded by inherent uncertainty about the dates which is expressed through uncertainty markers such as \"around\", \"(?)\"",
        "or similar.",
        "While human experts have little difficulty interpreting such expressions these are not amenable to machine-based processing and thus are not directly useful for querying databases based on dates, for instance.",
        "The latter purpose is much better served by date ranges with a clear beginning and end.",
        "We argue for conceptually splitting the process of 'translating', 'converting' or otherwise associating informal descriptions of dates with concrete date ranges with an unambiguous beginning and end.",
        "A first step should capture the semantics of the original expression including possible uncertainty markers with as little loss in meaning as possible.",
        "1 The target of this step should be a language independent ontology or semantic standard, such as the VRA core 4.0 date element.",
        "A second step should then map from a representation in the semantic standard to a date range with concrete beginning and end according to user, institution or context specific preferences, using intelligent defaults in the absence of preferences.",
        "1 What we mean by minimising 'loss in meaning' is essentially that in a first step uncertainty markers should be kept (albeit in a standardized form) rather then resolved to a date range (i.e. 'c.1888??",
        "?c(1888)?",
        "instead of ?c.1888??",
        "?1878-1898?).",
        "In this paper we describe a prototype system designed to resolve temporal expressions from English language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601 compatible date expressions.",
        "The system is inspired by a similar system for German language records and was tested on real life data from the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin and evaluated by two senior art and metadata experts from the gallery.",
        "The default rules for converting the ?meaning?",
        "of date expressions to date ranges were found to be superior to the heuristics currently configured by the National Gallery in their collection management system.",
        "2 Background The National Gallery of Ireland (NGI) has developed a set of in-house standards for cataloguing date expressions related to the creation of artworks (Appendix A and B).",
        "These standards complement the editorial guidelines outlined in the NGI house style guide for works of art in the collection and they must be applied when entering the data into the relevant field on TMS 2 (The Museum System), the collection management system used by the Gallery.",
        "These guidelines have been created based on best practice standards for cataloguing date expressions.",
        "There are several authoritative resources that institutions can consult to draft their own in house cataloguing standards, including date format and epoch descriptors: AAT 3 (Art & Architecture Thesaurus), CDWA 4 (Categories for the Description of Works of Art) or the AAE Style Guide 5 (Association of Art Editors Style Guide), to mention just a few.",
        "As shown in Appendix A and B, the NGI standards cover a diverse set of date expressions, from specific dates to more generic ones, giving the opportunity to enter into the system a range of years, decades or centuries.",
        "The date values are expressed as four digit years.",
        "More specific dates related to other events connected to the creation of the art work (for example for published volumes or different print editions), are recorded in the ?Historical Dates field?",
        "where the required date can be selected from a pop up calendar and the type of date can be selected from a drop down list (for example ?Published?).",
        "The Date label on TMS consists of three main fields: Date, which displays the actual date or range of dates related to the creation of the art work and which appears on the main object record screen as part of the basic object tombstone information; Begin Date and End Date, which represent the earliest and the latest possible years from a range of dates during which the artwork was created (Fig. 1).",
        "The Begin Date and End Date are not displayed in the Date label on the data entry screen of a record, as they are used for indexing and searching purposes only.",
        "Through the Simple Search and the Advanced Search functionality in the system it is possible to retrieve records with a range of dates, by either searching for earliest date, latest date or a certain time between these dates, the resulting records being drawn from the values recorded in the Begin and End Date.",

        "The suggestions can be accepted or modified manually and then saved.",
        "A date expression can also be suggested by the system when entering the relevant years directly into Begin and End Date.",
        "In this case the ?Calc?",
        "button prompts a pop up window with different date expressions based on the years inserted as beginning and end.",
        "For example, by entering ?1575?",
        "and ?1578?",

        "; ?late 16th century?.",
        "When date ranges include two specific years (for example in the case of ?YYYY/YYYY?",
        "or ?YYYY-YYYY?)",
        "the two year values are automatically suggested in the Begin and End Date fields.",
        "When a single year is inserted in the Date field, the Begin and End Date are automatically filled with that same year value.",
        "Through the configuration menu it is possible to specify the range of years to be ?suggested?",
        "in the Begin and End Date when entering a particular date expression in the Date field.",
        "By default this applies for the circa label (in the NGI case the range is 5 years before and after the specified date) and decades.",
        "Although the automatic suggestions for Begin and End Date are configurable through the back end of the system, manual input is still necessary for accuracy when entering certain date expressions.",
        "Centuries for example (in all their formats, from ?xxth century?",
        "to ?early/mid/late xxth century?)",
        "are not recognized by Begin and End Date, which in these cases need to be filled in manually.",
        "However the process works in reverse: when inserting the correct earliest and latest year that indicate a century span, the suggestion box for the Date field displays different options, including the correct ?xxth century?",
        "format.",
        "On the other hand, in the case of decades, the relevant Begin Date and End Date are correctly suggested when inserting the ?YYYYs?",
        "format in the Date field, while, when entering the relevant years indicating the time span of a decade in the Begin and End date, the options listed as suggestions for the Date field do not include the correct format, giving instead the option of selecting ?YYYY-YYYY?",
        "as an alternative.",
        "Similarly the Date field does not distinguish between years separated by an ?or?, a dash or a hyphen when displaying the suggestions based on years inserted in Begin and End Date: when two different years are inserted in the Begin and End Date, the only relevant option listed by the system is the range of years separated by a hyphen.",
        "However, when entering the same date expressions in the Date field whether separated by ?or?, dash or hyphen, the correct values are inserted in the Begin and End Date.",
        "As the Date field is a free-text field on TMS, the process of manually entering date values, especially the ones that indicate uncertainty and include a prefix and non-numerical values, gives more room for error.",
        "In addition to this, not every date expression inserted in the Date field is recognised by the Begin and End Dates, in which case these also have to be entered manually.",
        "At the same time the automatic suggestions given for the Date field when entering Begin Date and End seem to be more comprehensive and work better and they are helpful in giving the opportunity to select the correct option without having to manually enter the data, thus reducing the possibility of error.",
        "In the case of the NGI some configuration is further needed to make the most of the automated system already in place.",
        "In particular it would be useful to include in the provided suggestions for the Begin and End Date, those date expressions that are not currently recognised by the system.",
        "3 Methodology and data set The development of our system is inspired by an earlier system of temporal expression resolution for German language date expressions, an auxiliary part of a research project concerned with information retrieval on digital repositories of works of art, (Isemann and Ahmad, 2014).",
        "The approach was an iterative development cycle of successively resolving ever more complex date and time descriptors and mapping them to unambiguous time spans in ISO 8601 format.",
        "The data used were German date entries in a commercially available digital collection of 40,000 works of art.",
        "6 Example expressions from this data set are: ?1707-1712?, ?1734/39?, ?1790-3?, ?12./13.",
        "Jh.",
        "?, ?1.",
        "Drittel 16.",
        "Jh.",
        "?, ?1420-1375 v.",
        "Chr.?.",
        "These examples represent date ranges that have a fairly well defined beginning and end.",
        "One may perhaps argue whether the 13th century should include the year 1300 or not, but in general the intended 6 The DVD collection ?40000 Meisterwerke?, published by Directmedia Publishing.",
        "43 boundaries are reasonably clear.",
        "The following examples, however, are compounded by the fact that they contain uncertainty markers which leave the precise date range that should be assigned to them up to context and interpretation: ?um 1568?, ?1642 (?",
        ")?, ?Vor 1650?, ?ab 1486?, ?nach 1776-77?.",
        "For the experiments presented here, we obtained a similar although much smaller English language data set from the National Gallery of Ireland.",
        "The data consisted of 939 records from the NGI database, comprising date expressions such as ?1791 to 1794?, ?1870/72?, ?1740s?, ?18th century?, ?1st February 1751?, ?",
        "?c.1893?, ?after 1752?, ?late 16th century?, ?mid-1930s?.",
        "Unlike in the German data set, most date expressions in the NGI data are already associated with a ?Begin Date?",
        "and ?End Date?",
        "either calculated by the NGI collection management system or manually entered by NGI staff (compare Section 2).",
        "These date ranges sanctioned by art experts present a valuable additional resource which may serve as training data for statistical learning or as a benchmark to compare against.",
        "In contrast to the German language system we are conceptually using a two stage approach in which we first attempt to represent the intended meaning of a date expression (?intension?)",
        "and only then map it to a date range for search and retrieval (one might call this range the ?extension?",
        "of a date expression).",
        "For the representation of date expression semantics (intension) we have chosen the VRA core 4.0 set of metadata elements and here in particular the ?date?",
        "element.",
        "7 VRA core is a set of categories defined and maintained by the Data Standards Committee of the Visual Resources Association.",
        "8 The latest version 4.0 dates from 2007.",
        "The standard has been used for semantic annotation (cf. Hollink et al. (2003) which use VRA core 3.0) and defines mappings to other metadata schemata, such as Dublin Core, 9 CDWA, 10 CCO 11 (Cataloging Cultural Objects) and its own predecessors (VRA core 2.0 and 3.0).",
        "As value ranges the standard recommends widely used thesauri (AAT 12 ) or controlled vocabularies (ULAN 13 ) or in the case of dates the ISO 8601 standard.",
        "Structurally, the standard prescribes that ?date?",
        "elements have a ?type?",
        "attribute (such as ?creation?, ?design?, ?alteration?)",
        "and may have an ?earliestDate?",
        "and ?latestDate?",
        "subelement, both of which should only take ISO 8601 compatible values and can be modified by a boolean ?circa?",
        "attribute.",
        "The semantic representation is the point of departure for the resolution of a date expression to a concrete date range.",
        "This leaves room for interpretation, especially in cases where a ?circa?",
        "flag is present.",
        "Ideally this mapping should be governed by preferences at the user and/or institution level (similar to the guidelines presented in Appendices A and B).",
        "While the interpretation of these dates may vary on a case-by-case basis and even experts may disagree, we believe that certain default rules will allow at least a rough approximation of the intended time range in many cases.",
        "Analysing the data we noticed that mentions of years are not uniformly distributed in terms of the digit they end on.",
        "Figure 2 shows the relative frequency of year end digits for the German data set (red line) in expressions involving a ?circa?",
        "flag (German: ?um?).",
        "Assuming a uniform distribution of years the frequencies should be 801.1 throughout.",
        "It is statistically extremely unlikely that the observed deviation from a uniform distribution is due to chance variation (chi squared test, 9 degrees of freedom, p < 0.001).",
        "As it appears equally unlikely that artists over the centuries have had a particular propensity to be more productive in years ending in 0 and 5, we believe that the natural explanation is that art historians documenting temporality tend to gravitate to \"round\" numbers in cases of greater uncertainty.",
        "As an upshot we would like to suggest that all else being equal approximate dates involving years should be seen as less certain if they end in 0 or 5 than if they end in other digits.",
        "Accordingly we add ?10 years to years ending in ?0?, ?5 to years ending in ?5?",
        "and ?1 to years ending in other digits.",

        "Note, that not all expressions which may informally appear vague involve a circa attribute and that we assign a latest date by default for cases such as ?after 1752?, contrary to the VRA core recommendation (which we adopt as semantic representation for such cases).",
        "4 Experiments We implemented a rule-based date expression resolver for the expressions in the English language National Gallery data set (achieving nearly complete coverage) with the set of heuristics outlined in the previous section (cf. Table 1).",
        "Two art history and meta data experts from the National Gallery agreed to participate in an evaluation of the output of our resolution system compared against the current date range entry in the National Gallery database.",
        "The entries in the NGI database are not a direct feature of the collection management system, but rather of how the system is currently used.",

        "In order not to burden our volunteers?",
        "time too much we did not evaluate on the complete data set, but on a randomly extracted subset in which we only included cases where our system output differed from the existing gallery records.",
        "We used a random number generator in Java to extract records until we reached a limit of 50 cases in which the two date interpretations were different.",
        "This limit was reached after selecting a total of 104 entries.",
        "The 50 non-trivial cases were compiled into a list comprised of the original date expression and a choice of two different date ranges each, one from the NGI records and one from our system.",
        "The order of the choices was randomized independently for each individual record.",
        "The two evaluation participants were given this list together with a short introductory text outlining the background and purpose of the evaluation.",
        "They were then instructed to select which of the two date range alternatives they felt best captured the meaning of the date expression or indicate that they had no preference.",
        "Introductory paragraphs in the evaluation stressed that while individual context may sometimes enter into such a decision, they should think of the given date expressions as generic examples.",
        "5 Results Of the 100 individual decisions made by our two experts (50 each) exactly half (50) were in favour of our system's default recommendation, less than a third were in favour of the existing database entry (29) 45 and just over one in five (21) had no particular preference (Table 2).",

        "While this may be seen as an encouraging result for our date range recommender system it has to be said that in their overall preference our two evaluators were leaning different ways.",
        "While one overwhelmingly agreed with our system recommendations (preferring the NGI alternative in just two cases with nine ties), the other was leaning towards the NGI records (preferring our system in just eleven cases with twelve ties).",
        "Overall the two evaluators agreed in ten of the 50 cases (Cohen's kappa = -0.048).",
        "We believe that the reason for the differing opinions between our two evaluators may be that one of them is working closely with the NGI database and is therefore very familiar with the status quo, including certain agreed in-house standards.",
        "The other evaluator, who was leaning towards the rules implemented in our system, is from the curatorial department and concerned with absolute and relative dating of works of art in a more theoretical way.",

        "Furthermore, he finds that certain dates are expressed as a calendar day and others refer merely to the year an event occurred.",
        "These expressions can prove problematic for traditional date processing algorithms, and often a more complex mapping is required to convert these textual representations to a computational formalism such as the CIDOC specification.",
        "Chang and Manning (2012) focus on generic temporal expressions with their SUTIME parser, which represents date and temporal information extracted from text using the TIMEX3 tag format from the TimeML (Boguraev and Ando (2005)) standard.",
        "An emerging trend in date resolution literature encompasses the big data paradigm.",
        "Blamey et al. (2013) develop a probabilistic approach toward modelling everyday natural language date expressions 17 using textual data from image descriptions and EXIF 18 data from uploaded photos on the flickr website.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented and tested a system specifically designed for the resolution of date expressions in cultural heritage legacy records and we have argued for a ?semantic layer?",
        "between the literal expressions and the date range resolution.",
        "Our evaluation, although small scale, suggests that such a system may potentially be able to improve even records which already incorporate date resolutions, if slightly more complex rules than are contained in the current system or data entry guidelines are implemented.",
        "A number of possible lines of future work suggest themselves.",
        "In order to arrive at an explicit local grammar for ?heritage dates?",
        "(cf. Kauppinen et al. (2010) and Angeli et al. (2012)), we have created a context-free grammar, that accepts roughly the same input as our current rule set.",
        "Initial examination suggests that the non-lexical part of the grammar can cover both English and German language data given appropriate lexicons.",
        "The grammar phrases can be mapped to representations in the semantic layer thereby in effect creating a system which could process multilingual input and produce consistent output.",
        "A further extension to the system would involve the processing of semantically more complex temporal period expressions, such as ?Victorian?, ?Edwardian?, ?Gr?nderzeit?, ?Gilded Age?",
        "or ?Renaissance?.",
        "Examples tied to the reign of a monarch tend towards a more defined scope however wider-ranging and more culturally-disputed periods such as ?the Renaissance?",
        "tend to attract a less precise beginning and end-date than the former examples and may require a more complex set of semantics.",
        "Data-driven approaches could be employed to model the temporal boundaries for temporal expressions of a more vague nature.",
        "Angeli et al. (2012) demonstrate that this may be feasible even on relatively small datasets.",
        "Examples which could benefit from an ontological augmentation involving events and periods include the practice of dating works of art with implicit reference to such periods based on a believed or previously confirmed date for a major event such as a battle or war.",
        "One example of this practice could be an artwork dated ?after 1453?, with the date actually representing the current dating of the fall of Constantinople.",
        "As historical information is updated or revised, the corresponding date range estimating the temporal origin of a work could be resolved based on updated information for the reference event.",
        "Similar suggestions were made in (Isemann and Ahmad, 2009).",
        "Perhaps the practically most relevant example of this kind could be cross-referencing the lifespan of an artist associated with the production 16 A geographical, physical and historical dictionary of Tuscany 17 Their work focuses on UK-specific cultural expressions such as Bonfire Night, first day of summer, Christmas holidays.",
        "18 Timestamps saved by digital cameras.",
        "47 of a work with the temporal expression for its creation: if the expression says 'after 1756' but we have concrete knowledge that the artist died in 1758, this can be used to add bounds to the creation event.",
