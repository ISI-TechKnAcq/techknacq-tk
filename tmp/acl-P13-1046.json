        "Spoken dialog systems interact with users via natural language to help them achieve a goal.",
        "As the interaction progresses, the dialog manager maintains a representation of the state of the dialog in a process called dialog state tracking.",
        "For example, in a bus schedule information system, the dialog state might indicate the user's desired bus route, origin, and destination.",
        "Dialog state tracking is difficult because automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) errors are common, and can cause the system to misunderstand the user's needs.",
        "At the same time, state tracking is crucial because the system relies on the estimated dialog state to choose actions ?",
        "for example, which bus schedule information to present to the user.",
        "The dialog state tracking problem can be formalized as follows (Figure 1).",
        "Each system turn in the dialog is one datapoint.",
        "For each datapoint, the input consists of three items: a set of K features that describes the current dialog context, G dialog state hypotheses, and for each dialog state hypothesis, M features that describe that dialog state hypothesis.",
        "The task is to assign a probability distribution over the G dialog state hypotheses, plus a meta-hypothesis which indicates that none of the G hypotheses is correct.",
        "Note that G varies across turns (datapoints) ?",
        "for example, in the first turn of Figure 1, G = 3, and in the second and third turns G = 5.",
        "Also note that the dialog state tracker is not predicting the contents of the dialog state hypotheses; the dialog state hypotheses contents are given by some external process, and the task is to predict a probability distribution over them, where the probability assigned to a hypothesis indicates the probability that it is correct.",
        "It is a requirement that the G hypotheses are disjoint; with the special ?everything else?",
        "meta-hypothesis, exactly one hypothesis is correct by construction.",
        "After the dialog state tracker has output its distribution, this distribution is passed to a separate, downstream process that chooses what action to take next (e.g., how to respond to the user).",
        "Dialog state tracking can be seen an analogous to assigning a probability distribution over items on an ASR N-best list given speech input and the recognition output, including the contents of the N-best list.",
        "In this task, the general features describe the recognition overall (such as length of utterance), and the hypothesis-specific features describe each N-best entry (such as decoder cost).",
        "?",
        "Work done while at Microsoft Research",
        "Another analogous task is assigning a probability distribution over a set of URLs given a search query and the URLs.",
        "Here, general features describe the whole set of results, e.g., number of words in the query, and hypothesis-specific features describe each URL, e.g., the fraction of query words contained in page.",
        "For dialog state tracking, most commercial systems use hand-crafted heuristics, selecting the SLU result with the highest confidence score, and discarding alternatives.",
        "In contrast, statistical approaches compute a posterior distribution over many hypotheses for the dialog state.",
        "The key insight is that dialog is a temporal process in which correlations between turns can be harnessed to overcome SLU errors.",
        "Statistical state tracking has been shown to improve task completion in end-to-end spoken dialog systems (Bohus and Rudnicky (2006); Young et al. (2010); Thomson and Young (2010)).",
        "Two types of statistical state tracking approaches have been proposed.",
        "Generative approaches (Horvitz and Paek (1999); Williams and Young (2007); Young et al. (2010); Thomson and Young (2010)) use generative models that capture how the SLU results are generated from hidden dialog states.",
        "These models can be used to track an arbitrary number of state hypotheses, but cannot easily incorporate large sets of potentially informative features (e.g. from ASR, SLU, dialog history), resulting in poor probability estimates.",
        "As an illustration, in Figure 1, a generative model might fail to assign the highest score to the correct hypothesis (61C) after the second turn.",
        "In contrast, discriminative approaches use conditional models, trained in a discriminative fashion (Bohus and Rudnicky (2006)) to directly estimate the distribution over a set of state hypotheses based on a large set of informative features.",
        "They generally produce more accurate distributions, but in their current form they can only track a handful of state hypotheses.",
        "As a result, the correct hypothesis may be discarded: for instance, in Figure 1, a discriminative model might consider only the top 2 SLU results, and thus fail to consider the correct 61C hypothesis at all.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to develop a new discriminative model for dialog state tracking that can operate over an arbitrary number of hypotheses and still compute accurate probability estimates.",
        "We also explore the relative importance of different feature sets for this task, and measure the amount of data required to reliably train our model."

        "Finally, DISCDYN3 extends DISCDYN2 by including conjunctions of the ordinal-valued general features with ordinal-valued hypothesis-specific features.",
        "For example, if the 3-way hypothesis-specific indicator feature for rank described above were conjoined with a 4-way general indicator feature for dialog state, the result would be an indicator of dimension 3 ?",
        "4 = 12.",
        "This expansion results in approximately 10(M + K) weights to learn in DISCDYN3.2 For comparison, we also estimated a simpler alternative model, called DISCIND.",
        "This model consists of 2 binary classifiers: the first one scores each hypothesis in isolation, using the M hypothesis-specific features for that hypothesis + the K general features for that turn, and outputs a (single) probability that the hypothesis is correct.",
        "For this classifier, each hypothesis (not each turn) defines a data instance.",
        "The second binary classifier takes the K general features, and outputs a probability that the rest meta-hypothesis is correct.",
        "For this second classifier, each turn defines one data instance.",
        "The output of these two models is then calibrated with isotonic regression (Zadrozny and Elkan (2002)) and normalized to generate the",
        "features are denoted as b, ASR/SLU confusion features as c and history features as h. Performance for the feature combinations bh is omitted for space; it is between b and bc."

        "The implemented state tracking methods are summarized in Table 2, and our results are presented in Table 3.",
        "These results suggest several conclusions.",
        "First, discriminative approaches for state tracking broadly outperform generative methods.",
        "Since discriminative methods incorporate many features and are trained directly to optimize performance, this is perhaps unsurprising for the MATCH conditions.",
        "It is interesting that discriminative methods are also superior in the more realistic MISMATCH setting, albeit with smaller gains.",
        "This result suggests that discriminative methods have good promise when deployed into real systems, where mismatch between training and test distributions is expected.",
        "Second, the dynamic discriminative DISCDYN models also outperformed the fixed-length discriminative methods.",
        "This shows the benefit of a model which can score every dialog state hypotheses, rather than a fixed subset.",
        "Third, the three variants of the DISCDYN model, which progressively contain more detailed feature encoding and conjunctions, perform similarly.",
        "This suggests that a relatively simple encoding is sufficient to achieve good performance, as the feature indicators and conjunctions present in DISCDYN2 and DISCDYN3 give only a small additional increase.",
        "Among the discriminative models, the jointly-optimized DISCDYN versions also slightly outperform the simpler, independently-optimized DISCIND version.",
        "This is to be expected, for two reasons: first, DISCIND is trained on a per-hypothesis basis, while the DISCDYN models are trained on a per-turn basis, which is the true performance metric.",
        "For example, some turns have 1 hypothesis and others have 100, but DISCIND training counts all hypotheses equally.",
        "Second, model parameters in DISCIND are trained independently of competing hypotheses.",
        "However, they should rather be adjusted specifically so that the correct item receives a larger score than incorrect items ?",
        "not merely to increase scores for correct items and decrease scores for incorrect items in isolation ?",
        "and this is what is done in the DISCDYN models.",
        "The analysis of various feature sets indicates that the ASR/SLU error correlation (confusion) features yield the largest improvement ?",
        "c.f.",
        "feature set bc compared to b in Table 3.",
        "The improvement is smallest for MISMATCH, which underscores the challenges of mismatched train and test conditions during a realistic runtime scenario.",
        "Note, however, that we have constructed a highly mismatched case where we train on DS1 (that supports just 8 routes) and test on DS2 (that supports 40 routes).",
        "Therefore, many route, origin and destination slot values in the test data do not appear in the training data.",
        "Hence, it is unsurprising that the positive effect of confusion features would decrease.",
        "While Table 3 shows performance measures averaged across all turns, Table 4 breaks down performance measures by slot, using the full feature set bch and the realistic MISMATCH dataset.",
        "Results here show a large variation in performance across the different slots.",
        "For the date and time slots, there is an order of magnitude less data than for the other slots; however performance for dates is quite good, whereas times is rather poor.",
        "We believe this is because the SLU confusion features can be estimated well for slots with small cardinalities (there are 7 possible values for the day), and less well for slots with large cardinalities (there are 24 ?",
        "60 = 1440 possible time values).",
        "This sug",
        "gests that the amount of data required to estimate a good model may depend on the cardinality of slot values.",
        "Finally, in Figure 4 we show how performance varies with different amounts of training data for the MATCH2 and MISMATCH datasets, where the full training set size is approximately 5600 and 4400 turns, respectively.",
        "In both cases asymptotic performance is reached after about 2000 turns, or about 150 dialogs.",
        "This is particularly encouraging, as it suggests models could be learned or adapted online with relatively little data, or could even be individually tailored to particular users."

        "Dialog state tracking is crucial to the successful operation of spoken dialog systems.",
        "Recently developed statistical approaches are promising as they fully utilize the dialog history, and can incorporate priors from past usage data.",
        "However, existing methodologies are either limited in their accuracy or their coverage, both of which hamper performance.",
        "In this paper, we have introduced a new model for discriminative state tracking.",
        "The key idea is to exploit the structure of the problem, in which each dialog state hypothesis has features drawn from the same set.",
        "In contrast to past approaches to discriminative state tracking which required a number of parameters quadratic in the number of state hypotheses, our approach uses a constant number of parameters, invariant to the number of state hypotheses.",
        "This is a crucial property that enables generalization and dealing with an unlimited number of hypotheses, overcoming a key limitation in previous models.",
        "We evaluated the proposed method and compared it to existing generative and discriminative approaches on a corpus of real-world human-computer dialogs chosen to include a mismatch between training and test, as this will be found in deployments.",
        "Results show that the proposed model exceeds both the accuracy and probability quality of all baselines when using the richest feature set, which includes information about common ASR confusions and dialog history.",
        "The model can be trained efficiently, i.e. only about 150 training dialogs are necessary.",
        "The next step is to incorporate this approach into a deployed dialog system, and use the estimated posterior over dialog states as input to the action selection process.",
        "In future, we also hope to explore unsupervised online adaptation, where the trained model can be updated as test data is processed."
