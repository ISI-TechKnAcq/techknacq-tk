        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of identifying the correct meaning of a word in context.",
        "As a basic semantic understanding task at the lexical level, WSD is a fundamental problem in natural language processing.",
        "It can be potentially used as a component in many applications, such as machine translation (MT) and information retrieval (IR).",
        "In recent years, driven by Senseval/Semeval workshops, WSD systems achieve promising performance.",
        "In the application of WSD to MT, research has shown that integrating WSD in appropriate ways significantly improves the performance of MT systems (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "In the application to IR, WSD can bring two kinds of benefits.",
        "First, queries may contain ambiguous words (terms), which have multiple meanings.",
        "The ambiguities of these query words can hurt retrieval precision.",
        "Identifying the correct meaning of the ambiguous words in both queries and documents can help improve retrieval precision.",
        "Second, query words may have tightly related meanings with other words not in the query.",
        "Making use of these relations between words can improve retrieval recall.",
        "Overall, IR systems can potentially benefit from the correct meanings of words provided by WSD systems.",
        "However, in previous investigations of the usage of WSD in IR, different researchers arrived at conflicting observations and conclusions.",
        "Some of the early research showed a drop in retrieval performance by using word senses (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Voorhees, 1993).",
        "Some other experiments observed improvements by integrating word senses in IR systems (Schu?tze and Pedersen, 1995; Gonzalo et al., 1998; Stokoe et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004).",
        "This paper proposes the use of word senses to improve the performance of IR.",
        "We propose an approach to annotate the senses for short queries.",
        "We incorporate word senses into the language modeling (LM) approach to IR (Ponte and Croft, 1998), and utilize sense synonym relations to further improve the performance.",
        "Our evaluation on standard TREC1 data sets shows that supervised WSD outperforms two other WSD baselines and significantly improves IR.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "Krovetz and Croft (1992) studied the sense matches between terms in query and the document collection.",
        "They concluded that the benefits of WSD in IR are not as expected because query words have skewed sense distribution and the collocation effect from other query terms already performs some disambiguation.",
        "Sanderson (1994; 2000) used pseudowords to introduce artificial word ambiguity in order to study the impact of sense ambiguity on IR.",
        "He concluded that because the effectiveness of WSD can be negated by inaccurate WSD performance, high accuracy of WSD is an essential requirement to achieve improvement.",
        "In another work, Gonzalo et al. (1998) used a manually sense annotated corpus, SemCor, to study the effects of incorrect disambiguation.",
        "They obtained significant improvements by representing documents and queries with accurate senses as well as synsets (synonym sets).",
        "Their experiment also showed that with the synset representation, which included synonym information, WSD with an error rate of 40%?50% can still improve IR performance.",
        "Their later work (Gonzalo et al., 1999) verified that part of speech (POS) information is discriminatory for IR purposes.",
        "Several works attempted to disambiguate terms in both queries and documents with the senses predefined in hand-crafted sense inventories, and then used the senses to perform indexing and retrieval.",
        "Voorhees (1993) used the hyponymy (?IS-A?)",
        "relation in WordNet (Miller, 1990) to disambiguate the polysemous nouns in a text.",
        "In her experiments, the performance of sense-based retrieval is worse than stem-based retrieval on all test collections.",
        "Her analysis showed that inaccurate WSD caused the poor results.",
        "Stokoe et al. (2003) employed a fine-grained WSD system with an accuracy of 62.1% to disambiguate terms in both the text collections and the queries in their experiments.",
        "Their evaluation on TREC collections achieved significant improvements over a standard term based vector space model.",
        "However, it is hard to judge the effect of word senses because of the overall poor performances of their baseline method and their system.",
        "Instead of using fine-grained sense inventory, Kim et al. (2004) tagged words with 25 root senses of nouns in WordNet.",
        "Their retrieval method maintained the stem-based index and adjusted the term weight in a document according to its sense matching result with the query.",
        "They attributed the improvement achieved on TREC collections to their coarse-grained, consistent, and flexible sense tagging method.",
        "The integration of senses into the traditional stem-based index overcomes some of the negative impact of disambiguation errors.",
        "Different from using predefined sense inventories, Schu?tze and Pedersen (1995) induced the sense inventory directly from the text retrieval collection.",
        "For each word, its occurrences were clustered into senses based on the similarities of their contexts.",
        "Their experiments showed that using senses improved retrieval performance, and the combination of word-based ranking and sense-based ranking can further improve performance.",
        "However, the clustering process of each word is a time consuming task.",
        "Because the sense inventory is collection dependent, it is also hard to expand the text collection without redoing preprocessing.",
        "Many studies investigated the expansion effects by using knowledge sources from thesauri.",
        "Some researchers achieved improvements by expanding the disambiguated query words with synonyms and some other information from WordNet (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Fang, 2008).",
        "The usage of knowledge sources from WordNet in document expansion also showed improvements in IR systems (Cao et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2010).",
        "The previous work shows that the WSD errors can easily neutralize its positive effect.",
        "It is important to reduce the negative impact of erroneous disambiguation, and the integration of senses into traditional term index, such as stem-based index, is a possible solution.",

        "The Chinese parts not only disambiguate senses, but also provide clues of connections among different words.",

        "In Table 2, the first four columns are the MAP scores of various methods on the TREC7, TREC8, RB03, and RB04 query sets, respectively.",
        "The column Comb shows the results on the union of the four test query sets.",
        "The first three rows list the results of the top three systems that participated in the corresponding tasks.",

        "The last column #ret-rel lists the total numbers of relevant documents retrieved by different methods.",

        "Comparing to the baseline method, all methods with sense integrated achieve consistent improvements on all query sets.",
        "The usage of the supervised WSD method outperforms the other two WSD baselines, and it achieves sta",
        "tistically significant improvements over Stemprf on TREC7, TREC8, and RB03.",
        "The integration of senses into the baseline method has two aspects of impact.",
        "First, the morphological roots of senses conquer the irregular inflection problem.",
        "Thus, the documents containing the irregular inflections are retrieved when senses are integrated.",
        "For example, in topic 326 {ferry sinkings}, the stem form of sinkings is sink.",
        "As sink is an irregular verb, the usage of senses improves the retrieval recall by retrieving the documents containing the inflection forms sunk, sank, and sunken.",
        "Second, the senses output by supervised WSD system help identify the meanings of query terms.",
        "Take topic 357 {territorial waters dispute} for example, the stem form of waters is water and its appropriate sense in this query should be water ??",
        "(body of water) instead of the most frequent sense of water ?",
        "(H2O).",
        "In Stemprf +WSD, we correctly identify the minority sense for this query term.",
        "In another example, topic 425 {counterfeiting money}, the stem form of counterfeiting is counterfeit.",
        "Although the most frequent sense counterfeit ??",
        "(not genuine) is not wrong, another sense counterfeit ??",
        "(forged money) is more accurate for this query term.",
        "The Chinese translation in the latter sense represents the meaning of the phrase in original query.",
        "Thus, Stemprf +WSD outperforms the other two methods on this query by assigning the highest probability for this sense.",
        "Overall, the performance of Stemprf +WSD is better than Stemprf +{MFS, Even} on 121 queries and 119 queries, respectively.",
        "The t-test at the confidence level of 99% indicates that the improvements are statistically significant.",
        "The results of expanding with synonym relations in the above three methods are shown in the last three rows, Stemprf +{MFS, Even, WSD}+Syn.",
        "The integration of synonym relations further improves the performance no matter what kind of sense tagging method is applied.",
        "The improvement varies with different methods on different query sets.",
        "As shown in the last column of Table 2, the number of relevant documents retrieved is increased for each method.",
        "Stemprf +Even+Syn retrieves more relevant documents than Stemprf +MFS+Syn, because the former method expands more senses.",
        "Overall, the improvement achieved by Stemprf +WSD+Syn is larger than the other two methods.",
        "It shows that the WSD technique can help choose the appropriate senses for synonym expansion.",
        "Among the different settings, Stemprf +WSD+Syn achieves the best performance.",
        "Its improvement over the baseline method is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level on RB04 and at the 99% confidence level on the other three query sets, with an overall improvement of 4.39%.",
