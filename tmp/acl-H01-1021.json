        "A number of techniques for “question answering” have recently been evaluated both in the TREC environment (Voorhees and Harman, 1999) and in the DARPA TIDES program.",
        "In the standard approach to information retrieval, relevant text documents are retrieved in response to a query.",
        "The parts of those documents that may contain the most useful information or even the actual answer to the query are typically indicated by highlighting occurrences of query words in the text.",
        "In contrast, the task of a question-answering system is to identify text passages containing the relevant information and, if possible, extract the actual answer to the query.",
        "Question answering has a long history in natural language processing, and Salton’s first book (Salton, 1968) contains a detailed discussion of the relationship between information retrieval and question-answering systems.",
        "The focus in recent research has been on extracting answers from very large text databases and many of the techniques use search technology as a major component.",
        "A significant number of the queries used in information retrieval experiments are questions, for example, TREC topic 338 “What adverse effects have people experienced while taking aspirin repeatedly?” and topic 308 “What are the advantages and/or disadvantages of tooth implants?” In question-answering experiments, the queries tend to be more restricted questions, where answers are likely to be found in a single text passage, for example, TREC question-answering question 11 “Who was President Cleveland’s wife?” and question 14 “What country is the biggest producer of Tungsten?” The TREC question-answering experiments have, to date, used only English text.",
        "As the first step towards our goal of cross-lingual question answering, we investigated whether the general approaches to question answering that have been used in English will also be effective for Chinese.",
        "Although it is now well known that statistical information retrieval techniques are effective in many languages, earlier research, such as Fujii and Croft (1993, 1999), was helpful in pointing out which techniques were particularly useful for languages like Japanese.",
        "This research was designed to provide similar information for question answering.",
        "In the next section, we describe the components of the Chinese question answering system (Marsha) and the algorithm used to determine answers.",
        "In section 3, we describe an evaluation of the system using queries obtained from Chinese students and the TREC-9 Chinese cross-lingual database (164,779 documents from the Peoples Daily and the Xing-Hua news agencies in the period 1991-1995)."

        "The Chinese question-answering system consists of three main components.",
        "These are the query processing module, the Hanquery search engine, and the answer extraction module.",
        "The query processing module recognizes known question types and formulates queries for the search engine.",
        "The search engine retrieves candidate texts from a large database.",
        "The answer extraction module identifies text passages that are likely to contain answers and extracts answers, if possible, from these passages.",
        "This system architecture is very similar to other question-answering systems described in the literature.",
        "More specifically, the query processing module carries out the following steps: (1) The query is matched with templates to decide the question type and the “question words” in the query.",
        "We define 9 question types.",
        "Most of these correspond to typical named entity classes used in information extraction systems.",
        "For each question type, there are one or more templates.",
        "Currently there are 170 templates.",
        "If more than one template matches the question, we pick the longest match.",
        "For example, a question may include“i ilk” (how many dollars).",
        "Then both (how many dollars) and 1 i` (how many) will match the question.",

        "We used 51 queries to do the initial evaluation of the question-answering system.",
        "We selected 26 queries from 240 questions collected from Chinese students in our department, because only these had answers in the test collection.",
        "The other 25 queries were constructed by either reformulating a question or asking a slightly different question.",
        "For example, given the question “which city is the biggest city in China?” we also generated the questions “where is the biggest city in China?” and “which city is the biggest city in the world?”.",
        "The results for these queries were evaluated in a similar, but not identical way to the TREC question-answering track.",
        "An “answer” in this system corresponds to the 50 byte responses in TREC and passages are approximately equivalent to the 250 byte TREC responses.",
        "For 33 of 51 queries, the system suggested answers.",
        "24 of the 33 were correct.",
        "For these 24, the “reciprocal rank” is 1, since only the top ranked passage is used to extract answers.",
        "Restricting the answer extraction to the top ranked passage also means that the other 27 queries have reciprocal rank values of 0.",
        "In TREC, the reciprocal ranks are calculated using the highest rank of the correct answer (up to 5).",
        "In our case, using only the top passage means that the mean reciprocal rank of 0.47 is a lower bound for the result of the 50 byte task.",
        "As an example, the question “95 ” (Which city is the biggest city in China?",
        "), the answer returned is (Shanghai).",
        "In the top ranked passage, “China” and “Shanghai” are the two answer candidates that have the smallest distances.",
        "“Shanghai” is chosen as the final answer since “China” appears in the original question.",
        "As an example of an incorrect response, the question “ A�” (In which year did Jun Xie defeat a Russian player and win the world chess championship for the first time?)",
        "produced an answer of (today).",
        "There were two candidate answers in the top passage, “October 18” and “today”.",
        "Both were marked as DATE by Identifinder, but “today” was closer to the matching words.",
        "This indicates the need for more date normalization and better entity classification in the system.",
        "For 44 queries, the correct answer was found in the top-ranked passage.",
        "Even if the other queries are given a reciprocal rank of 0, this gives a mean reciprocal rank of 0.86 for a task similar to the 250 byte TREC task.",
        "In fact, the correct answer for 4 other queries was found in the top 5 passages, so the mean reciprocal rank would be somewhat higher.",
        "For 2 of the remaining 3 queries, Hanquery did not retrieve a document in the top 10 that contained an answer, so answer extraction could not work."

        "These results, although preliminary, are promising.",
        "We have made a number of improvements in the new version (v2) of the system.",
        "Some of these are described in this section.",
        "One of the changes is designed to improve the system’s ability to extract answers for the questions that ask for a number.",
        "A number recognizer was developed to recognize numbers in Chinese documents.",
        "The numbers here are numbers other than DATE, MONEY and PERCENTAGE that are recognized by IdentiFinder.",
        "The version of IdentiFinder used in our system can only mark up seven types of name entities and this limits the system’s ability to answer other types of questions.",
        "The number recognizer is the first example of the type of refinement to named entity recognition that must be done for better performance.",
        "An example of a question requiring a numeric answer is: ti I5 JL (� � Q P “?",
        "(What is the number of Clinton’s presidency?)”.",
        "This question could be answered in Marsha v2 by extracting the marked up number from the best passage in the answer extraction part, while Marsha v1 could only return the top 5 passages that were likely to have the answer to this question.",
        "Another improvement relates to the best matching window of a passage.",
        "The size of the matching window in each passage is an important part of calculating the belief score for the passage.",
        "Locating the best matching window is also important in the answer-extraction processing because the final answer picked is the candidate that has the smallest average distance from the matching window.",
        "The best matching window of a passage here is the window that has the most query words in it and has the smallest window size.",
        "In the previous version of our system, we only consider the first occurrence of each query word in a passage and index the position accordingly.",
        "The matching window is thus from the word of the smallest index to the word of the largest index in the passage.",
        "It is only a rough approximation of the best matching window though it works well for many of the passages.",
        "In the second version of Marsha, we developed a more accurate algorithm to locate the best matching window of each passage.",
        "This change helped Marsha v2 find correct answers for some questions that previously failed.",
        "The following is an example of such a question.",
        "For the question “X Q ',,� N a t� T nJ A F1 P, i`?",
        "(How many people in the United States are below the poverty line?",
        ")” The best passage is as follows: This passage has two occurrences of query word “) U ”.",
        "In v1, the first occurrence of “)� Q” is treated as the start of the matching window, whereas the second occurrence is actually the start of the best matching window.",
        "There are two numbers “ 2 0 0 �� )j” (more than 2 million) and “ 3 T7” (33.585 million) in the passage.",
        "The right answer “ 3 3 5 8 .",
        "5 rj” (33.585 million) is nearer to the best matching window and “ 2 0 0 1� T7 ” (more than 2 million) is nearer to the estimated matching window.",
        "Therefore, the right answer can be extracted after correctly locating the best matching window.",
        "The third improvement is with the scoring strategies of passages.",
        "Based on the observation that the size of the best matching window of a passage plays a more important role than the order of the query words in a passage, we adjusted the score bonus for same order satisfaction from 0.5 to 0.05.",
        "This adjustment makes a passage with a smaller matching window get a higher belief score than a passage that satisfies the same order of query words but has a bigger matching window.",
        "As an example, consider the question: ?",
        "(Who was the first president in Passage 1 is the passage that has the right answer“ 4+9�”.",
        "the United States?",
        ")”.",
        "matching words in the same sentence, and whether the matching words in the passage have the same order as they are in the question are common to LASSO and Marsha.",
        "Passage 1 and Passage 2 both have all query words.",
        "The size of the best matching window in Passage 1 is smaller than that in Passage 2 while query words in Passage 2 have the same order as that in the question.",
        "The scoring strategy in Marsha v2 selects Passage 1 and extracts the correct answer while Marsha v1 selected Passage 2.",
        "Special processing of ordinals has also been considered in Marsha v2.",
        "Ordinals in Chinese usually start with the Chinese character \"\" and are followed by a cardinal.",
        "It is better to retain ordinals as single words during the query generation in order to retrieve better relevant documents.",
        "However, the cardinals (part of the ordinals in Chinese) in a passage are marked up by the number recognizer for they might be answer candidates for questions asking for a number.",
        "Thus ordinals in Chinese need special care in a QA system.",
        "In Marsha v2, ordinals appearing in a question are first retained as single words for the purpose of generating a good query and then separated in the post processing after relevant documents are retrieved to avoid answer candidates being ignored."

        "For example: Question: \"Who is the author of \"Bad Bad Leroy Brown\" Inquery query: #sum( #uw8(author Bad Bad Leroy Brown) #6(Bad Bad Leroy Brown)) Where N is number of terms + 1 for named entities, and number of terms + 2 for quoted phrases.",
        "If a query retrieves no documents, a “back off” query uses #sum over the query terms, with phrases dropped.",
