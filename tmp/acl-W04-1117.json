        "The basic assumption of Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1976;1977; Fillmore & Atkins 1992; Petruck 1996) as it applies to the description of lexical meanings is that each word (in a given meaning) evokes a particular frame and possibly profiles some element or aspect of that frame.",
        "By being linked to frames, each word is directly connected with other words in its frame(s).",
        "where word dependence association are needed from surface syntactic structures which actually reflect the grammatical relationship to the deep semantics structure whereby semantic content are put into natural language.",
        "The meaning of a word, in most cases, is best demonstrated by reference to a semantic network.",
        "Referential meaning on its own is insufficient.",
        "Word meaning would include the other dimensions concerning the structure and function of words.",
        "Unlike English, in which there are two major types of evidence that help to determine the syntactic structure of a phrase or sentence: morphological information and distributional information (such as word order) , in Chinese the lack of conclusive morphological cues makes ambiguity analyses for one sentence more likely.",
        "Moreover, most Chinese sentences order are very flexible.",
        "Phrase omission, word movement, ellipsis and binding also make it difficult to characterize their grammatical relation.",

        "We started from an initial analysis based on the surface syntactics, then we analyzed deep semantic relationships, and attempted to improve it by removing the semantic order from the syntactic structure and reconnecting them in different places.",
        "Since many word phrase patterns are difficult for computers to recognize, trying to compromise between linguistic correctness and engineering convenience, we link the difference semantic roles on the flat level, while employing a few template rules.",

        "They are non-hierarchical constructs.",
        "This flatted representation allows access to various levels of syntactic description tree simultaneously.",

        "We manually tagged two kind of relationship among our large-scale frameworks: 1. syntax-semantic relationship; 2. semantic feature relationship.",
        "Our framework consists of a set of nodes and a set of arcs that join the nodes, with each word or concept corresponding to a node and links between any two nodes that are directly associated.",
        "The basic links in the framework are between one word item to another based on immediate semantic deperdency order.",

        "The feature of relationship between two nodes are labeled on the arc.",
        "We developed the first fully instantiated semantic structure by manually labeling semantic representations in a machine-readable format.",
