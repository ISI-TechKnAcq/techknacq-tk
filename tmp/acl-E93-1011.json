        "We introduce a method of disambiguation which relies on a very simple idea : whenever LEXTER has to choose among several competing noun subgroups in order to disambiguate a maximal-length noun phrase, it checks each of these subgroups if it occurs anywhere else in the corpus in a non-ambiguous situation, and then it makes a choice.",

        "LEXTER performs a grammatical analysis of this corpus and yields a list of noun phrases which are likely to be terminological units, representing the concepts of the subject field.",
        "This list together with the corpus it has been extracted from is then passed on to an expert for validation by the means of a terminological hypertext web.",
        "LEXTER has been developped in an industrial context, in the Research and Development Division of Electricitd de France.",

        "We are integrating LEXTER in a text analysis tool to aid knowledge acquisition in the framework of Knowledge-Based System construction.",
        "This tool (LEXTER-K) will propose a structured list of candidate terms, rather than a flat list, which could be considered as a first coarse-grained modelisation of the information conveyed by the texts under analysis.",
        "Structuring of the terminology will be performed in two ways : on the one hand, by a structural analysis of the terminological noun phrases extracted by LEXTER; on the other hand, by an analysis of the sentences in which the candidate terms occur.",
        "This analysis will focus on the most relevant terms, determined by a statistical processing based on the assumption that the most frequent terms are probably the most relevant.",
        "We plan a two-stage architecture for LEXTER-K, that is, (1) the extraction of the terminology of the subject field, by a robust grammatical analysis (LEXTER), (2) the syntactic analysis of the sentences by a parser using this terminology.",
        "The syntactic structures of the sentences in a text, and the syntactic structures of the terminological units have to be placed on two different organisational levels.",
        "As the terminological unit is a semantic unit, it should be treated as such on the syntactic level, as well.",
        "Dissociating these two",
        "analysis, though one taking advantages of the results given by the other, will guarantee a better efficiency for the parser, in particular by limiting the combinatory explosion of structural ambiguities.",
        "It is well known that Natural Language systems usually require considerable knowledge acquisition, especially in building a specifically oriented field vocabulary in the case of systems which have to analyse technical texts.",
        "We think that this two-stage analysis (extracting the terminology of the domain with a robust superficial analysis, and analysing the texts with a more in-depth parser using this terminology), may lighten the expensive burden of hand-coding a specialized language and may lead to more generic and domain-independant Natural Language systems.",
        "As long as the terminology extracted during the first step has not been validated by an expert, as is now the case, and it directly feeds the syntactic analyser, this two-stage architecture requires a better quality of the terminology extracted by LEXTER.",
        "This is the reason why we tried to improve the precision rate in the detection of the terminological noun phrases by implementing an efficient strategy for structural noun phrase disambiguation.",

        "In this section, we briefly describe the type of grammatical analysis performed by LEXTER to extract likely terminological units and show what kind of disambiguation LEXTER has to perform.",
        "As we already pointed out, LEXTER has been achieved in an industrial context; from the beginning of the project, we had decided to focus upon a strongly restrictive criterium : applying and testing the system over a wide range of texts.",
        "The texts to be analysed are unrestricted texts gathered in large corpora.",
        "We had then to choose a fast and well-proved method.",
        "Moreover, we argued that, given the restricted grammatical structures of complex terminological units, it was not necessary to go into a complete syntactic analysis of the sentences to extract the terminology from a corpus (Bourigault, 1992b).",
        "First, a morphological analyser tags the texts, using a large lexical database and rules of lexical disambiguation.",
        "LEXTER treats texts in which each word is tagged with a grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).",
        "LEXTER works in two main phases : (1) splitting and (2) parsing.",
        "(1) At the splitting stage, LEXTER takes advantage of \"negative\" knowledge about the form of",
        "terminological units, by identifying those string level patterns which never go to make up these units and which can thus be considered as potential terminological limits.",
        "Such patterns are made up by, say, conjugated verbs, pronouns, conjonctions, certain strings of preposition + determiner.",
        "The splitting module is thus set up with a base of about 60 rules for identifying frontier markers, which it uses to split the texts.",
        "The splitting phase produces a series of text sequences, most often noun phrases.",
        "These noun phrases may well be likely terminological units themselves, but more often than not, they contain subgroups which are also likely units.",
        "That is why it is preferable at the splitting stage to refer to the noun phrases identified as \"maximal-length noun phrases\".",
        "Here is an example of a real maximal-length noun",
        "(2) At the parsing stage, LEXTER parses the maximal-length noun phrases (henceforth MLNP) in order to generate sub-groups, in addition to the MLNP, which are likely terminological units by virtue of their grammatical structure and their position in the MLNP.",
        "The LEXTER parsing module is made up of parsing rules which indicate which subgroups to extract from a MLNP on the basis of grammatical structure.",
        "Some of the MLNP structures are non-ambiguous : given such a structure it can be stated with a very high rate of certainty (Bourigault 1992a) that only one parsing is valid.",
        "The corresponding parsing rules are called non-ambiguous rules.",
        "For example, structure (1) is non-ambiguous, and parsing rule [a] is a non-ambiguous rule.",
        "Some of the MLNP structures are ambiguous, that is, given such a structure it cannot be stated with a sufficient rate of certainty that only one parsing is valid.",
        "Several substructures compete.",
        "The corresponding ambiguous parsing rules generate several competing subgroups.",
        "For example, when information about gender or number agreement are not available or of no help, structure (2) is ambiguous, that is, either",
        "the adjective attaches the head nounl of the noun subgroup nounl prep noun2, or it attaches noun2, constituting the noun subgroup (noun2 adj); the competing noun subgroups (nounl prep noun2) and (noun2 adj) will be generated by the ambiguous parsing rule [b].",
        "Structure (3) and parsing rule [c] are other examples of ambiguous structure and rule.",
        "The issue is how to disambiguate in cases of MLNP with ambiguous structures, that means, whenever an ambiguous rule applies, how to choose among the competing generated subgroups.",

        "Given an ambiguous MLNP, systematically keeping (all) the competing sub-group(s) detected elsewhere in the corpus in a non-ambiguous situation is not a satisfying principle of disambiguation.",
        "We need more precise rules of disambiguation.",
        "For example, for each of the parsing rules [b] and [c], in more than 20 % of the cases on our test corpus (see top left cells of Table 2 and Table 3), both competing subgroups have been non-ambiguously detected.",
        "That means that both subgroups are attested valid noun phrases as such.",
        "However, only one of them corresponds to a correct parsing of the MLNP they have been extracted from.",
        "In these cases keeping both subgroups would alter the precision rate since one of them is not grammatically valid.",
        "On the contrary, generating none of them would alter the recall rate.",
        "We chose to build a set of disambiguation rules for each of the ambiguous parsing rules.",
        "To work out the disambiguation rules, we adopted an empirical approach based on large-scale corpus experimentation.",
        "For each of the ambiguous structures, we examined all the different situations of disambiguation (only one, more than one, all the competing subgroups non-ambiguously detected) and for each of them, we parsed by hand a significative number of ambiguous noun phrases extracted from a reference test corpus.",
        "Applied to the ambiguous parsing rules [b] and [c], this approach led us to the following set of disambiguation rules (see Table 2 and Table 3) : • where both competing subgroups have been non-ambiguously detected, we checked that most often (125 cases/141 for rule [IA, 50 cases/52 for rule [c]) the correct parsing isolates the second sub-group,noun2 adj for rule [b], noun2 prep noun3 for rule [c] (see the top left cells of Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "• where only the second subgroup has been non-ambiguously detected, it always corresponds to the correct parsing and so it is systematically kept (see the top right cells of Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "• parsing rules [b] and [c] differs for the situations",
        "where only the first subgroup (nounl prep noun2 for both rules) has been non-ambiguously detected.",
        "For rule [b], this subgroup is kept since it most often corresponds to a correct parsing of the MLNP (175 cases/190, see the bottom left cell of Table 2).",
        "On the contrary, for rule [c], no systematic rule can be stated since the correct parsing sometimes isolates this non-ambiguously detected sub-group, but often isolates the second one (noun2 prep noun3), altough it appears nowhere else in the corpus in a non-ambiguous situation (see the bottom left cell of Table 3).",
        "This mainly happens in cases of \"elliptical denominations\", that is, a concept is first designated in a text by a \"complete\" term (for example, CIRCUIT D'ASPERSION D'ENCEINTE), and then is systematically refered to with an \"elliptical\" term (for example, CIRCUIT D'ASPERSION).",
        "The results we obtained with such sets of desambiguation rules (see Table 4) are satisfactory and show that the strategy described in this paper is efficient.",
