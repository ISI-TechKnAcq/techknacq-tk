        "In support to the on going project of Multilingual * Supported by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, Jakarta, Indonesia Machine Translation Sytem for Asian Language organized by Center forintemational Cooperation in Computerization (CICC)-Japan and other Asian countries (China,Indonesia,Malaysia and Thailand), we developed BIAS : an analysis program for Indonesian language which output an interlingual representation.",
        "By incorporating interlingual analysis technology, we will be able to include BIAS as part of multi-language translation system in a very effective way.",
        "This paper describes the design consideration of BIAS from the view point of linguistic theories and knowledge representation formalism.",
        "The design is based on an interlingual approach to machine translation which accepts input sentences in one language and produces sentences in other languages [Figure IL In particular BIAS is a program that takes natural language text as input and produces its underlying interlingual representation at a certain level of details that serve as a language-independent representation for the machine translation environment.",
        "The approach which being used here is an approximation of basic linguistic theories such as Chomsky's Standard Theory [Chomsky,65],Case Grammar [Fillmore, 67] and Definite Clause Grammar [Pereira,80].",
        "We also incorporates theuse of appropriate representation formalism such as Frames [Minsky,8 I 1 and Semantic Network [Quillian,68] for a suitable type of reasoning system.",
        "It is noted that eventhough there are many knowledge representation languages which arc theoretically sufficient to describe any natural language, they need to be modified in their theory and implementation for a particular language such as Bahasa hidonesia.",
        "The existence of various theories and knowledge representation techniques lead us to consider several models of reasoning formalism.",
        "This in turn may serve as an indicator to the expressive adequacy of our chosen representation.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "Its most cases, these analyzers separate the syntactic and semantic parts of the analysis into separate consecutive stages, paying much more attention to the syntactic part at the expense of semantic [Gershans,82].",
        "At the other end are the analyzers that skim through the text looking for certain types of information andpaying attention only to the words and expression relevant to the task [DeJong,791.",
        "This approach is very effective and intuitively corresponds to what people do while skimming newspaper stories.",
        "However, the danger in this approach lies in the possibilty of misunderstanding what is being stated.",
