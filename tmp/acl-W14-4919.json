        "Diagnostic accuracy is critical for both physicians and patients, but there is insufficient training on clinical decision-making strategy in medical schools, towards avoiding diagnostic error (Graber et al., 2012; Croskerry & Norman, 2008).",
        "Berner and Graber (2008) estimate that diagnostic error in medicine occurs at a rate of 5-15%, and that two-thirds of diagnostic errors involve cognitive root causes.",
        "The dual process model distinguishes between intuitive and analytic modes of reasoning (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Evans, 1989).",
        "Use of the intuitive system, while efficient, may lead to cognitive errors based on heuristics and biases (Graber, 2009).",
        "Croskerry (2003) distinguished over 30 such biases and heuristics that underlie diagnostic error, including anchoring, base-rate neglect, and hindsight bias.",
        "Hammond's (1981) Cognitive Continuum Theory proposes that decision-making lies on a continuum from intuitive to analytical reasoning.",
        "Intuitive reasoning is described as rapid, unconscious, moderately accurate, and employing simultaneous use of cues and pattern recognition (Hammond, 1981).",
        "Analytical decision-making is described as slow, conscious, task-specific, more accurate, making sequential use of cues, and applying logical rules (Hammond, 1996).",
        "Much reasoning is quasirational: between the two poles of purely intuitive and purely analytical decision-making (Hamm, 1988; Hammond, 1981).",
        "Cader et al. (2005) suggested that cognitive continuum theory is appropriate for the evaluation of decision-making in medical contexts.",
        "The current study links to another work (Hochberg et al., 2014), where the cognitive continuum was applied to physician decision-making in dermatology.",
        "Decision style was manually assessed in physician verbalizations during medical image inspection.",
        "Figure 1 shows the 4-point annotation scheme, ranging from intuitive to analytical; the two intermediate points on the scale reflect the presence of both styles, with intuitive (BI) or analytical (BA) reasoning more prevalent.",

        "The narratives were produced by different physicians for the same image case (left, used with permission from Logical Images, Inc.), and all four physicians were correct in their final diagnosis.",
        "(Confidence mentions were removed in narratives presented to annotators, to avoid any potential bias.)",
        "This work describes computational modeling for automatic annotation of decision style using this annotated dataset, on the basis of linguistic, speaker, and image case features.",
        "1.1 Contributions To date, this appears to be the first study attempting to computationally predict physician decision style.",
        "Similar to the case of affect, automatic annotation of decision style can be characterized as a subjective natural language processing problem (Alm, 2011).",
        "This adds special challenges to the modeling process.",
        "Accordingly, this work details a thorough process for moving from manual to automatic annotation.",
        "This study contributes to cognitive psychology, annotation methodology, and clinical computational linguistic analysis.",
        "Methodologically, the study details a careful process for selecting and labeling manually annotated data for modeling in the realm of subjective natural language phenomena, thus addressing the need for their characterization (Alm, 2011).",
        "Theoretically, acceptable annotator reliability on decision style, along with successful computational modeling, will lend construct validity to the dual process model.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, the identification of discriminative features for intuitive and analytical reasoning provides a springboard for further studying decision-making using language as a cognitive sensor.",
        "Practically, prediction of decision style would also be useful for determining whether individuals are using the appropriate style for a particular task, based on analyses linking decision style to task performance.",
        "Importantly, detection of decision style from observable linguistic behaviors allows for objective measurement that avoids biases present in self-report surveys (Sj?oberg, 2003; Allinson & Hayes, 1996).",
        "130 2 Data and Manual Decision Style Annotation The annotated corpus used in this study was introduced in Hochberg et al. (2014), which also discusses the manual annotation scheme and annotator strategies in greater detail.",
        "For clarity, the dataset and annotation scheme are described here briefly.",
        "The dataset consisted of spoken narratives collected from 29 physicians as they examined 30 clinical images of dermatological cases, for a total of 867 1 narratives.",
        "Physicians described their reasoning process as they advanced towards a diagnosis, and they also estimated their confidence 2 in their final diagnosis.",
        "Narratives were assessed for correctness (based on final diagnoses) and image cases were evaluated for difficulty by a practicing dermatologist.",
        "3 For the manual annotation of decision style, anonymized text transcripts of the narratives were presented to two annotators with graduate training in cognitive psychology.",
        "4 Analytical reasoning considers more alternatives in greater detail.",
        "Thus, it was expected to be associated with longer narratives, as Figure 1 illustrates.",
        "Therefore, annotators were asked not to use length as a proxy for decision style.",
        "Narratives were randomized to ensure high-quality annotation, and 10% of narratives were duplicated to measure intra-annotator reliability.",
        "For analysis, primary ratings were used, and secondary ratings (on duplicated narratives) were used to measure intra-annotator consistency.",
        "The kappa scores and proportion agreement, detailed below, motivate the labeling and data selection process used for classification and modeling in this work.",
        "Figure 2 shows the distribution of annotation labels for both annotators, respectively, for the whole dataset, on the original 4-point scale.",
        "In comparison, Figure 3 shows the annotators?",
        "distributions across a collapsed 2-point scale of intuitive vs. analytical, where, for each annotator, narratives labeled BI were assigned to I and those labeled BA assigned to A.",
        "Figure 2: The distribution of ratings among the decision-making spectrum, on a 4-point scale.",
        "Figure 3: The distribution of ratings among the decision-making spectrum, on a 2-point scale.",
        "Annotator agreement was well above chance for both the 4-point (Figure 4) and 2-point (Figure 5) scales.",
        "Notably, the annotators were in full agreement or agreed within one rating for over 90% of narratives on the original 4-point scale.",
        "This pattern of variation reveals both the fuzziness of the categories and also that the subjective perception of decision-making style is systematic.",
        "Annotator agreement was also assessed via linear weighted kappa scores (Cohen, 1968).",
        "As shown in Figure 6, inter-annotator reliability was moderate, and intra-annotator reliability was moderate (Annota- tor 2) to good (Annotator 1); see Landis and Koch (1977) and Altman (1991).",
        "Since both proportion agreement and kappa scores were slightly higher for the 2-point scale, the automatic annotation modeling discussed below used this binary scale.",
        "In addition, the distribution of 1 One narrative was excluded due to extreme brevity, and two physicians each skipped an image during data collection.",
        "2 For consistency, this paper uses the term confidence, treated as interchangeable with certainty and similar synonymous expressions used by clinicians in the medical narratives, such as sure, certain, confident, just certainty percentages, etc.",
        "3 Some imperfections may occur in the data, e.g., in transcriptions, difficulty ratings, or annotations (or in extracted features).",
        "4 Annotator instructions included decision style definitions, a description of the 4-point scale and example narratives.",
        "Annotators were asked to focus on decision style as present in the text rather than speculate beyond it.",

        "2.1 Data Selection and Labeling for Computational Modeling This section details the systematic method used to select data for model development.",
        "The goal of the work was to develop a computational model that could automatically annotate narratives as intuitive or analytical, based on lexical, speech, disfluency, physician demographic, cognitive, and diagnostic difficulty features.",
        "The study employed a supervised learning approach, and since no real ground truth was available, it relied on manual annotation of each narrative for decision style.",
        "However, annotators did not always agree on the labels, as discussed above.",
        "Thus, strategies were developed to label narratives, including in the case of disagreement (Figure 7).",
        "The dataset used for modeling consisted of 672 narratives.",
        "5 Annotators were in full agreement for 614 ratings on the binary scale of intuitive vs. analytical (Figure 8).",
        "6 Next, 49 narratives were assigned a binary label based on the center of gravity of both annotators?",
        "primary ratings (Figure 9).",
        "For example, if a narrative was rated as Intuitive and Both-Analytical by Annotators 1 and 2, respectively, the center of gravity was at Both-Intuitive, resulting in an Intuitive label.",
        "Finally, 9 narratives were labeled using the annotators?",
        "secondary ratings, 7 available for 10% of narratives, to resolve annotator disagreement.",
        "8 5 Within a reasonable time frame, the text data are expected to be made publicly available.",
        "6 Excluding also narratives lacking confidence or correctness information.",
        "7 Collected to measure intra-annotator reliability.",
        "8 For example, if the primary ratings of Annotator 1 and Annotator 2 were Both-Analytical and Both-Intuitive, respectively, but both annotators?",
        "secondary ratings were intuitive (e.g., Both-Intuitive or Intuitive), the narrative was labeled Intuitive.",
        "132 Narratives with disagreements that could not be resolved in these ways were excluded.",
        "As perception of decision-making style is subject to variation in human judgment, this work focused on an initial modeling of data which represent the clearer-cut cases of decision style (rather than the disagreement gray zone on this gradient perception continuum).",
        "From the perspective of dealing with a subjective problem, this approach enables an approximation of ground truth, as a validation concept.",
        "9 Figure 7: Narrative labeling pipeline.",
        "614 narratives were labeled due to full binary agreement, and center-of-gravity and secondary rating strategies were used to label an additional 58 narratives for which annotators were not in agreement.",
        "Figure 8: Demonstration of initial corpus labeling, in which 614 narratives were labeled on the basis of binary agreement.",
        "Figure 9: Demonstration of center-of-gravity strategy, used to label an additional 49 narratives.",

        "Diagnostic Correctness and Decision Style Using the 672 narratives selected for modeling, Table 1 shows the relationship of physicians?",
        "diagnostic correctness by decision style (intuitive vs. analytical on a binary scale).",
        "Correct Incorrect Total Intuitive 158 186 344 Analytical 106 222 328 Total 264 408 672 Table 1: Distribution of diagnostic correctness by decision style.",
        "Overall, there was a slightly higher prevalence of intuitive reasoning, and there were more incorrect than correct diagnoses.",
        "10 Table 1 also suggests a relationship between correctness and decision-making style, where for correct diagnoses, intuitive reasoning was more dominant.",
        "The opposite trend held for incorrect diagnoses: analytical reasoning was more frequent.",
        "Indeed, a chi-square test revealed a significant relationship between correctness and decision style, ?",
        "2 (1, N = 672) = 13.05, p < 0.01.",
        "This pattern is in line with claims that intuitive reasoning is linked to better performance when much information is to be processed; mechanisms of intuitive reasoning and pattern recognition allow individuals to overcome the limitations of their working memory (Evans, 2008).",
        "However, others have linked intuitive reasoning to decreased diagnostic accuracy, as intuitive reasoning may be prey to inappropriate 9 Modeling of fuzzier, hard to label data, is left to future work.",
        "One possible approach is to learn the labels by using a k-nearest neighbor classifier, which identifies the most similar narratives and uses their labels to make the prediction.",
        "10 Contributing factors to the proportion of incorrect diagnoses might include case difficulty levels in the experimental sce-nario, and that physicians did not have access to additional information, such as patient history or follow-up tests.",
        "133 heuristics and biases (Croskerry, 2003).",
        "Viewed from the perspective of cognitive continuum theory, the higher prevalence of incorrect diagnoses may be due to the use of decision styles that were not suited to the task demands of the particular case (Hammond, 1981).",
        "Finally, it might be the case that diagnostic difficulty was a moderating variable, where physicians preferred intuitive reasoning for less challenging cases, and analytical reasoning for more difficult cases.",
        "3 Methods A model was developed for the binary prediction case (intuitive vs. analytical), since the 2-point rating scheme had slightly higher annotator agreement (see Section 2).",
        "Model development and analysis were performed using the WEKA data mining software package (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "The dataset was split into 80% development and 20% final test sets (Table 2).",

        "Thus, the testing data will represent different physicians, but the styles themselves have been captured by the training data so that they can be correctly classified; the same rationale can be applied to image cases.",
        "To further investigate the phenomenon and identify the degree of inter- and intra-individual variation in decision style, future work could experiment with holding out particular images and physicians.",
        "12 In Section 4.1, parameters were tuned for each case of feature combinations in a similar way.",
        "134 idated, researched dictionaries (Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010).",
        "Disfluency features were silent pauses, and the frequency of fillers and nonfluencies as computed by LIWC.",
        "Speech features are in Table 3.",
        "Besides linguistic features, three additional groups of features were included, with an eye towards application.",
        "Demographic features were gender and professional status, while cognitive features were physician confidence in diagnosis and correctness of the final diagnosis.",
        "Difficulty features consisted of an expert-assigned rank of diagnostic case difficulty, and the percent of correct diagnoses given by physicians for each image, calculated on the development data only.",
        "In an instructional system, a trainee could input a demographic profile, and the system could also collect performance data over time, while also taking into account stored information on case difficulty when available.",
        "This information could then be used in modeling of decision style in spoken or written diagnostic narratives.",
        "3.2 Feature Selection WEKA's CfsSubsetEval, an attribute evaluator, was used for feature selection, 13 using 10-fold cross-validation on the development set only.",

        "intensity, and difficulty: percent correctness/image.",
        "Feature selection, using the same attribute evaluator, was also performed on only the lexical fea-tures, which could be a starting point for analysis of decision-making style in text-only data.",
        "The best lexical features 14 included conjunctions, cause, cognitive process, inclusion, exclusion, and perception words.",
        "These lexical items seem associated with careful examination and reasoning, which might be more present in analytical decision-making and less present in intuitive decision-making.",
        "Some cate-gories, especially inclusion (e.g., with, and), exclusion (e.g., but, either, unless), and cause words (e.g., affect, cause, depend, therefore), seem particularly good representatives of logical reasoning and justifi-cation, a key feature of analytical reasoning.",
        "But as shown in the next section, when available, speech and disfluency information is useful, and potentially more so than some lexical features.",

        "In addition, most decision style ratings on the 4-point scale were in the distribution center (Figure 2), so the binary labels used in the study only partially reflect purely intuitive or purely analytical reasoning.",
        "However, since clinician reasoning in the current dataset can be reliably measured by human and computational classification, linguistic features of decision style must be present.",
        "Finally, the LIWC software used for lexical features matches surface strings rather than senses; future work might operate on the sense rather than token level.",
