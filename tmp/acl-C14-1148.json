        "To make matters worse, almost all TSF systems to date (except Garrido et al. (2013)) use neither the BEFORE START* nor AFTER END* labels in their intermediate temporal relationships classification models, even though high-confidence instances with those labels could prevent the sort of erroneous WITHIN labels alluded to above.",
