        "This process has been named sentence planning (Ram-bow and Korelsky, 1992).",
        "Broadly speaking, it involves aggregating content into sentence-sized units, and then selecting the lexical and syntactic elements that are used in realizing each sentence.",
        "Here, we consider this second process.",
        "The challenge lies in integrating constraints from syntax, semantics and pragmatics.",
        "Although most generation systems pipeline decisions (Reiter, 1994), we believe the most efficient and flexible way to integrate constraints in sentence planning is to synchronize the decisions.",
        "In this paper, we provide a natural framework for dealing with interactions and ensuring contextually appropriate output in a single pass.",

        "We combine LTAG syntax with declarative specifications of semantics and pragmatics of words and constructions, so that we can build the syntax and semantics of sentences simultaneously.",
        "To drive this process, we take description as the paradigm for sentence planning.",
        "Our planner, SPUD (Sentence Planner Using Descriptions), takes in a collection of goals to achieve in describing an event or state in the world; SPUD incrementally and recursively applies lexical specifications to determine which entities to describe and what information to include about them.",
        "Our system is unique in the streamlined organization of the grammar, and in its evaluation both of contextual appropriateness of pragmatics and of descriptive adequacy of semantics.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",

        "Moreover, selecting alternatives on the basis of their syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic contributions to the sentence using TAG allows the sentence planner to choose words in tandem with appropriate syntax (Yang et al., 1991), in a flexible order (Elhadad and Robin, 1992), and, if necessary, in conventional combinations (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Wanner, 1994)."
