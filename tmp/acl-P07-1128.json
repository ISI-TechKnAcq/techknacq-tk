        "Recent advances in multimedia technologies have led to huge archives of audio-video recordings of multiparty conversations in a wide range of areas including clinical use, online video sharing services, and meeting capture and analysis.",
        "While it is straightforward to replay such recordings, finding information from the often lengthy archives is a more challenging task.",
        "Annotating implicit semantics to enhance browsing and searching of recorded conversational speech has therefore posed new challenges to the field of multimedia information retrieval.",
        "reasons: First, empirical analysis has shown that annotating transcripts with semantic information (e.g., topics) enables users to browse and find information from multimedia archives more efficiently (Baner-jee et al., 2005).",
        "Second, because the automatically generated segments make up for the lack of explicit orthographic cues (e.g., story and paragraph breaks) in conversational speech, dialogue segmentation is useful in many spoken language understanding tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986), information retrieval (e.g., as input for the TREC Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) task), and summarization (Zechner and Waibel, 2000).",
        "This study therefore aims to explore whether a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier can integrate multiple knowledge sources for segmenting recorded speech.",
        "In this paper, we first evaluate the effectiveness of features that have been proposed in previous work, with a focus on features that can be extracted automatically.",
        "Second, we examine other knowledge sources that have not been studied systematically in previous work, but which we expect to be good predictors of dialogue segments.",
        "In addition, as our ultimate goal is to develop an information retrieval module that can be operated in a fully automatic fashion, we also investigate the impact of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors on the task of dialogue segmentation."

        "In previous work, the problem of automatic dia-",
        "One critical problem is how to divide unstructured logue segmentation is often considered as similar to conversational speech into a number of locally co-the problem of topic segmentation.",
        "Therefore, re-herent segments.",
        "The problem is important for two search has adopted techniques previously developed to segment topics in text (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1997; Reynar, 1998) and in read speech (e.g., broadcast news) (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Allan et al., 1998).",
        "For example, lexical cohesion-based algorithms, such as LCSEG (Galley et al., 2003), or its word frequency-based predecessor TextTile (Hearst, 1997) capture topic shifts by modeling the similarity of word repetition in adjacent windows.",
        "However, recent work has shown that LCSEG is less successful in identifying \"agenda-based conversation segments\" (e.g., presentation, group discussion) that are typically signalled by differences in group activity (Hsueh and Moore, 2006).",
        "This is not surprising since LCSEG considers only lexical cohesion.",
        "Previous work has shown that training a segmentation model with features that are extracted from knowledge sources other than words, such as speaker interaction (e.g., overlap rate, pause, and speaker change) (Galley et al., 2003), or participant behaviors, e.g., note taking cues (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2006), can outperform LCSEG on similar tasks.",
        "In many other fields of research, a variety of features have been identified as indicative of segment boundaries in different types of recorded speech.",
        "For example, Brown et al.",
        "(1980) have shown that a discourse segment often starts with relatively high pitched sounds and ends with sounds of pitch within a more compressed range.",
        "Passonneau and Lit-man (1993) identified that topic shifts often occur after a pause of relatively long duration.",
        "Other prosodic cues (e.g., pitch contour, energy) have been studied for their correlation with story segments in read speech (Tur et al., 2001; Levow, 2004; Christensen et al., 2005) and with theory-based discourse segments in spontaneous speech (e.g., direction-given monologue) (Hirschberg andNakatani, 1996).",
        "In addition, head and hand/forearm movements are used to detect group-action based segments (Mc-Cowan et al., 2005; Al-Hames et al., 2005).",
        "However, many other features that we expect to signal segment boundaries have not been studied systematically.",
        "For instance, speaker intention (i.e., dialogue act types) and conversational context (e.g., speaker role).",
        "In addition, although these features are expected to be complementary to one another, few of the previous studies have looked at the question how to use conditional approaches to model the correlation among features."

      "heading": "3. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "This study aims to explore approaches that can integrate multimodal information to discover implicit semantics from conversation archives.",
        "As our goal is to identify multimodal cues of segmentation in face-to-face conversation, we use the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta et al., 2006), which includes audiovideo recordings, to test our approach.",
        "In particular, we are using 50 scenario-based meetings from the AMI corpus, in which participants are assigned to different roles and given specific tasks related to designing a remote control.",
        "On average, AMI meetings last 26 minutes, with over 4,700 words transpired.",
        "This corpus includes annotation for dialogue segmentation and topic labels.",
        "In the annotation process, annotators were given the freedom to subdivide a segment into subsegments to indicate when the group was discussing a subtopic.",
        "Annotators were also given a set of segment descriptions to be used as labels.",
        "Annotators were instructed to add a new label only if they could not find a match in the standard set.",
        "The set of segment descriptions can be divided to three categories: activity-based (e.g., presentation, discussion), issue-based (e.g., budget, usability), and functional segments (e.g., chitchat, opening, closing).",
        "The first step is to break a recorded meeting into minimal units, which can vary from sentence chunks to blocks of sentences.",
        "In this study, we use spurts, that is, consecutive speech with no pause longer than 0.5 seconds, as minimal units.",
        "Then, to examine the difference between the set of features that are characteristic of segmentation at both coarse and fine levels of granularity, this study characterizes a dialogue as a sequence of segments that may be further divided into sub-segments.",
        "We take the theory-free dialogue segmentation annotations in the corpus and flatten the sub-segment structure and consider only two levels of segmentation: top-level segments and all sub-level segments.",
        "We observed that annotators tended to annotate activity-based segments only at the top level, whereas they often included subtopics when segmenting issue-based segments.",
        "For example, a top-level interface specialist presentation segment can be divided into agenda/equipment issues, user requirements, existing products, and look and usability sub-level segments.",
        "To measure intercoder agreement, we employ three different metrics: the kappa coefficient, PK, and WD.",
        "Kappa values measure how well a pair of annotators agree on where the segments break.",
        "PK is the probability that two spurts drawn randomly from a document are incorrectly identified as belonging to the same segment.",
        "WindowDiff (WD) calculates the error rate by moving a sliding window across the transcript counting the number of times the hypothesized and reference segment boundaries are different.",
        "While not uncontroversial, the use of these metrics is widespread.",
        "Table 1 shows the intercoder agreement of the top-level and sub-level segmentation respectively.",
        "It is unclear whether the kappa values shown here indicate reliable intercoder agreement.",
        "But given the low disagreement rate among codings in terms of the PK and WD scores, we will argue for the reliability of the annotation procedure used in this study.",
        "Also, to our knowledge the reported degree of agreement is the best in the field of meeting dialogue segmentation.",
        "the annotators marked 8.7 top-level segments and 14.6 sub-segments per meeting.",
        "As reported in Section 2, there is a wide range of features that are potentially characteristic ofsegment boundaries, and we expect to find some of them useful for automatic recognition of segment boundaries.",
        "The features we explore can be divided into the following five classes:",
        "Conversational Features: We follow Galley et al.",
        "(2003) and extracted a set of conversational features, including the amount of overlapping speech, the amount of silence between speaker segments, speaker activity change, the number of cue words, and the predictions of LCSEG (i.e., the lexical cohesion statistics, the estimated posterior probability, the predicted class).",
        "Lexical Features: We compile the list of words that occur more than once in the spurts that have been marked as a top-level or sub-segment boundary in the training set.",
        "Each spurt is then represented as a vector space of unigrams from this list.",
        "Prosodic Features: We use the direct modelling approach proposed in Shriberg and Stolcke (2001) and include maximum F0 and energy of the spurt, mean F0 and energy of the spurt, pitch contour (i.e., slope) and energy at multiple points (e.g., the first and last 100 and 200 ms, the first and last quarter, the first and second half) of a spurt.",
        "We also include rate of speech, in-spurt silence, preceding and subsequent pauses, and duration.",
        "The rate of speech is calculated as both the number of words and the number of syllables spoken per second.",
        "Motion Features: We measure the magnitude of relevant movements in the meeting room using methods that detect movements directly from video recordings in frames of 40 ms. Of special interest are the frontal shots as recorded by the close up cameras, the hand movements as recorded by the overview cameras, and shots of the areas of the room where presentations are made.",
        "We then average the magnitude of movements over the frames within a spurt as its feature value.",
        "Contextual Features: These include dialogue act type and speaker role (e.g., project manager, marketing expert).",
        "As each spurt may consist ofmultiple dialogue acts, we represent each spurt as a vector of dialogue act types, wherein a component is 1 or 0 depending on whether the type occurs in the spurt.",

        "We compare the performance of the reference models, which are trained on human transcripts and tested on human transcripts, with that of the ASR models, which are trained on ASR transcripts and tested on ASR transcripts.",
        "Table 6 shows that despite the word recognition errors, none of the LCSEG, the MaxEnt models trained with conversational features, and the Max-Ent models trained with all available features perform significantly worse on ASR transcripts than on reference transcripts.",
        "One possible explanation for this, which we have observed in our corpus, is that the ASR system is likely to mis-recognize different occurences of words in the same way, and thus the lexical cohesion statistic, which captures the similarity of word repetition between two adjacency windows, is also likely to remain unchanged.",
        "In addition, when the models are trained with other features that are not affected by the recognition errors, such as pause and overlap, the negative impacts of recognition errors are further reduced to an insignificant level."

        "The results in Section 4 show the benefits of including additional knowledge sources for recognizing segment boundaries.",
        "The next question to be addressed is what features in these sources are most useful for recognition.",
        "To provide a qualitative account of the segmentation cues, we performed an analysis to determine whether each proposed feature discriminates the class of segment boundaries.",
        "Previous work has identified statistical measures (e.g., Log Likelihood ratio) that are useful for determining the statistical association strength (relevance) of the occurrence of an n-gram feature to target class (Hsueh and Moore, 2006).",
        "Here we extend that study to calculate the LogLikelihood relevance ofall of the features used in the experiments, and use the statistics to rank the features.",
        "Our analysis shows that people do speak and behave differently near segment boundaries.",
        "Some of the identified segmentation cues match previous findings.",
        "For example, a segment is likely to start with higher pitched sounds (Brown et al., 1980; Ayers, 1994) and a lower rate of speech (Lehiste, 1980).",
        "Also, interlocutors pause longer than usual to make sure that everyone is ready to move on to a new discussion (Brown et al., 1980; Passonneau and Lit-man, 1993) and use some conventional expressions (e.g., now, okay, let's, um, so).",
        "Our analysis also identified segmentation cues that have not been mentioned in previous research.",
        "For example, interlocutors do not move around a lot when a new discussion is brought up; interlocutors mention agenda items (e.g., presentation, meeting) or content words more often when initiating a new discussion.",
        "Also, from the analysis of current dialogue act types and their immediate contexts, we also observe that at segment boundaries interlocutors do the following more often than usual: start speaking before they are ready (Stall), give information (Inform), elicit an assessment of what has been said so far (Elicit-assessment), or act to smooth social functioning and make the group happier (Bepositive).",
        "The third question we want to address here is whether using the output of ASR will cause significant degradation to the performance of the segmentation approaches.",
        "The ASR transcripts used in this experiment are obtained using standard technology including HMM based acoustic modeling and",
        "N-gram based language models (Hain et al., 2005).",
        "The average word error rates (WER) are 39.1%.",
        "We also applied a word alignment algorithm to ensure that the number of words in the ASR transcripts is the same as that in the human-produced transcripts.",

        "This study explores the use of features from multiple knowledge sources (i.e., words, prosody, motion, interaction cues, speaker intention and role) for developing an automatic segmentation component in spontaneous, multiparty conversational speech.",
        "In particular, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can a MaxEnt classifier integrate the potentially characteristic multimodal features for automatic dialogue segmentation?",
        "(2) What are the most discriminative knowledge sources for detecting segment boundaries?",
        "(3) Does the use of ASR transcription significantly degrade the performance of a segmentation model?",
        "First of all, our results show that a well performing MaxEnt model can be trained with available knowledge sources.",
        "Our results improve on previous work, which uses only conversational features, by 8.8% for top-level segmentation and 5.4% for sublevel segmentation.",
        "Analysis of the effectiveness of the various features shows that lexical features (i.e., cue words) are the most essential feature class to be combined into the segmentation model.",
        "However, lexical features must be combined with other features, in particular, conversational features (i.e., lexical cohesion, overlap, pause, speaker change), to train well performing models.",
        "In addition, many of the non-lexical feature classes, including those that have been identified as indicative of segment boundaries in previous work (e.g., prosody) and those that we hypothesized as good predictors of segment boundaries (e.g., motion, context), are not beneficial for recognizing boundaries when used in isolation.",
        "However, these non-lexical features are useful when combined with lexical features, as the presence of the non-lexical features can balance the tendency of models trained with lexical cues alone to overpredict.",
        "Experiments also show that it is possible to segment conversational speech directly on the ASRout-puts.",
        "These results encouragingly show that we can segment conversational speech using features extracted from different knowledge sources, and in turn, facilitate the development of a fully automatic segmentation component for multimedia archives.",
        "With the segmentation models developed and discriminative knowledge sources identified, a remaining question is whether it is possible to automatically select the discriminative features for recognition.",
        "This is particularly important for prosodic features, because the direct modelling approach we adopted resulted in a large number of features.",
        "We expect that by applying feature selection methods we can further improve the performance of automatic segmentation models.",
        "In the field of machine learning and pattern analysis, many methods and selection criteria have been proposed.",
        "Our next step will be to examine the effectiveness of these methods for the task of automatic segmentation.",
        "Also, we will further explore how to choose the best performing ensemble of knowledge sources so as to facilitate automatic selection of knowledge sources to be included.",
