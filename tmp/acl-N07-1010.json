        "Coreference resolution aims to find multiple mentions of an entity (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION) in a document.",
        "In a typical machine learning-based coref-erence resolution system (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004), a statistical model is learned from training data and is used to measure how likely an anaphor is corefer-ential to a candidate antecedent.",
        "A related, but often overlooked, problem is that the anaphor may be non-coreferential to any candidate, which arises from scenarios such as an identified anaphor is truly generic and",
        "'in this paper, \"anaphor\" includes all kinds of phrases to be resolved, which can be named, nominal or pronominal phrases.",
        "there does not exist an antecedent in the discourse context, or an anaphor is the first mention (relative to processing order) in a coreference chain.",
        "In (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b), the problem is treated by thresholding the scores returned by the coreference model.",
        "That is, if the maximum coreference score is below a threshold, then the anaphor is deemed non-referential to any candidate antecedent.",
        "The threshold approach does not model non-coreferential events directly, and is by no means the optimal approach to the problem.",
        "It also introduces a free parameter which has to be set by trial-and-error.",
        "As an improvement, Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) train a separate model to classify an anaphor as either anaphoric or non-anaphoric.",
        "The output of this classifier can be used either as a pre-filter (Ng and Cardie, 2002a) so that non-anaphoric anaphors will not be precessed in the coreference system, or as a set of features in the coreference model (Ng, 2004).",
        "By rejecting any anaphor classified as non-anaphoric in coreference resolution, the filtering approach is meant to handle non-anaphoric phrases (i.e., no antecedent exists in the discourse under consideration), not the first mention in a coreference chain.",
        "In this paper, coreference is viewed as a process of sequential operations on anaphor mentions: an anaphor can either be linked with its antecedent if the antecedent is available or present.",
        "If the anaphor, on the other hand, is discourse new (relative to the process order), then a new entity is created.",
        "Corresponding to the two types of operations, a twin-model is proposed to resolve coreferential relationships in a document.",
        "The first component is a statistical model measuring how likely an anaphor is coreferential to a candidate antecedent; The second one explicitly models the noncoreferential events.",
        "Both models are trained automatically and are used simultaneously in the coreference system.",
        "The twin-model coreference system is tested on the 2005 ACE (Automatic Content Extraction, see (NIST, 2005)) data and the best performance under both ACE-Value and entity F-measure can be obtained without tuning a free parameter.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "The twin-model is presented in Section 2.",
        "A maximum-entropy implementation and features are then presented in Section 3.",
        "The experimental results on the 2005 ACE data is presented in Section 4.",
        "The proposed twin-model is compared with related work in Section 5 before the paper is concluded."

        "A phrasal reference to an entity is called a mention.",
        "A set of mentions referring to the same physical object is said to belong to the same entity.",
        "For example, in the following sentence:",
        "(I) John said Mary was his sister.",
        "there are four mentions: John, Mary, his, and sister.",
        "John and his belong to the same entity since they refer to the same person; So do Mary and sister.",
        "Furthermore, John and Mary are named mentions, sister is a nominal mention and his is a pronominal mention.",
        "In our coreference system, mentions are processed sequentially, though not necessarily in chronological order.",
        "For a document with n mentions (m; : 1 < i < n}, at any time t(t > 1), mention mi through mt-1have been processed and each mention is placed in one of Nt(Nt < (t-1)) entities: Et = (ej : 1 < j < Nt}.",
        "Index i in m; indicates the order in which it is processed, not necessarily the order in which it appears in a document.",
        "The basic step is to extend Et to Et+1with mt.",
        "Let us use the example in Figure 1 to illustrate how this is done.",
        "Note that Figure 1 contains one possible processing order for the four mentions in Example (I): first name mentions are processed, followed by nominal mentions, followed by pronominal mentions.",
        "At time t = 1, there is no existing entity and the mention m1=John is placed in an initial entity (entity is signified by a solid rectangle).",
        "At time t = 2, m2 =Mary is processed and a new entity containing Mary is created.",
        "At time t = 3, the nominal mention m3=sister is processed.",
        "At this point, the set of existing entities",
        "E3 = {(John}, {Mary}).",
        "m3 is linked with the existing entity (Mary}.",
        "At the last step t = 4, the pronominal mention his is linked with the entity (John}.",
        "The above example illustrates how a sequence of coreference steps lead to a particular coreference result.",
        "Conversely, if the processing order is known and fixed, every possible coreference result can be decomposed and mapped to a unique sequence of such coreference steps.",
        "Therefore, if we can score the set of coreference sequences, we can score the set of coreference results as well.",
        "In general, when determining if a mention mt is coreferential with any entity in Et, there are two types of actions: one is that mt is coreferential with one of the entities; The other is that mt is not coreferential with any.",
        "It is important to distinguish the two cases for the following reason: if mt is coreferential with an entity ej, in most cases it is sufficient to determine the relationship by examining mt and ej, and their local context; But if mt is not coreferential with any existing entities, we need to consider mt with all members in Et.",
        "This observation leads us to propose the following twin-model for coreference resolution.",
        "The first model, P(L|ej, mt), is conditioned on an entity ej and the current mention mt and measure how likely they are coreferential.",
        "L is a binary variable, taking value 1 or 0, which represents positive and negative coreferential relationship, respectively.",
        "The second model, on the other hand, P (C |Et, mt), is conditioned on the past entities Et and the current mention mt.",
        "The random variable C is also binary: when C is 1, it means that a new entity (mt} will be created.",
        "In other words, the second model measures the probability that mt is not coreferential to any existing entity.",
        "To avoid confusion in the subsequent presentation, the first model will be written as P;( |ej, mt) and called link model; The second model is written as Pc ( |Et, mt) and called creation model.",
        "For the time being, let's assume that we have the link and creation model at our disposal, and we will show how they can be used to score coreference decisions.",
        "Given a set of existing entities Et = (ej }I^t, formed by mentions (mi}tZ, and the current mention mt, there are Nt + 1 possible actions: we can either link mt with an existing entity ej (j = 1, 2, • • • , Nt), or create a new entity containing mt.",
        "The link action between ej and mt can be scored by P; (11 ej, mt) while the creation action can be measured by Pc(1|Et, mt).",

        "Denote the score for action at by S(at |a1-1), where dependency of at on a1 through at-1 is emphasized.",
        "The coreference result corresponding to the action sequence is written as En((a;}\"=1).",
        "When it is clear from context, we will drop (a;}\"=1 and write En only.",
        "With this notation, the score for a coreference outcome E„((ai}\"=1) is the product of individual scores assigned to the corresponding action sequence (a; }n=1, and the best coreference result is the one with the highest score:",
        "Given n mentions, the number of all possible entity outcomes is the Bell Number (Bell, 1934): B(n) = e J2T=o \"It- Exhaustive search is out of the question.",
        "Thus, we organize hypotheses into a Bell Tree (Luo et al., 2004) and use a beam search with the following pruning strategy: first, a maximum beam size (typically 20) S is set, and we keep only the top S hypotheses; Second, a relative threshold r (we use 10-5) is set to prune any hypothesis whose score divided by the maximum score falls below the threshold.",
        "To give an concrete example, we use the example in Figure 1 again.",
        "The first step at t = 1 creates a new entity and is therefore scored by PcJohn); the second step also creates an entity and is scored by Pc(1|(John}, Mary); the step t = 3, however, links sister with (Mary} and is scored by P;(1|(Mary}, sister); Similarly, the last step is scored by P;(1|(John}, his).",
        "The score for this coreference outcome is the product of the four num-",

        "At testing time, (2) and (3), among other possible outcomes, will be searched and compared, and the one with the highest score will be output as the coreference result.",
        "Examples in (2) and (3) indicate that the link model P;(-|ej, mt) and creation model Pc(^|Et, mt) form an integrated coreference system and are applied simultaneously at testing time.",
        "As will be shown in the next section, features in the creation model Pc ( | Et, mt) can be computed from their counterpart in the link model P; ( |ej, mt) under some mild constraints.",
        "So the two models' training procedures are tightly coupled.",
        "This where their anaphoricty models are trained independently of the coreference model, and it is either used as a pre-filter, or its output is used as features in the coreference model.",
        "The creation model Pc ( |Et, mt) proposed here bears similarity to the starting model in (Luo et al., 2004).",
        "But there is a crucial difference: the starting model in (Luo et al., 2004) is an ad-hoc use of the link scores and is not learned automatically, while Pc (-|Et, mt ) is fully trained.",

        "To implement the twin model, we adopt the log linear or maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model (Berger et al., 1996) for its flexibility of combining diverse sources of information.",

        "Once the set of features functions are selected, algorithm such as improved iterative scaling (Berger et al., 1996) or sequential conditional generalized iterative scaling (Goodman, 2002) can be used to find the optimal parameter values of (Ak } and",
        "Computing features (gk(ej,mt, •)} for the link model P;(L|ej,mt) is relatively straightforward: given an entity ej and the current mention mt, we just need to characterize things such as lexical similarity, syntactic relationship, and/or semantic compatibility of the two.",
        "It is, however, very challenging to compute the features (h;(Et, mt, •)} forthe creation model Pc ( | Et, mt) since its conditioning includes a set of entities Et, whose size grows as more and more mentions are processed.",
        "The problem exists because the decision of creating a new entity with mt has to be made after examining all preceding entities.",
        "There is no reasonable modeling assumption one can make to drop some entities in the conditioning.",
        "To overcome the difficulty, we impose the following constraints on the features of the link and creation",
        "hi (Et, mt, C) =h(1) ( {gk1)(e, mt) : e G Et}) h(2)(C), for some k.",
        "(6) states that a feature in the link model is separable and can be written as a product of two functions: the first one, (•, ), is a binary function depending on the conditioning part only; the second one, gj?^), is an indicator function depending on the prediction part L only.",
        "Like gk2)(-), h(2) (•) is also a binary indicator function.",
        "(7) implies that features in the creation model are also separable; Moreover, the conditioning part (gk1)(e, mt) : e € Et}), also a binary function, only depends on the function values of the set of link features (g(,1)(e, mt) : e € Et} (for some k).",
        "In other words, once (g(,1)(e, mt) : e € Et} and C are known, we can compute h; (Et, mt, C) without actually comparing mt with any entity in Et.",
        "Using binary features is a fairly mild constraint as non-binary features can be replaced by a set of binary features through quantization.",
        "How fast (g(1)(e,mt) : e € Et}) can be computed depends on how is defined.",
        "In most cases - as will be shown in Section 3.2, it boils down testing if any member in (g(,1)(e, mt) : e € Et} is nonzero; or counting how many non-zero members there are in (g(,1)(e, mt) : e € Et}.",
        "Both are simple operations that can be carried out quickly.",
        "Thus, the assumption (7) makes it possible to compute efficiently h;(Et,mt, C).",

        "This set of features computes if two surface strings (spellings of two mentions) match each other, and are applied to name and nominal mentions only.",
        "For the link model, a lexical feature g(,1) (ej, mt) is 1 if ej contains a mention matches mt, where a match can be exact, partial, or one is an acronym of the other.",
        "Since gk (ej ,mt) is binary, one corresponding feature used in the creation model is the disjunction ofthe values in the link model, or where V is a binary \"or\" operator.",
        "The intuition is that if there is any mention in Et matching mt, then the probability to create a new entity with mt should be low; Conversely, if none of the mentions in Et matches mt, then mt is likely to be the first mention of a new entity.",
        "Take t = 2 in Figure 1 as an example.",
        "There is only one partially-established entity (John}, so E2 = (John}, and m2 = Mary.",

        "The intuition is that if there is an entity having the same property as the current mention, then the probability for the current mention to be linked with the entity should be higher than otherwise; Conversely, ifnone ofthe entities in Et shares a property with the current mention, the probability for the current mention to create a new entity ought to be higher.",

        "Therefore, the gender feature for the creation model would which means that there is at least one mention which has the same the genderofthe currentmention mt.",
        "Distance feature needs special treatment: while it makes sense to talk about the distance between a pair ofmentions, itis notimmediatelyclearhowto compute the distance between a set ofentities Et and a mention mt.",
        "To this end, we compute the minimumdistance between the entities and the current mention with respect to a \"fired\" link feature, as follows.",
        "For a particular feature gi )( , •) in the link model, define the minimum distance to be where d(m, mt) is the distance between mention mand mt.",
        "The distance itself can be the number of tokens, or the number of intervening mentions, or the number of sentences.",
        "The minimum distance e£(Et, mt; gk) is quantized and represented as binary feature in the creation model.",
        "The idea here is to encode what is the nearest place where a feature fires.",
        "Again as an example, consider the gender attribute at t = 4 in Figure 1.",
        "Assuming that d(m, mt) is the number of tokens.",
        "Since only John matches the gender of his , e£(E4, m.4; gSe„der) = 3.",
        "The number is then quantized and used as a binary feature to encode the information that \"there is a mention whose gender matches the current mention within in a token distance range including 3.\"",

        "Another interesting observation is that an optimal threshold for the entity F-measure is not necessarily optimal for ACE-Value, and vice versa: 0 = 0.3 is the best threshold for the entity F-measure, while 0 = 0.5 is optimal for ACE-Value.",
        "This is highlighted in Table 2, where row \"B-opt-F\" contains the best results op-timizingthe entity F-measure (at 0 = 0.3), row \"B-opt-AV\" contains the best results optimizing ACE-Value (at 0 = 0.5), and the last line \"Twin-model\" contains the results of the proposed twin-model.",
