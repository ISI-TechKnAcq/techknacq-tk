        "Open-domain QA (ODQA), which extracts answers from large text corpora, such as newspaper texts, has been intensively investigated in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC).",
        "ODQA systems return an actual answer in response to a question written in a natural language.",
        "However, the information in the first question input by a user is not usually sufficient to yield the desired answer.",
        "Interactions for collecting additional information to accomplish QA are needed.",
        "To construct more precise and user-friendly ODQA systems, a speech interface is used for the interaction between human beings and machines.",
        "Our goal is to construct a spoken interactive ODQA system that includes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and an ODQA system.",
        "To clarify the problems presented in building such a system, the QA systems constructed so far have been classified into a number of groups, depending on their target domains, interfaces, and interactions to draw out additional information from users to accomplish set tasks, as is shown in Table 1.",
        "In this table, text and speech denote text input and speech input, respectively.",
        "The term “addition” represents additional information queried by the QA systems.",

        "System queries for additional information to extract answers and effective interaction strategies using such queries cannot be prepared before the user inputs the question.",
        "2.",
        "Recognition errors degrade the performance of QA systems.",
        "Some information indispensable for extracting answers is deleted or substituted with other words.",
        "Our spoken interactive ODQA system, SPIQA, copes with the first problem by adopting disambiguating users’ questions using system queries.",
        "In addition, a speech summarization technique is applied to handle recognition errors.",
        "2 Spoken Interactive QA system: SPIQA Figure 1 shows the components of our system, and the data that flows through it.",
        "This system comprises an ASR system (SOLON), a screening filter that uses a summarization method, and ODQA engine (SAIQA) for a Japanese newspaper text corpus, a Deriving Disambiguating Queries (DDQ) module, and a Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) engine (Fi-nalFluet)."

        "To alleviate degradation of the QA’s performance by recognition errors, fillers, word fragments, and other distractors in the transcribed question, a screening filter that removes these redundant and irrelevant information and extracts meaningful information is required.",
        "The speech summarization approach (C. Hori et.",
        "al., 2003) is applied to the screening process, wherein a set of words maximizing a summarization score that indicates the appropriateness of summarization is extracted automatically from a transcribed question, and these words are then concatenated together.",
        "The extraction process is performed using a Dynamic Programming (DP) technique.",
        "ODQA engine The ODQA engine, SAIQA, has four components: question analysis, text retrieval, answer hypothesis extraction, and answer selection.",
        "DDQ module When the ODQA engine cannot extract an appropriate answer to a user’s question, the question is considered to be “ambiguous.” To disambiguate the initial questions, the DDQ module automatically derives disambiguating queries (DQs) that require information indispensable for answer extraction.",
        "The situations in which a question is considered ambiguous are those when users’ questions exclude indispensable information or indispensable information is lost through ASR errors.",
        "These instances of missing information should be compensated for by the users.",
        "To disambiguate a question, ambiguous phrases within it should be identified.",
        "The ambiguity of each phrase can be measured by using the structural ambiguity and generality score for the phrase.",
        "The structural ambiguity is based on the dependency structure of the sentence; phrase that is not modified by other phrases is considered to be highly ambiguous.",
        "Figure 2 has an example of a dependency structure, where the question is separated into phrases.",
        "Each arrow represents the dependency between two phrases.",
        "In this example, “the World Cup” has no modifiers and needs more information to be identified.",
        "“Southeast Asia” also has no modifiers.",
        "However, since “the World Cup”appears more frequently than “Southeast Asia” in the retrieved corpus, “the World Cup” is more difficult to identify.",
        "In other words, words that frequently occur in a corpus rarely help to extract answers in ODQA systems.",
        "Therefore, it is adequate for the DDQ module to generate questions relating to “World Cup” in this example, such as “What kind of World Cup?” , “What year was the World Cup held?”.",
        "The structural ambiguity of the nth phrase is defined as",
        "where the complete question is separated into N phrases, and D(Pi, Pn) is the probability that phrase Pn will be modified by phrase Pi, which can be calculated using Stochastic Dependency Context-Free Grammar (SDCFG) (C. Hori et.",
        "al., 2003).",
        "Using this SDCFG, only the number of non-terminal symbols is determined and all combinations of rules are applied recursively.",
        "The non-terminal symbol has no specific function, such as a noun phrase.",
        "All the probabilities of rules are stochastically estimated based on data.",
        "Probabilities for frequently used rules become greater, and those for rarely used rules become smaller.",
        "Even though transcription results given by a speech recognizer are ill-formed, the dependency structure can be robustly estimated by our SDCFG.",
        "The generality score is defined as",
        "where P(w) is the unigram probability of w based on the corpus to be retrieved.",
        "Thus, “w = cont” means that w is a content word such as a noun, verb or adjective.",
        "We generate the DQs using templates of interrogative sentences.",
        "These templates contain an interrogative and a phrase taken from the user’s question, i.e., “What kind of * ?”, “What year was * held?” and “Where is * ?”.",
        "The DDQ module selects the best DQ based on its linguistic appropriateness and the ambiguity of the phrase.",
        "The linguistic appropriateness of DQs can be measured by using a language model, N-gram.",
        "Let Smn be a DQ generated by inserting the nth phrase into the m-th template.",
        "The DDQ module selects the DQ that maximizes the DQ score:",
        "where L(•) is a linguistic score such as the logarithm for trigram probability, and λL, λD, and λG are weighting factors to balance the scores.",
        "Hence, the module can generate a sentence that is linguistically appropriate and asks the user to disambiguate the most ambiguous phrase in his or her question."
