        "Indonesia is one of the ten most populous nations in the world with the population of about 235 million people as of 2004 and is located strategically within the Asia region.",
        "The exchange of people, goods and services as well as information increases and should not be hindered by language barrier.",
        "Even though, English language may be used as the main global communication language, the more direct and more natural way of communication is preferred by local and native people to ensure the smooth exchange of information among people of different languages.",

        "It would be beneficial for Indonesia people, if there were a system that is able, to some extent in a certain domain, to capture either a speech or digital text based on Indonesian language and process it in order to output into meaningful text into other languages such as English, Japanese and other world languages.",
        "In addition to above mentioned benefit, large numbers of Indonesian people, statistically, have problem in using and comprehending any information presented in English language, The language barrier problem is compounded by the problem of the explosion of digital information whose majority uses English language via either Internet or any digital / printed form which may overwhelms potential users and pose a threat of inequality of access of information due to the language barrier (digital divide) especially for the common Indonesian people.",

        "Our approach to MT is based on the integration of stochastic and symbolic approaches to be used for analyzing Indonesian.",
        "For creating the stochastic language model, it is worthwhile to utilize annotated data when it is available and use supervised learning mechanism to estimate model's parameter.",
        "In this case, an annotated corpus is created for multiple genres of documents.",
        "Of course, the costs of annotation are prohibitively labor intensive, and the resulting corpora sometimes are susceptible to a particular genre.",
        "Due to this limitation of annotated corpora, it is necessary that we use unsupervised and weakly supervised learning techniques, which do not require large, annotated data sets.",
        "Unsupervised learning utilizes raw, un-annotated corpora to discover underlying language structure such as lexical and contextual relationships.",
        "This gives rise to emergent patterns and principles found in symbolic systems.",
        "In this system, the language model is trained using weakly supervised learning on small annotated corpus to seed unsupervised learning using much larger, un-annotated corpora.",
        "Unsupervised and weakly supervised methods have been used successfully in several areas of NLP, including acquiring verb sub-categorization frames, part-of-speech tagging, word-sense disambiguation and prepositional phrase attachment.",

        "Achievement of a high performance is often the most dominating design criterion when implementing speech recognition system.",
        "The current state of the art speech recognition technology is able to produce speaker independent recognizers which have extremely high recognition rates for small/medium vocabularies.",
        "Although the average recognition rates are high, some speakers have recognition rates considerably worse than others.",
        "It is generally agreed that speaker dependent system will give the best performance in applications involving a specific speaker.",
        "This requires, however, that enough training data is available for training the system from scratch.",
        "An often used solution is to train speaker independent system using data from many speakers.",
        "But other experiments have shown that using such systems, in general, involves obtaining a lower performance than what is achievable with a speaker dependent system.",
        "This problem can be overcome, at least partially, by using speaker adaptation techniques, the aim of which is to take an initial model system which is already trained, and use a sample of a new speaker data to attempt to improve the modeling of the speaker with the current set of the model.",
        "By collecting data from a speaker and training a model set on this speaker's data alone, the speaker's characteristics can be modeled more accurately.",
        "Such systems are commonly known as speaker dependent systems, and on a typical word recognition task, may have half the errors of a speaker independent system.",
        "The drawback of speaker dependent systems is that a large amount of data (typically hours) must be collected in order to obtain sufficient model accuracy.",
        "Rather than training speaker dependent models, adaptation techniques can be applied.",
        "In this case, by using only a small amount of data from a new speaker, a good speaker independent system model set can be adapted to better fit the characteristics of this new speaker.",
        "Speaker adaptation techniques can be used in various different modes.",
        "If the true transcription of the adaptation data is known then it is termed supervised adaptation, whereas if the adaptation data is unlabelled then it is termed unsupervised adaptation.",
        "In the case where all the adaptation data is available in one block, e.g. from a speaker enrollment session, then this termed static adaptation.",
        "Alternatively adaptation can proceed incrementally as adaptation data becomes available, and this is termed incremental adaptation.",
        "One of the researches on speaker adaptation techniques based on HMM is Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR).",
        "This method transforms the mean of continuous HMM.",
        "MLLR will generate a global adaptation transform when a small amount of data is available.",
        "While more adaptation data becomes available, improved adaptation is possible by increasing the number of transformation using the regression class.",
        "The problem then occurred when the number of regression class increased while the adaptation data is static.",
        "The transformation matrices are difficult to estimate well enough when the amount of adaptation data is reduced too much due to a fine regression class division.",
        "To overcome this problem the use of Vector Field Smoothing (VFS) incorporated with MLLR is a one technique.",
        "VFS is used to deal with the problem of retraining with insufficient training data.",
        "The transformation matrices produced by MLLR is then be used to calculate the transform vector of VFS continued by smoothing process.",
        "MLLR uses a set of regression based transform to tune the HMM mean parameter to new speaker.",
        "The aim of MLL is to estimate an appropriate transformation for the mean vectors of each mixture component so that original system is tuned to the new speaker.",
        "For mixture component s with mean /us, the adapted mean estimate hs is given by the following equation.",
        "where Ws is an n x (n +1) transformation matrix and i;s is the extended mean vector, where the value of a> indicated whether an offset term is to be included: a> = 1 for an offset, a> = 0 for no offset.",
        "The transformation matrix is determined with a re-estimation algorithm based upon the principle of maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "In this way, the re-estimated transformation matrix is the one that maximizes the probability of having generated the observed adaptation data using the model.",
        "The vector field smoothing technique assumes that the correspondence between feature vectors from different speaker is viewed as a smooth vector field.",
        "Based on this assumption, the correspondence obtained from adaptation data is considered to be an incomplete set of observation from the continuous vector filed, containing observation errors.",
        "To achieve both better correspondence and reduction errors, both interpolation and smoothing are introduce into adaptation process.",
        "VFS has three steps, as follows:",
        "• Concatenation training: In this step, the mean vector of the Gaussian distribution is trained by concatenation training.",
        "• Interpolation: In this step, the untrained mean vector is transferred to the new speaker's voice space by using an interpolated transfer vector.",
        "• Smoothing of transfer vector: In this step, each transfer vector is modified in accordance with the other transfer vector.",
        "The technique of MLLR-VFS can be separately performed in three steps.",
        "The first step is an extension of the MLLR to multiple regression matrixes.",
        "The second step is calculating the transfer vector of VFS using the regression matrix produced by MLLR.",
        "The third step is the smoothing of transfer vector as VFS usual manner.",
        "• Extension to multiple regression class",
        "If R states {s1, s2,- • •, sR }are shared in a given regression class, then the regression matrix Ws can be written:",
        "• Calculation of transfer vector",
        "The transfer vector Ah is calculated from the difference between the mean vector of the initial continuous density HMM and the initial continuous density HMM multiplied by the regression matrix.",
        "• Smoothing of transfer vector",
        "In this step, each transfer vector is modified in accordance with the other transfer vector as an usual VFS manner.",
        "We conduct these steps to develop the Indonesia speech recognition system with favorable result.",
        "Using the speech data provided by ATR-Japan, we obtain a promising result with accuracy rate around 90%.",
        "The signal processing model takes 12 kHz sampled data and transform it into 39-dimensional MFCC vectors every 10 ms (see Table 1, A: speaker independent, B: speaker dependent, Data is number of words for adaptation).",
        "This experiment also used Left-to-Right HMM model with single Gaussian Mixture.",
        "Based on this result, we are now in collaboration with Telkom RDC to develop speech data to enhance the accuracy.",
        "We will also improve the speed of the system."
