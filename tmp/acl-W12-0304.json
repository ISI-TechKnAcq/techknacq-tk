        "This paper discusses a series of early experiments on a methodology for the detection and correction of grammatical errors based on co-occurrence statistics using an extensive corpus of n-grams (Google Books, compiled by Michel et al., 2011).",
        "We start from two complementary assumptions: on the one hand, books are published accurately, that is to say, they usually go through different phases of revision and correction with high standards and thus a large proportion of these texts can be used as a reference corpus for inferring the grammar rules of a language.",
        "On the other hand, we hypothesise that with a sufficiently large corpus a high percentage of the information about these rules can be extracted with word n-grams.",
        "Thus, although there are still many grammatical errors that cannot be detected with this method, there is also another important group which can be identified and corrected successfully, as we will see in Section 4.",
        "Grammatical errors are the most difficult and complex type of language errors, because grammar is made up of a very extensive number of rules and exceptions.",
        "Furthermore, when grammar is observed in actual texts, the panorama becomes far more complicated, as the number of exceptions grows and the variety and complexity of syntactical structures increase to an extent that is not predicted by theoretical studies of grammar.",
        "Grammar errors are extremely important, and the majority of them cannot be considered to be performance-based because it is the meaning of the text and therefore, the success or failure of communication, that is compromised.",
        "To our knowledge, no grammar book or dictionary has yet provided a solution to all the problems a person may have when he or she writes and tries to follow the grammar rules of language.",
        "Doubts that arise during the writing process are not always clearly associated to a lexical unit, or the writer is not able to detect such an association, and this makes it difficult to find the solution using a reference book.",
        "In recent years, some advances have been made in the automatic detection of grammar mistakes (see Section 2).",
        "Effective rule-based methods have been reported, but at the cost of a very time-consuming task and with an inherent lack of flexibility.",
        "In contrast, statistical methods are easier and faster to implement, as well as being more flexible and adaptable.",
        "The experiment we will describe in the following sections is the first part of a more extensive study.",
        "Most probably, the logical step to follow in order to continue such a study will be a hybrid approach, based on both",
        "statistics and rules.",
        "Hence, this paper aims to contribute to the statistical approach applied to grammar checking.",
        "The Google Books N-gram Corpus is a database of n-grams of sequences of up to 5 words and records the frequency distribution of each unit in each year from 1500 onwards.",
        "The bulk of the corpus, however, starts from 1970, and that is the year we took as a starting point for the material that we used to compile our reference corpus.",
        "The idea of using this database as a grammar checker is to analyse an input text and detect any sequence of words that cannot be found in the n-gram database (which only contains n-grams with frequency equal to or greater than 40) and, eventually, to replace a unit in the text with one that makes a frequent n-gram.",
        "More specifically, we conduct four types of operations: accepting a text and spotting possible errors; inflecting a lemma into the appropriate form in a given context; filling-in the blanks in a text; and selecting, from a number of options, the most probable word form for a given context.",
        "In order to evaluate the algorithm, we applied it to solve exercises from a Spanish grammar book and also tested the detection of errors in a corpus of real errors made by second language learners.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: we first offer a brief description of related work, and then explain our methodology for each of the experiments.",
        "In the next section, we show the evaluation of the results in comparison to the Microsoft Word grammar checker and, finally, we draw some conclusions and discuss lines of future work."

        "Rule-based grammar checking started in the 1980s and crystallised in the implementation of different tools: papers by MacDonald (1983), Heidorn et al. (1982) or Richardson and Braden-Harder (1988) describe some of them (see Lea-cock et al., 2010, for a state of the art related to studies focused on language learning).",
        "This approach has continued to be used until recently (see Arppe, 2000; Johannessen et al., 2002; and many others) and is the basis of the work related with the popular grammar checker in Microsoft Word (different aspects of the tool are described in Dolan et al., 1993; Jensen et al., 1993; Gamon et al., 1997 and Heidorn, 2000: 181-207, among others).",
        "The knowledge-rich approach needs mechanisms to take into account errors within a rigid system of rules, and thus different strategies were implemented to gain flexibility (Weischedel and Black, 1980; Douglas and Dale, 1992; Schneider and McCoy, 1998 and others).",
        "Bolt (1992) and Kohut and Gorman (1995) evaluated several grammar checkers available at the time and concluded that, in general, none of the proposed strategies achieved high percentages of success.",
        "There are reasons to believe that the limitations of rule-based methods could be overcome with statistical or knowledge-poor approaches, which started to be used for natural language processing in the late 1980s and 1990s.",
        "Atwell (1987) was among the first to use a statistical and knowledge-poor approach to detect grammatical errors in POS-tagging.",
        "Other studies, such as those by Knight and Chandler (1994) or Han et al.",
        "(2006), for instance, proved more successful than rule-based systems in the task of detecting article-related errors.",
        "There are also other studies (Yarowsky, 1994; Golding, 1995 or Golding and Roth, 1996) that report the application of decision lists and Bayesian classifiers for spell checking; however, these models cannot be applied to grammar error detection.",
        "Burstein et al. (2004) present an idea similar to the present paper, since they use n-grams for grammar checking.",
        "In their case, however, the model is much more complicated since it uses a machine learning approach trained on a corpus of correct English and using POS-tags bigrams as features apart from word bigrams.",
        "In addition, they use a series of statistical association measures instead of using plain frequency.",
        "Other proposals of a similar nature are those which use the web as a corpus (More?",
        "et al, 2004; Yin et al., 2008; Whitelaw et al., 2009), although the majority of these authors also apply different degrees of processing of the input text, such as lemmatisation, POS-tagging and chunking.",
        "Whitelaw et al. (2009), working on spell checking, are among the few who disregard explicit linguistic knowledge.",
        "Sjo?bergh (2009) attempted a similar approach for grammar checking in Swedish, but with modest results.",
        "Nazar (in press) reports on an experiment where corpus statistics are used to solve a German-language multiple choice exam, the result being a score similar to that of a native speaker.",
        "The sys",
        "tem does not use any kind of explicit knowledge of German grammar or vocabulary: answers are found by simply querying a search engine and selecting the most frequent combination of words.",
        "The present paper is a continuation and extension of that idea, now with a specific application to the practical problem of checking the grammar of texts in Spanish.",
        "In spite of decades of work on the subject of grammar-checking algorithms, as summarised in the previous lines, the general experience with commercial grammar checkers is still disappointing, the most serious problem being that in the vast majority of cases errors in the analysed texts are left undetected.",
        "We believe that, in this context, a very simple grammar checker based on corpus statistics could prove to be helpful, at least as a complement to the standard procedures."

        "The following subsections offer a detailed description of the methodology of each experiment.",
        "For the evaluation, we tested whether the algorithm could solve grammar exercises from a textbook (Montol?",

        ": a wrong use of the gerund) or *ma?scaras antigases (instead of ma?scaras antiga's ?gas masks?, an irregular plural), which are errors that were not detected by MS Word.",
        "One of the difficulties we found is that, despite the fact that the corpus used is probably the most extensive corpus ever compiled, there are bigrams that are not present in it.",
        "This is not surprising, since one of the functions of linguistic competence is the capacity to represent and make comprehensible strings of words which have never been produced before.",
        "Another problem is that frequency is not always useful for detecting mistakes, because the norm can be very separated from real use.",
        "An example of this is that, in one of the error detection exercises, the system considers",
        "that the participle fre?",
        "?dos (?fried?)",
        "is incorrect because it is not in the corpus, but the participle is actually correct, even when the majority of speakers think that only the irregular form (frito) is normative.",
        "The opposite is also true: some incorrect structures are very frequently used and many speakers perceive them as correct, such as ayer noche instead of ayer por la noche (?last night?",
        "), or some very common Gallicisms such as *medi-das a tomar instead of medidas por tomar ?measures to be taken?, or *asunto a discutir (?matter to discuss?)",
        "which should be asunto para discutir.",
        "Several ideas have been put forward to address these difficulties in future improvements to this research, such as the use of trigrams and longer n-grams instead of only bigrams for error detection.",
        "POS-tagging and proper noun detection are also essential.",
        "Another possibility is to complement the corpus with different Spanish corpora, including press articles and other sources.",
        "We are also planning to repeat the experiment with a new version of the n-gram database this time not as plain word forms but as classes of objects such that the corpus will have greater power of generalisation.",
        "Following another line of research that we have already started (Nazar and Renau, in preparation), we will produce clusters of words according to their distributional similarity, which will result in a sort of Spanish taxonomy.",
        "This can be accomplished because all the words that represent, say, the category of vehicles are, in general, very similar as regards their distribution.",
        "Once we have organised the lexicon of the corpus into categories, we will replace those words by the name of the category they belong to, for instance, PERSON, NUMBER, VEHICLE, COUNTRY, ORGANISATION, BEVERAGE, ANIMAL, PLANT and so on.",
        "By doing this, the Google n-gram corpus will be useful to represent a much more diverse variety of n-grams than those it actually contains.",
