        "In his article \"Ancient symbols and computational linguistics\" (Sproat 2010), Professor Sproat raised two concerns over a method that we have proposed for analyzing small data sets of symbols using entropy (Lee, Jonathan, and Ziman 2010): first, that the method is unable to detect random but non-equiprobable systems; and second, that it misclassifies kudurru texts.We address these concerns in the following response."

        "Random systems can contain unigrams drawn from an equiprobable or from a non-equiprobable distribution.For small data sets, random but equiprobable systems are likely to have a non-equiprobable actual frequency of unigram occurrence due to the sample size.A method for determining whether a data set is unlikely to be random but equiprobable was given in Lee, Jonathan, and Ziman (2010).",

        "In written language, unigrams occur with unequal probabilities – for example, the letters e and t occur more frequently in English than the letters x and z, thereby lending some degree of predictability to the occurrence of a particular unigram, and reducing the value of E1.Random script sets drawn from a non-equiprobable distribution could have the same actual frequencies of unigram occurrence as a written language script set.However, whereas there is unigram-to-unigram dependence in a language, there is no such dependency in a random system.For example, q tends to be followed by u in English.The digram qu would therefore occur more often than other digrams starting with q.This second-order dependency is captured in the second-order entropy, E2.Thus it is one of the fundamental outcomes of Shannon's theory that the dependency in",

        "Figure 2 illustrates the effect on Ur of increasing constraint on the vocabulary and syntax in moving from prose and poetry to genealogical name lists (including king lists) to very constrained name lists utilizing only \"diminutive\" name stems (for the \"diminutive\" name stems data set, the names contained in the genealogical lists have been reduced to their \"familiar\" form, such as Al for Albert, Alan,and Alfred).This constraint further constrains the vocabulary by removing a multitude of names and replacing them with a much smaller and less diverse set.As stated in the paper (Lee, Jonathan, and Ziman 2010), one of the corpora of Pictish symbol types gives values of the structure variables (Ur and Cr) defined in the original paper that are consistent with digram communication encoding at the constrained vocabulary level such as name lists.The values that Professor Sproat calculates for the kudurrus data set places them in a similar level of communication.",
