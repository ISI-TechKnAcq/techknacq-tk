        "The correct interpretation of anaphora is vital for natural language understanding.",
        "Bridging anaphora (Clark, 1975) represents a special part of the general problem of anaphora resolution, which has been studied and discussed for various languages and domains (Hahn et al., 1996; Murata et al., 1999; Poesio et al., 2004; Gasperin and Vieira, 2004; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008).",
        "Usually bridging anaphora considers two types: associative anaphors are noun phrases (NPs) that have an antecedent that is necessary to their interpretation but the relation between the anaphor and its antecedent is different from identity; and indirect anaphors are those that have an identity relation with their antecedents but the anaphor and its antecedent have different head",
        "'The terminology that we use here is introduced by Hawkins (1978), which is also used in (Vieira et al., 2006).",
        "nouns.",
        "In this paper, we focus on associative anaphora in Japanese.",
        "Associative anaphora resolution is decomposed into two steps: acquiring lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution, and resolving associative anaphora using the acquired knowledge.",
        "Grammatical salience plays a lesser role for resolving anaphors with full lexical heads, than for pronominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn, 1999; Modjeska, 2002).",
        "Furthermore, since associative anaphors and their antecedents usually have different head nouns, string matching technique cannot be applied.",
        "Therefore, a large and diverse amount of lexical knowledge is essential to understand associative anaphora.",
        "For example, to recognize the meronymic relation between \"a house\" and \"the roof\" in (1), such knowledge as \"a roof\" is a part of a building or vehicle is required.",
        "To recognize the attributive relation between \"Prius\" and \"the price\" in (2), such knowledge as \"price\" is a price of some goods or service is required.",
        "(1) There was a house.",
        "The roof was white.",
        "(2) Toyota launched the hybrid car Prius in 1997.",
        "The price was 21.5 million yen.",
        "To acquire such lexical knowledge, various studies have been carried out.",
        "Early studies used hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as Word-Net (Strube and Hahn, 1999; Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Meyer and Dale, 2002), but obtained poor or mediocre results.",
        "Hence, Poesio et al.",
        "(2002) proposed to exploit \"N/j of NTO\" phrases in large corpora to resolve associative anaphora in English; Murata et al.",

        "much broader usage.",
        "These studies obtained reasonable results, but the coverage of the acquired knowledge was not sufficient.",
        "Recently, a number of researchers argued for using the Web as a source of lexical knowledge, and the Web has been shown to be a useful resource for anaphora resolution (Bunescu, 2003; Markert et al., 2003; Poesio et al., 2004).",
        "Hence, in this study, we acquire the lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution from \"Nm no Nh\" phrases in the Web by using the method described in (Sasano et al., 2004).",
        "We proposed a method for acquiring such lexical knowledge, called nominal case frames (NCFs), using an ordinary language dictionary and \"Nm no Nh\" phrases, and constructed NCFs from newspaper corpora.",
        "In this study, we aim to acquire a sufficient amount of lexical knowledge by constructing NCFs from the Web.",
        "As for associative anaphora resolution itself, we propose an integrated probabilistic model for zero anaphora and associative anaphora resolution, in which associative anaphora is regarded as a kind of zero anaphora and resolved by using the same model as zero anaphora.",
        "Our model assumes zero pronouns that represent indispensable entities of target noun phrases, which are called zero adnom-inal in (Yamura-Takei, 2003), and conducts zero pronoun resolution.",
        "Let us consider the associative anaphoric relation between \"Prius\" and \"kakaku\" (price).",
        "Although \"kakaku\" itself is considered as the anaphor from a conventional point of view (3a), our model assumes a zero pronoun <fi and considers it as the anaphor (3b).",
        "[antecedent: Prius, anaphor: kakaku (price)]",
        "The point of this study is three-fold: the acquisition of the lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution from the Web, the application of zero anaphora resolution model to associative anaphora resolution, and the integrated resolution of zero anaphora and associative anaphora."

        "Most nouns have their indispensable entities: \"price\" is a price of some goods or service, \"roof\" is a roof of some building, and \"coach\" is a coach of some sports.",
        "The relation between a noun and its indispensable entities is parallel to that between a verb and its arguments or obligatory cases.",

        "Whereas verbal case frame construction uses arguments of each verb (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002), nominal case frame construction basically uses adnominal constituents of each noun.",
        "However, while the meaning of a verbal argument can be distinguished by the postposition, such as \"ga\" (nominative), \"wo\" (accusative), and \"ni\" (dative), the meaning of an adnominal constituent can not be distinguished easily, because most adnominal constituents appear with the same postposition \"no\" (of).",

        "However, it is difficult to resolve associative anaphora by using a dictionary as it is, because all nouns in a definition sentence are not an obligatory case, and only the frequency information of noun phrases tells us which is the obligatory case.",
        "On the other hand, a simple method that just collects and clusters \"Nm no Nh\" phrases based on some similarity measure of nouns cannot construct comprehensive nominal case frames, because of polysemy and multiple obligatory cases.",
        "For details see (Sasano et al., 2004).",
        "It is desirable to use a probability distribution for deciding whether a case slot is obligatory or not.",
        "However, it is difficult to estimate a probability distribution, since we construct nominal case frames not by using the examples of associative anaphora itself but by using the examples of noun phrases \"Nm no Nh\" (N/j of NTO).",
        "We use such noun phrases because indispensable entities of noun \"Nh\" often appear as \"Nm.\"",

        "In this corpus, there were about 390 million noun phrases \"Nm no Nh\" about 100 million unique noun phrases, and about 17 million unique head nouns \"Nh.\"",
