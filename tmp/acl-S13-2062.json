        "The Semeval 2013 Task 2 focused on classifying Twitter messages (?tweets?)",
        "as expressing a positive opinion, a negative opinion, a neutral opinion, or no opinion (objective).",
        "In fact, the neutral and objective were joined in one class for the requirements of the shared task.",
        "Task A contained target words whose sense had to be classified in the context, while Task B was to classify each text into one of the three classes: positive, negative, and neutral/objective.",
        "The training data that was made available for each task consisted in annotated Twitter message.",
        "There were two test sets for each task, one composed of Twitter messages and one of SMS message (even if there was no specific training data for SMS messages).",

        "For the submitted systems, we also used features calculated based on SentiWordNet information (Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "SentiWordNet contains positivity, negativity, and objectivity scores for each sense of a word.",
        "We explain below how this information was used for each task.",
        "As classifiers, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM) (SMO and libSVM from Weka with default values for parameters), because SVM is known to perform well on many tasks, and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), because MNB is known to perform well on text data and it is faster than SVM."

        "Our system for Task A involved two parts: the expansion of our training data and the classification.",

        "Then the classification was completed with algorithms from Weka.",

        "This was doing using Python and the Python NLTK library, as well as SentiWordNet.",
        "SentiWordNet provides a score of the sentient state for each word (for each sense, in case the word has more than",
        "one sense).",
        "As an example, the word ?want?",
        "can mean ?a state of extreme poverty?",
        "with the SentiWordNet score of (Positive: 0 Objective: 0.75 Negative: 0.25).",
        "The same word could also mean ?a specific feeling of desire?",
        "with a score of (Positive: 0.5 Objective: 0.5 Negative: 0).",
        "We also used for expansion the definitions and synonyms of each word sense, from WordNet.",
        "The tweets in the training data are labeled with their sentiment type (Positive, Negative, Objective and Neutral).",
        "Neutral and Objective are treated the same.",
        "The provided training data has the target word marked, and also the sentiment orientation of the word in the context of the tweeter message.",
        "These target words were the ones expanded by our method.",
        "When the target was a multi-word expression, if the expression was found in WordNet, then the expansion was done directly; if not, each word was expanded in a similar fashion and concatenated to the original tweet.",
