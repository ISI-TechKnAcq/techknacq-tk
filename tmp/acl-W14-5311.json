        "The sociolinguistic situation in Arabic countries is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959) : whereas one variant Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is highly codified and mainly used for written communication, other variants coexist in regular everyday's situations (dialects).",
        "Similarly, while a number of resources and tools exist for MSA (lexica, annotated corpora, taggers, parsers .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "), very few are available for the development of dialectal Natural Language Processing tools.",
        "Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of the lack of resources for dialects consists in exploiting available MSA resources and NLP tools in order to adapt them to process dialects.",
        "This paper adopts this general framework: we propose a method to build a lexicon of deverbal nouns for Tunisian (TUN) using MSA tools and resources as starting material."

        "The Arabic language presents both a standard written form and a number of spoken variants (dialects).",
        "While dialects differ from one country to another, sometimes even within the same country, the written variety (Modern Standard Arabic, MSA), is the same for all the Arabic countries.",
        "Similarly, MSA is highly codified, and used mainly for written communication and formal spoken situations (news, political debates).",
        "Spoken varieties are used in informal daily discussions and in informal written communication on the web (social networks, blogs and forums).",
        "Such unstandardized varieties differ from MSA with respect to phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon.",
        "Linguistic resources (lexica, corpora) and natural language processing (NLP) tools for such dialects (parsers) are very rare.",
        "Different approaches are discussed in the litterature to cope with Arabic dialects processing.",
        "A general solution is to build specific resources and tools.",
        "For example, (Maamouri et al., 2004) created a Levantine annotated corpus (oral transcriptions) for speech recognition research.",
        "(Habash et al., 2005; Habash and Rambow, 2006) proposed a system including a morphological analyzer and a generator for Arabic dialects (MAGEAD) used for MSA and Levantine Arabic.",
        "(Habash et al., 2012) also built a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic that extends an existing resource, the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lexicon.",
        "Other approaches take advantage of the special relation (closeness) that exists betweeen MSA and dialects in order to adapt MSA resources and tools to dialects.",
        "To name a few, (Chiang et al., 2006) used MSA treebanks to parse Levantine Arabic.",
        "(Sawaf, 2010) presented a translation system for handling dialectal Arabic, using an algorithm to normalize spontaneous and dialectal Arabic into MSA.",
        "(Salloum and Habash, 2013) developped a translation system pivoting through MSA from some Arabic dialects (Levantine, Egyptian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic) to English.",
        "(Hamdi et al., 2013) proposed a translation system between Tunisian (TUN) and MSA verbs using an analyser and a generator for both variants.",
        "Yet if the first kind of approach is more linguistically accurate because it takes into account specificities of each dialect, building resources from scratch is costly and extremely time consuming.",
        "In this paper we will thus adopt the second approach: we will present a method to automatically build a lexicon for Tunisian deverbal nouns by exploiting available MSA resources as well as an existing MSA-TUN lexicon This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
