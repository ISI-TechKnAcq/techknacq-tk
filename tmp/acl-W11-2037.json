        "Many Natural Language Processing systems make a distinction between misunderstanding, where the system interprets an input incorrectly, and non-understanding, where the system is aware that it is not able to interpret an input (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2005).",
        "This distinction is common in dialogue systems, where it pertains to Natural Language Understanding components which pass their output to a dialogue manager: a dialogue manager will act on the contents of misunderstood input, but if it knows that the input is not understood then it can engage in a variety of recovery techniques, such as asking for clarification, moving on, or changing the topic.",
        "For this reason non-understanding is usually preferred to misunderstanding.",
        "While common to dialogue systems, the concept of non-understanding is useful for other tasks as well, whenever a system can benefit from the knowledge that its best interpretation is likely to be incorrect (see below for an example in question answering).",
        "Detecting non-understanding is a tradeoff: a system that is prone to non-understanding will inevitably miss some inputs that it would have understood correctly under a forced interpretation.",
        "This is similar but not identical to the familiar tradeoffs between recall and precision (van Rijsbergen, 1979) and between detection and error (Martin et al., 1997).",
        "Recall and precision are measures taken from information retrieval, where there are typically multiple documents relevant to a query, and ideal performance is defined as retrieving all and only the relevant documents: recall measures the \"all\" part while precision measures the \"only\" part, and tuning a system to increase one measure typically implies decreasing its counterpart.",
        "Detection and error apply to forced choice tasks: each input must be classified as either positive or negative, and decreasing false positives typically implies increasing false negatives and vice versa.",
        "The tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding is similar to recall-precision in that a response need not be given to each input, and is similar to detection-error in that when a response is given, we only care about its correctness and not about its exhaustiveness.",
        "There is presently no accepted measure for the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding.",
        "A recent example illustrating the confusion, and need for a standard measure, comes from the QALD-1 Open Challenge (Question Answering over Linked Data).",
        "The task is defined as giving a complete and correct answer to a natural language question, but systems are allowed to not return an answer.",
        "The evaluation metric uses recall and precision, but they are defined in a nonstandard way.",
        "Precision is defined as the number of correctly answered questions divided by the total number of answered questions; given that each question receives at most one answer, this is equivalent to the standard definition of correct answers divided by the total number of answers provided by the system - it penalizes misunderstanding and gives credit to non-understanding.",
        "Recall is also defined in a non-standard way.",
        "number of correctly answered questions number of questions",
        "This would normally be considered the definition of accuracy, and it penalizes misunderstanding and non-understanding equally; the standard definition of recall is the number of correct answers divided by the number of available correct answers, and it does not normally penalize incorrect answers.",
        "The reason for the confusion between recall and accuracy is that in a task where each question has a unique correct answer, failure to provide a correct answer to a question implies that an available answer has not been retrieved.",
        "What the QALD-1 evaluation does, in effect, is penalize non-understanding through accuracy, and penalize misunderstanding more, through both accuracy and precision.",
        "To properly evaluate the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding we need to look at each type of error separately.",
        "If each input receives a response, then accuracy is the complement of error; if some responses are not returned, then accuracy is the complement of the sum of errors (misunderstandings) and non-returns (non-understandings).",
        "The relative severity of misunderstanding and non-understanding will vary based on the application: a question-answering system that is required to provide accurate information might have a low tolerance for misunderstanding, while a story-driven dialogue system might have a low tolerance for asking clarification questions as a result of non-understanding.",
        "The relation between misunderstanding and non-understanding is not fixed - a system with lower error rates under a forced interpretation may turn out to have higher error rates than a competitor after allowing for non-understanding.",
        "It is therefore useful to look at the entire range of return rates when evaluating systems.",
        "The remainder of this paper introduces the error-return plot as a graphical representation for comparing error rates across different return rates, and presents examples for its use from recent experiments."

        "A Natural Language Processing component that is capable of indicating non-understanding consists of two distinct processes: figuring out the best (or most likely) response to an input, and deciding whether the best response is likely to be appropriate.",
        "These two processes may be implemented as distinct software components, as in the system used for the experiments in section 4, NPCEditor (Leuski and Traum, 2010) - a classification-based system for Natural Language Understanding that chooses the best interpretation from a fixed set.",
        "NPCEditor first calculates the appropriateness of each available interpretation, and then compares the score of the best interpretation to a predetermined threshold; if the best interpretation falls below the threshold, NPCEditor indicates non-understanding.",
        "Other implementations are, of course, possible - for example, Patel et al.",
        "(2006) describe an architecture where the system first decides if it can understand the input, and then tries to determine the interpretation only if the answer is positive.",
        "The two processes may also be linked more intimately together, but in order to determine the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding, there must be some way to isolate the decision of whether or not the input has been understood.",
        "By varying the sensitivity of this decision, we can compare the rates of misunderstanding across different rates of non-understanding.",
        "Decomposing Natural Language Understanding into two distinct processes helps illustrate the inapplicability of the popular measures of ROC curves (relative operating characteristic, Swets, 1973) and DET curves (detection error tradeoff, Martin et al., 1997).",
        "These measures only look at the decision of whether an interpretation is good enough, while abstracting away the decision about the actual interpretation.",
        "ROC and DET curves were developed for detection and verification tasks, where performance is determined by the rate of errors misses and false alarms - irrespective of the composition of the input.",
        "They plot the false alarm rate against the hit rate (ROC) or miss rate (DET) - that is, the returned errors as a proportion of all errors against the returned (ROC) or missed (DET) correct responses as a proportion of all correct responses.",
        "Consequently, ROC and DET curves say nothing about the actual error rate.",
        "A system with an error rate of 10%, where errors are uniformly spread among correct responses when ranked by the system's confidence, will have identical ROC and DET curves to a system with an error rate of 40%, 50% or 90% with the errors spread uniformly.",
        "For investigating the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding, we want to look not only at the system's decision about whether or not to return an interpretation, but also at the correctness of the chosen interpretation.",
        "We therefore need a plot that reflects the actual error rate as a function of the return rate."

        "An error-return plot is a graphical representation of the tradeoff between errors (misunderstandings) and failures to return a response (non-understandings).",
        "It applies to systems that react to each input in one of three possible ways - a correct response, an incorrect response, or a failure to respond to the input.",
        "The error rate and non-return rate are defined as follows.",
        "incorrect responses number of inputs failures to respond",
        "In order to plot the entire range of the tradeoff, the system is set to make a forced-choice response to each input.",
        "The responses are then ranked according to the system's confidence (or whatever other measure is used to decide when to issue a non-return), and at each possible cutoff, the non-return rate is plotted on the horizontal axis against the error rate on the vertical axis.",
        "As the number of non-returns grows, the number of errors can only go down, so the plot is monotonically decreasing; at the extreme right, where no responses are returned, error rates are necessarily zero, while at the extreme left, the error rate is equivalent to accuracy under a forced choice.",
        "Lower curves indicate better performance."

        "An example error-return plot is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The plot is taken from Wang et al.",
        "(2011), an experiment which tested the effect of using phonetic information in a Natural Language Understanding component in order to recover from speech recognition errors.",
        "The base system is NPCEditor (Leuski and Traum, 2010), trained for SGT Star, a virtual character who provides information about the U.S. Army to potential recruits (Artstein et al., 2009).",
        "For each input utterance, NPCEditor selects one output out of a fixed set, based on a learned mapping between input and output training examples; it also has the capability of not returning a response if the classifier's confidence in the appropriateness of the best choice falls below a certain threshold.",
        "The specific experiment in Figure 1 tested alternative methods to tokenize the input: the base tokenizer is represented by the thick black curve, and uses words as tokens; alternative tokenizers are shown in thinner lines or in shades of gray, and they use tokens with various mixtures of phonetic and word information (phone unigrams, bi-grams etc.).",
        "The test data consisted of utterances for which the correct interpretation is known, but which NPCEditor would occasionally fail to classify due to speech recognition errors.",
        "Figure 1 shows several properties at a glance.",
        "The base tokenizer has a fairly high error rate (over 30%) under forced choice, but the error rate decreases rapidly when non-understanding is allowed (on the left-hand side of the plot the slope is close to – 1, which is the steepest possible decline).",
        "When tolerance for non-understanding is low, all the alternative tokenizers produce lower error rates than the baseline; however, increasing the non-understanding does not affect all tokenizers equally, and the error rate of the baseline tokenizer improves more rapidly than others, so that at 30% non-return rate it is better than most of the alternative tokenizers.",
        "Finally, one alternative tokenizer - the thin black line shows best or almost-best performance at all return rates, supporting the hypothesis of the original experiment, that adding phonetic information to a Natural Language Understanding component can help in recovery from speech recognition errors.",
        "Figure 2 is from the same experiment but using a different data set - the one developed for the the twins Ada and Grace, two virtual guides at the Museum of Science in Boston who answer questions about their neighboring exhibits and about science in general (Swartout et al., 2010).",
        "The overall error rate is much lower than in Figure 1.",
        "Otherwise, the pattern is similar, though we see that the thin gray to-kenizer has shifted from a close second-best to being the worst performer.",
        "Once again, the thin black tok-enizer beats all the others across most return rates.",
        "Figure 3 shows a different experiment, also using NPCEditor.",
        "This experiment tested the effect of taking an existing virtual character - the twins Ada and Grace - and expanding the character's understanding by adding training input-output pairs extracted automatically from text (the method for extracting training data is described in Chen et al., 2011; the present experiment is currently under review for publication).",
        "The baseline classifier is the thick black line, trained on the Twins' original question-answer links; the alternative classifiers add automatically extracted questions-answer training links from successive orthogonal domains.",
        "All classifiers were evaluated using the same test set of questions from the original domain, in order to test how the addition of orthogonal training data affects performance on inputs from the original domain.",
        "The plot shows that the effect is quite noticeable: the original classifier has a 10% absolute error rate, which drops to virtually zero at a non-return rate of 20% and above; the augmented classifiers display a higher initial error rate, and moreover this higher error rate is not easily mitigated by accepting higher non-return rates.",
        "The augmented classifiers have the advantage of being able to understand inputs from the added domains, but the cost is some confusion on the original domain, both in terms of understanding the input, and in the ability to identify non-understanding."

        "The error-return plot is a graphical representation for looking at the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding.",
        "Evaluating systems capable of indicating non-understanding is somewhat tricky, and error-return plots can show information that is useful when comparing such systems.",
        "If the curve of one system completely dominates the other, then we can say with confidence that the first system has better performance.",
        "If the curves intersect, then we need to compare the parts of the curve where we expect actual system performance to fall, and this will vary by application.",
        "The systems described above all use the same strategy for dealing with non-understanding: they issue an \"off-topic\" response which asks for clarification, stalls, or changes the conversation topic.",
        "The systems are intended for fairly short question-answer dialogues, for which an off-topic response rate of about 1 in 5 is usually acceptable, so the critical region is around 20% non-understanding.",
        "In applications where it is possible to judge the relative severity of misunderstanding and non-understanding, a weighted average could identify the optimal setting for the non-understanding threshold.",
        "Such an average should give non-understanding a lower weight than misunderstanding, since treating them as equal would obviate the need for identifying non-understanding.",
        "A counterpart to the error rate would be the \"missed chance rate\" - the proportion of responses that would have been correct under forced choice but were not returned.",
        "Curves for missed chances start at zero (when all responses are returned) and increase with the non-return rate to a maximum of one minus the absolute error rate.",
        "The relation between the missed chance curve and the error return plot is straightforward: wherever the error return curve goes down, the missed chance curve stays level, and wherever the error return plot stays level, the missed chance curve goes up.",
        "The curves intersect at the point where the number of misunderstandings is identical to the number of non-understandings that would have been correct under forced choice; it is not clear, however, whether this point has any practical significance.",
        "Error-return plots suffer from the usual problem of evaluating single components in a dialogue system: since subsequent input is to a certain extent contingent on system actions, it is conceivable that a system prone to misunderstanding would trigger different user utterances than a system prone to non-understanding.",
        "Determining the full consequences of non-understanding would require running a full dialogue system with real users under varying settings; error-return plots show the performance of Natural Language Understanding under the assumption of fixed input.",
        "Overall, error return plots provide useful information about the tradeoff between misunderstanding and non-understanding in cases where recall/precision, ROC and DET curves are less informative.",
        "They have been used in several recent experiments, and hopefully may gain acceptance as a standard tool for system evaluation."
