        "Sociolinguistics and dialectology study how language varies across social and regional contexts.",
        "Quantitative research in these fields generally proceeds by counting the frequency of a handful of previously-identified linguistic variables: pairs of phonological, lexical, or morphosyntactic features that are semantically equivalent, but whose frequency depends on social, geographical, or other factors (Paolillo, 2002; Chambers, 2009).",
        "It is left to the experimenter to determine which variables will be considered, and there is no obvious procedure for drawing inferences from the distribution of multiple variables.",
        "In this paper, we present a method for identifying geographically-aligned lexical variation directly from raw text.",
        "Our approach takes the form of a probabilistic graphical model capable of identifying both geographically-salient terms and coherent linguistic communities.",
        "One challenge in the study of lexical variation is that term frequencies are influenced by a variety of factors, such as the topic of discourse.",
        "We address this issue by adding latent variables that allow us to model topical variation explicitly.",
        "We hypothesize that geography and topic interact, as \"pure\" topical lexical distributions are corrupted by geographical factors; for example, a sports-related topic will be rendered differently in New York and California.",
        "Each author is imbued with a latent \"region\" indicator, which both selects the regional variant of each topic, and generates the author's observed geographical location.",
        "The regional corruption of topics is modeled through a cascade of logistic normal priors â€“ a general modeling approach which we call cascading topic models.",
        "The resulting system has multiple capabilities, including: (i) analyzing lexical variation by both topic and geography; (ii) segmenting geographical space into coherent linguistic communities; (iii) predicting author location based on text alone.",
        "This research is only possible due to the rapid growth of social media.",
        "Our dataset is derived from the microblogging website Twitter, which permits users to post short messages to the public.",
        "Many users of Twitter also supply exact geographical coordinates from GPS-enabled devices (e.g., mobile phones), yielding geotagged text data.",
        "Text in computer-mediated communication is often more vernacular (Tagliamonte and Denis, 2008), and as such it is more likely to reveal the influence of geographic factors than text written in a more formal genre, such as news text (Labov, 1966).",
        "We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively.",
        "We investigate the topics and regions that the model obtains, showing both common-sense results (place names and sports teams are grouped appropriately), as well as less-obvious insights about slang.",
        "Quantitatively, we apply our model to predict the location of unlabeled authors, using text alone.",

        "A large number of slang terms are found to have strong regional biases, suggesting that slang may depend on geography more than standard English does.",

        "This paper presents a model that jointly identifies words with high regional affinity, geographically-coherent linguistic regions, and the relationship between regional and topic variation.",
