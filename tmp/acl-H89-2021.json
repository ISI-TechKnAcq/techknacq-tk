        "To study the spoken language interface in the context of a complex problem-solving task, a group of users were asked to perform a spreadsheet task, alternating voice and keyboard input.",
        "A total of 40 tasks were performed by each participant, the first thirty in a group (over several days), the remaining ones a month later.",
        "The voice spreadsheet program used in this study was extensively instrumented to provide detailed information about the components of the interaction.",
        "These data, as well as analysis of the participants's utterances and recognizer output, provide a fairly detailed picture of spoken language interaction.",
        "Although task completion by voice took longer than by keyboard, analysis shows that users would be able to perform the spreadsheet task faster by voice, if two key criteria could be met: recognition occurs in real-time, and the error rate is sufficiently low.",
        "This initial experience with a spoken language system also allows us to identify several metrics, beyond those traditionally associated with speech recognition, that can be used to characterize system performance."

        "Large vocabularies make it possible to create habitable languages for complex applications.",
        "Finally, a natural language processing capability allows the user to express him or herself using familiar locutions.",
        "While the recognition technology base that makes spoken language systems possible is rapidly maturing, there is no corresponding understanding of how such systems should be designed or what capabilities users will expect to have available.",
        "It is intuitively apparent that speech will be suited for some functions (e.g., data entry) but unsuited for others (e.g., drawing).",
        "We would also expect that users will be willing to tolerate some level of recognition error, but do not know what this is or how it would be affected by the nature of the task being performed or by the error recovery facilities provided by the system.",
        "Meaningful exploration of such issues is difficult without some baseline understanding of how humans interact with a spoken language system.",
        "To provide such a baseline, we implemented a spoken language system using currently available technology and used it to study humans performing a series of simple tasks.",
        "We chose to work with a spreadsheet program since the spreadsheet supports a wide range of activities, from simple data entry to complex problem solving.",
        "It is also a widely used program, with a large experienced user population to draw on.",
        "We chose to examine performance over an extended series of tasks because we believe that regular use will be characteristic of spoken language applications."

        "The recognition code is embedded in the spreadsheet program, so that the complete system runs as a single process.",
        "To train the phonetic models used in the recognizer, we combined several different databases, all recorded at Carnegie Mellon using the same microphone as used for the spreadsheet study (a close-talking Sen-nheiser HMD-414).",
        "The training speech consisted of: calculator sentences (1997 utterances), a (general) spreadsheet database (1819 utterances), and a task-specific database for financial data (196 utterances).",
        "A total of 4012 utterances was thus included in the training set.",
        "Table 1 provides some performance data that characterize system performance.",
        "The basic recognition performance (\"Reference\"), as tested on speech collected at the same time as the training data, is about what might be expected given the known performance characteristics of the SPHINX system (specifically, 94% word accuracy for the perplexity 60 version of the Resource Management task).",
        "The Table also presents recognition performance for speech collected in the user study described below (\"Live Session\").",
        "The \"complete\" version shows system performance over 4 sessions representing 4 different talkers and chosen from about the midpoint of the initial 30 task series (details below).",
        "Note that this set includes utterances that contain various spontaneous speech phenomena that cannot be handled correctly by the current system.",
        "The \"clean speech\" set includes only those utterances that both contain no interjected material (e.g., audible non-speech) and that are grammatical.",
        "Performance on this set is quite good, and there is no evidence that mere \"spontaneity\" leads to poorer recognition performance.",
        "We can verify this equivalence more concretely by comparing read and spontaneous speech produced by the same talkers.",
        "To do this, we asked the four participants whose speech comprised the spontaneous test sets to return and record read versions of their spontaneous utterances, using scripts taken from our transcriptions.",
        "As can be seen in the Table, performance is comparable for read and live speechl.",
        "Given that this pattern of results can be shown to generalize to other tasks (and there is no reason to believe that they would not), the implications of this experiment are highly significant: A system trained on read speech will not substantially degrade in accuracy when presented with spontaneous speech provided that certain other characteristics, such as speech rate, will be comparable.",
        "Note that this only applies to those utterances that are comparable to read speech insofar as they are grammatical and contain no extraneous acoustic events.",
        "The system will still need to deal with these phenomena.",
        "This result is encouraging for those approaches to spontaneous speech [10] that deal with such speech in terms of accounting for extraneous events and interpreting agrammatical utterances.",
        "If these problems can be solved in a satisfactory manner, then we can comfortably expect spontaneous spoken language system performance to be comparable to system performance evaluated on read speech."

        "What would happen if we eliminate this overhead?",
        "If we replot the data by subtracting these times, but retaining the time taken to speak an utterance, we find that the difference between speech and keyboard is reduced, though not eliminated (see Figure 4).",

        "The present study also provides a strong basis for the development of exact evaluation techniques for spoken language systems.",
        "The results of this study make it apparent that utterances are the key unit of analysis for SLS performance evaluation.",
        "The success or failure of a particular transaction depends on whether the system correctly interprets the user's intention, as expressed by that utterance.",
        "Utterance misinterpretation impacts one of the critical measures of task efficiency, the time it takes to complete a task.",
        "Word accuracy, while a useful metric, cannot be used to accurately characterize system performance.",
        "We have described three utterance-level metrics that we believe are necessary for a full characterization of SLS performance.",
        "Exact accuracy tracks the performance of the speech recognition component and reflects both the ability to identify words and the ability to deal with certain classes of extraneous non-lexical events.",
        "Exact accuracy is therefore a measure of \"raw\" recognition power.",
        "Semantic accuracy tracks the performance of the system as a whole and is the actual determiner of transaction success.",
        "The contribution of higher-level processing is defined by the spread between the exact and semantic accuracy curves.",
        "But note that the marginal contribution of such processing is also a function of exact accuracy.",
        "As the latter improves, the former will improve only insofar as it provides an improvement over the existing recognition performance.",
        "Grammatical accuracy specifies the utterance rejection rate for the parsing component of the system.",
        "In the case of the present system, a rejection is simply any transcription that cannot be parsed.",
        "In the case of a more sophisticated system (for example, one that is capable of engaging the user in a clarification dialogue or interpreting agrammatical utterances), defining grammaticality may be more difficult but should not on principle be impossible.",
        "Grammatical accuracy also reflects the habitability of a system, inasfar as it allows the user to express his or her task-relevant intentions in a natural manner.",
        "In any case, tracking grammatical accuracy allows the evaluation of how well the system embodies the language necessary for task performance by a given user population.",
        "Grammatical accuracy, measured over time as in the present study can also provide insight into how easy a system language is to learn and how adequate it is for a given range of activities.",
        "Measurements taken after an",
        "elapsed interval, as in the current paradigm, can provide an indication of how well a user remembers the language constraints imposed by a SLS and can thus reflect the quality of its design.",
        "The metrics presented above can be used to describe system performance in ways that are useful for understanding the characteristics of a particular spoken language system.",
        "As such, they would be of limited interest to those not directly involved in spoken language research.",
        "In a larger arena, SLSs will be competing with other interface technologies and the bases for comparison will be universally applicable metrics, such as task completion time and ease of use.",
        "The challenge is to build systems that can compete successfully on those terms."
