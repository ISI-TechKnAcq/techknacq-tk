        "MSA is the only form of written communication in the whole of the Arab world.",
        "Thus, there exists a living writing and reading community of MSA.",
        "However, the level of MSA acquisition by its members is far from being homogeneous, and their linguistic knowledge, even at the highest levels of education, very unequal.",
        "This problem is going to have its impact on our corpus annotation training, routine, and results.",
        "As in other Semitic languages, inflection in MSA is mostly carried by case endings, which are represented by vocalic diacritics appended in word-final position.",
        "One must specify here that the MSA material form used in the corpus data we use consists of a graphic representation in which short vowel markers and other pertinent signs like the ‘shaddah’ (consonantal germination) are left out, as is typical in most written Arabic, especially news writing.",
        "However, this deficient graphic representation does not indicate a deficient language system.",
        "The reader reads the text and interprets its meaning by ‘virtually providing’ the missing grammatical information that leads to its acceptable interpretation.",
        "Our description and analysis of MSA linguistic structures is first done in terms of individual words and then expanded to syntactic functions.",
        "Each corpus token is labeled in terms of its category and also in terms of its functions.",
        "It is marked morphologically and syntactically, and other relevant relationship features also intervene such as concord, agreement and adjacency.",

      "heading": "2.3 The issue of vocalization",
      "text": [
        "The corpus for our annotation in the ATB requires that annotators complement the data by mentally supplying morphological information before choosing the automatic analysis, which amounts to a prerequisite ‘manual/human’ intervention and which takes effect even before the annotation process begins.",
        "Since no automatic vocalization of unvocalized MSA newswire data is provided prior to annotation, vocalization becomes the responsibility of annotators at both layers of annotation.",
        "The part-of-speech (POS) annotators provide a first interpretation of the text/data and a vocalized output is created for the syntactic treebank (TB) annotators, who then engage in the responsibility of either validating the interpretation under their scrutiny or challenging it and providing another interpretation.",
        "This can have drastic consequences as in the case of the so-called ‘Arabic deverbals’ where the same bare graphemic structure can be two nouns in an ‘idhafa (annexation or construct state) situation’ with a genitive case ending on the second noun or a ‘virtual’ verb or verbal function with a noun complement in the accusative to indicate a direct object.",
        "In Example 1, genitive case is assigned under the noun interpretation, while accusative case is assigned by the same graphemic form of the word in its more verbal function (Badawi, et al., 2004, cf.",
        "Section 2.10, pp.",
        "237-246).",

        "Vocalization decisions have a nontrivial impact on the overall annotation routine in terms of both accuracy and speed.",
        "Vocalization is a difficult problem, and we did not have the tools to address it when the project began.",
        "We originally decided to treat our first corpus, AFP, by having annotators supply word-internal lexical identity vocalization only, because that is how people normally read Arabic – taking the normal risks taken by all readers, with the assumption that any interpretation of the case or mood chosen would be acceptable as the interpretation of an educated native speaker annotator.",
        "In our second corpus, UMAAH, we decided that it would improve annotation and the overall usefulness of the corpus to vocalize the texts, by putting the necessary rules of syntax and vocalization at the POS level of annotation – our annotators added case endings to nouns and voice to verbs, in addition to the word-internal lexical identity vocalization.",
        "For our third corpus, ANNAHAR (currently in production), we have decided to fully vocalize the text, adding the final missing piece, mood endings for verbs.",
        "In conclusion, vocalization is a nagging but necessary “nuisance” because while its presence just enhances the linguistic analysis of the targeted corpus, its absence could be turned into an issue of quality of annotation and of grammatical credibility among Arab and non-Arab users."

        "The question we had to face in the early stages of ATB was how to develop a Treebank methodology – an analysis of all the targeted syntactic structures – for MSA represented by unvocalized written text data.",
        "Since all Arabic readers – Arabs and foreigners – go through the process of virtually providing/inserting the required grammatical rules which allow them to reach an interpretation of the text and consequent understanding, and since all our recruited annotators are highly educated native Arabic speakers, we accepted going through our first corpus annotation with that premise.",
        "Our conclusion was that the two-level annotation was possible, but we noticed that because of the extra time taken hesitating about case markings at the TB level, TB annotation was more difficult and more time-consuming.",
        "This led to including all possible/potential case endings in the POS alternatives provided by the morphological analyzer.",
        "Our choice was to make the two annotation passes equal in difficulty by transferring the vocalization difficulty to the POS level.",
        "We also thought that it is better to localize that difficulty at the initial level of annotation and to try to find the best solution to it.",

        "The challenge was and still is to find annotators with a very high level of grammatical knowledge in MSA, and that is a tall order here and even in the Arab region.",
        "So, having made the change from unvocalized text in the ‘AFP Corpus’ to fully vocalized text now for the ‘ANNAHAR Corpus,’ we still need to ask ourselves the question of what is better: (a) an annotated corpus in which the ATB end users are left with the task of providing case endings to read/understand or (b) an annotated ATB corpus displaying case endings with a higher percentage of errors due to a significantly more complex annotation task?"

        "1.",
        "The first factor which affects annotation accuracy and consistency pertains to the annotators’ educational background (their linguistic ‘mindset’) and more specifically to their knowledge – often confused and not clear – of traditional MSA grammar.",
        "Some of the important obstacles to POS training come from the confusing overlap, which exists between the morphological categories as defined for Western language description and the MSA traditional grammatical framework.",
        "The traditional Arabic framework recognizes three major morphological categories only, namely NOUN, VERB, and PARTICLE.",
        "This creates an important overlap which leads to mistakes/errors and consequent mismatches between the POS and syntactic categories.",
        "We have noticed the following problems in our POS training: (a) the difficulty that annotators have in identifying ADJECTIVES as against NOUNS in a consistent way; (b) problems with defining the boundaries of the NOUN category presenting additional difficulties coming from the fact that the NOUN includes adjectives, adverbials, and prepositions, which could be formally nouns in particular functions (e.g., from fawq Js0 NOUN to fawqa 'Js'0 PREP “above” and fawqu �Js'0 ADV etc.).",
        "In this case, the NOUN category then overlaps with the adverbs and prepositions of Western languages, and this is a problem for our annotators who are linguistically savvy and have an advanced knowledge of English and, most times, a third Western language.",
        "(c) Particles are very often indeterminate, and their category also overlaps with prepositions, conjunctions, negatives, etc.",
        "2.",
        "The second factor which affects annotation accuracy and speed is the behemoth of grammatical tests.",
        "Because of the frequency of obvious weaknesses among very literate and educated native speakers in their knowledge of the rules of ‘<iErAb’ (i.e., case ending marking), it became necessary to test the grammatical knowledge of each new potential annotator, and to continue occasional annotation testing at intervals in order to maintain consistency.",
        "While we have been able to take care of the first factor so far, the second one seems to be a very persistent problem because of the difficulty level encountered by Arab and foreign annotators alike in reaching a consistent and agreed upon use of case-ending annotation."

        "We also benefited from the existence at LDC of a rich experience in linguistic annotation.",
        "We were innovative with respect to traditional grammar when necessary and when we were sure that other syntactic approaches accounted for the data.",
        "Our goal is for the Arabic Treebank to be of high quality and to have credibility with regards to the attitudes and respect for correctness known to be present in the Arabic world as well as with respect to the NLP and wider linguistic communities.",
        "The creation and use of efficient tools such as an automated morphological analyzer and an automated parsing engine ease and speed the annotation process.",
        "These tools helped significantly in the successful creation of a process to analyze Arabic text grammatically and allowed the ATB team to publish the first significant database of morphologically and syntactically annotated Arabic news text in the world within one year.",
        "Not only is this an important achievement for Arabic for which we are proud, but it also represents significant methodological progress in treebank annotation as our first data release was realized in significantly less time.",
        "Half a million MSA words will be treebanked by end of 2004, and our choice of MSA corpora will be diversified to be representative of the current MSA writing practices in the Arab region and the world.",
        "In spite of the above, we are fully aware of the humbling nature of the task and we fully understand and recognize that failures and errors may certainly be found in our work.",
        "The devil is in the details, and we remain committed to ironing out all mistakes.",
        "We count on the feedback of our users and readers to complete our work."
