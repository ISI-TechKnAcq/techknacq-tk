        "This paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems.",
        "We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use, e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval.",
        "This raises questions about the validity of such approaches.",
        "In the second half of the paper, we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task.",
        "We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique, place upon a prototype Natural Language system.",
        "We identify three important requirements which arose from the task that we gave our subjects: operators specific to the task of database access, complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source.",
        "We discuss how these might be satisfied by future Natural Language systems."

        "It is clear that a number of different criteria might be employed in the evaluation of Natural Language (NL) systems.",
        "It is also clear that there is no consensus on how evaluation should be carried out [RQR*88, GM84].",
        "Among the different criteria that have been suggested are (a) Coverage; (b) Learnabil-ity; (c) General software requirements; (d) Comparison with other interface media.",
        "Coverage is concerned with the set of inputs which the system should be capable of handling and one issue we will discuss is how this set should be identified.",
        "Learnability is premised on the fact that complete coverage is not forseeable in the near future.",
        "As a consequence, any NL system will have limitations and one problem for users will be to learn to communicate within such limitations.",
        "Learnability is measured by the ease with which new users are able to identify these coverage limitations, and exploit what coverage is available to carry out their task.",
        "The general software criteria of importance are speed, size, modifiability and installation and maintenance costs.",
        "Comparison studies have mainly required users to perform the same task using either a formal query language such as SQL or a restricted natural language and evaluated one against the other on such parameters as time to solution or number of queries per task[SW83, JTS*85].",
        "Our discussion will mainly address the problem of coverage: we shall not discuss these other issues further.",
        "Our concern here will be with interactive NL interfaces and not other applications of NL technology such as MT or messaging systems.",
        "Interactive interfaces are not designed to be used in isolation, rather, they are intended to be connected to some sort of backend system, to improve access to that system.",
        "Our view is that NL systems should be evaluated with this in mind: the aim will be to identify the NL inputs which a typical user would want to enter in order to utilise that backend system to carry out a representative task.",
        "By representative task we mean the class of task that the back-end system was designed to carry out.",
        "In the case of databases, this would be accessing or updating information.",
        "For expert systems it might involve identifying or diagnosing faults."

        "One method that is often used in computer science for the evaluation of systems is the use of test suites.",
        "For NL systems the idea is to generate a corpus of sentences which contains the major set of syntactic, se- 116 - mantic and pragmatic phenomena the system should cover [BB84, FNSW87].",
        "One problem with this approach is how we determine whether the test set is complete.",
        "Do we have a clear notion of what constitute the major phenomena of language so that we can generate test sentences which identify whether these have been analysed correctly?",
        "Theories of syntax are well developed and may provide us with a good taxonomy of syntactic phenomena, but we do not have similar classifications of key pragmatic requirements.",
        "There are two reasons why current approaches may fail to identify the key phenomena.",
        "Current test sets are organised on a single-utterance basis, with certain exceptions such as intersentential anaphora and ellipsis.",
        "Now it may be that more complex discourse phenomena such as reference to dialogue structure arise when systems are being used to carry out tasks, because of the need to construct and manipulate sets of information [McK84].",
        "In addition, context may contribute to inputs being fragmentary or telegraphic in style.",
        "Unless we investigate systems being used to carry out tasks, such phenomena will continue to be omitted from our test suites and NL systems will have to be substantially modified when they are connected to their backend systems.",
        "Thus we are not arguing against the use of test suites in principle but rather are attempting to determine what methodology should be used to design such test suites."

        "Despite arguments that such studies are highly necessary [Ten79], few systematic studies have been conducted [Dam81, JTS*85, Kra80].",
        "The problem here may be with finding committed users who are prepared to make serious use of a fragile system.",
        "A major problem with such studies concerns the robustness of the systems which were tested and this leads to difficulties in the interpretation of the results.",
        "This is because a fragile system necessarily imposes limitations on the ways that a user can interact with it.",
        "We cannot therefore infer that the set of sentences that users input when they have adjusted to a fragile system, reflects the set of inputs that they would wish to enter given a system with fewer limitations.",
        "In other words we cannot infer that such inputs represent the way that users would ideally wish to interact using NL.",
        "The users may well have been employing strategies to communicate within the limitations of the system and they may therefore have been using a highly restricted form of English.",
        "Indeed the existence of strategies such as paraphrasing and syntax simplification when a query failed, and repetition of input syntax when a query succeeded has been documented [Tho80, WW89].",
        "Since we cannot currently envisage a system without limitations, we may want to exploit this ability to learn system limitations, nevertheless the existence of such user strategies does not give us a clear view of what language might have been used in the absence of these limitations."

        "One technique which overcomes some of the problems of robustness has been to use pen and paper tasks.",

        "This technique has also been employed to evaluate formal query languages such as SQL.",

        "When the subjects have generated their natural language query, it is evaluated by judges to determine whether it would have successfully elicited the information from the system.",
        "This approach avoids the problem of using fragile systems, but it is susceptible to the same objections as were levelled at test suites: a potential drawback with the approach concerns the representativeness of the set of tasks the users are required to do when they carry out the translation tasks.",
        "For the tasks described by Reisner, for example, the queries are all one shot, i.e. they are attempts to complete a task in a single query [Rei77].",

        "A similar technique to pen and paper tasks has been the use of a method called the \"Wizard of Oz\" (henceforth WOZ) which also avoids the problem of the fragility of current systems by simulating the operation of the system rather than using the system itself.",
        "- 117 - In these studies, subjects are told that they are interacting with the computer when in reality they are linked to the Wizard, a person simulating the operation of the system, over a computer network.",
        "In Guindon's study using the WOZ technique, subjects were told they were using an NL front-end to a knowledge-based statistics advisory package [GSBC86].",
        "The main result is a counterintuitive one.",
        "These studies suggest that people produce \"simple language\" when they believe that they are using an NL interface.",
        "Guindon has compared the WOZ dialogues of users interacting with the statistics package, to informal speech, and likened them to the simplified register of \"baby talk\" [SF77].",
        "In comparison with informal speech, the dialogues have few passives, few pronouns and few examples of fragmentary speech.",
        "One problem with the research is that it has been descriptive: It has chiefly been concerned with demonstrating the fact that the language observed is \"simple\" relative to norms gathered for informal and written speech and the results are expressed at too general a level to be useful for system design.",
        "It is not enough to know, for example, that there are fewer fragments observed in WOZ type dialogues than in informal speech: it is necessary to know the precise characteristics of such fragments if we are to design a system to analyse these when they occur.",
        "Despite this, our view is that WOZ represents the most promising technique for identifying the target requirements of an NL interface.",
        "However, to avoid the problem of precision described above, we modified the technique in one significant respect.",
        "Having used the WOZ technique to generate a set of sentences that users ideally require to carry out a database retrieval task, we then input these sentences into a NL system linked to the database.",

      "heading": "4 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "This paper had two objectives: the first was to evaluate the use of the WOZ technique for assessing NL systems and the second was to investigate the effect of task on language use.",
        "One criticism we made of both test suites and tasks using pen and paper, was that they may attempt to evaluate systems against inadequate criteria.",
        "Specifically they may not evaluate the adequacy of NL systems when users are carrying out tasks with specific software systems.",
        "The unknown words analysis seems to bear this out: we found 3 classes of unknown words which occurred only because our users were doing a task.",
        "Firstly our users wanted to carry out operations - 120 - involving the selection and permutation of answer sets and make explicit reference to their properties.",
        "Secondly, we found that our subjects wanted to use complex reference to refer back to previous queries in order to refine those queries, or to exclude answers to previous queries from their current query.",
        "Finally, we found that users attempted to use the structure of the information source, in this case the database, in order to access information.",
        "Together these 3 classes accounted for 45% of all unknown words.",
        "We believe that whatever the task and software, there will always be instances of operators, context use and reference to the information source.",
        "It would therefore seem that coverage of these 3 sets of phenomena is an important requirement for any NL interface to an application.",
        "The fact that other evaluation techniques may not have detected this requirement is, we believe, a vindication of our approach.",
        "An exception to this is the work of Cohen et al.",
        "[CPA82] who point to the need for retaining and tracking context in this type of application.",
        "Of course there are still problems with the WOZ technique.",
        "One such problem concerns the task representativeness and a difficulty in designing this study lay in the selection of a task which we felt to be typical of database access.",
        "Clearly more information from field studies would be useful in helping to identify prototypical database access tasks.",
        "A second problem lies in the interpretation of the results with respect to the classification and frequency of the unknown word errors: how frequently must an error occur if it is to warrant system modification?",
        "For example, references to the information source accounted for only 5% of the errors and yet we believe this is an interesting class of error because exploiting the structure of the database was a useful retrieval tactic for some users.",
        "The frequency problem is not specific to this study, but is an instance of a general problem in computational linguistics concerning the coverage and the range of phenomena to which we address our research.",
        "In the past, the field has focussed on the explanation of theoretically interesting phenomena without much attention to their frequency in naturally occurring speech or text.",
        "It is clear, however, that if we are to be successful in designing working systems, then we cannot afford to ignore frequently occurring but theoretically uninteresting phenomena such as punctuation or dates.",
        "This is because such phenomena will probably have to be treated in whatever application we design.",
        "Frequency data may also be of real use in determining priorities for system improvement.",
        "As a result of using our technique, we have identified a number of unknown words.",
        "How should these words be treated?",
        "Some of the unknown words are synonyms of words already in the system.",
        "Here the obvious strategy is to modify the NL system by adding these.",
        "In other cases, system modification may not be possible because linguistic theory does not have a treatment of these words.h In these circumstances, there are three possible strategies for finessing the problem.",
        "The first two involve encouraging users to avoid these words, either by generating cooperative error messages to enable the user to rephrase the query and so avoid the use of the problematic word [Adg88, Ste88] or by user training.",
        "The third strategy for finessing the analysis of such words is to supplement the NL interface with another medium such as graphics, and we will describe an example of this below.",
        "We believe that the use of such finessing strategies will be important if NL systems are to be usable in the short term.",
        "Our data suggests that certain words are used frequently by subjects in doing this task.",
        "It is also clear that computational linguistics has no treatment of these words.",
        "If we wish to build a system which will enable our users to carry out the task, we must be able to respond in some way to such inputs.",
        "The above techniques may provide the means to do this, although the use of such strategies is still an under-researched area.",
        "For the unknown words encountered in this study, of the operators, many can be dealt with by simple system modification because they are synonyms of list or show.",
        "Within the class of operators, however, it would seem that new semantic interpretation procedures would have to be defined for verbs like arrange or order.",
        "These would involve two operations, the first would be the generation of a set, and the second the sorting of that set in terms of some attribute such as age or date.",
        "The unknown words relating to explicit reference to set properties would not be difficult to add to the system, given that they can be paraphrased as relative clauses.",
        "For example, the sentence Find Van Gogh paintings to include four different themes can be paraphrased as Find Van Gogh paintings that have different themes.",
        "The context words present a much more serious problem.",
        "Current linguistic theory does not have treatments of words like previously or already, in terms of how these scope in dialogues.",
        "On some occasions, these are used to refer to the immediately prior query only, whereas on other occasions they - 121 - might scope back to the beginning of the dialogue.",
        "In addition, words like more or another present new problems for discourse theory in that they require extensional representations of answers: Given the query Give me 10 paintings followed by Now give me 5 more paintings, the system has to retain an extensional representation of the answer set generated to the first query, if it is to respond appropriately to the second one.",
        "Otherwise it will not have a record of precisely which 10 paintings were originally selected, so that these can be excluded from the second set.",
        "This extensional record would have to be incorporated into the discourse model.",
        "One solution to the dual problems presented by context words is again to either finesse the use of such words or to use a mixed media interface of NL and graphics.",
        "If users had the answers to previous queries presented on screen, then the problems of determining the reference set for phrases like the paintings already mentioned could be solved by allowing the users to click on previous answer sets using a mouse, thus avoiding the need for reference resolution.",
        "For the references to the information source, it would not be difficult to modify the system so it could analyse the majority of the the specific instances recorded here, but it is not clear that all of them could have been solved in this way, especially those that require some form of inferencing based on the database structure.",
        "There are also a number of unknown words in the data that have not been discussed here, because these did not directly arise from the fact that our users were carrying out a task.",
        "Nevertheless, the set of strategies given above is also relevant to these.",
        "Just as with the task specific words, there are a number of words which can be added to the system with relatively little effort.",
        "The system can be modified to cope with the majority of the open class unknown words, e.g. common nouns, adjectives, and verbs, many of which are simple omissions from the domain-specific lexicon.",
        "Some of the closed class words such as prepositions and personal pronouns may also prove straightforward to add.",
        "There are also a number of these words which did not arise from the task, which are more 'difficult to add to the system.",
        "This is true for a few the open class words domain-independent words, including adjectives like same and different.",
        "The majority of the closed class words, may also be difficult to add to the system, including superlatives and various logical connectives, then, neither, some quantifiers, e.g. only, as well as words which relate to the control of dialogue such as right and o.k..",
        "These words indicate genuine gaps in the coverage of the system.",
        "Fox these difficult words, it might necessary to finesse the problem of direct analysis.",
        "In conclusion, the WOZ technique proved successful for NL evaluation.",
        "We identified 3 classes of task based language use which have been neglectec by other evaluation methodologies.",
        "We believe that these classes exist across applications and tasks: Fox any combination of application and task, specific operators will emerge, and support will have to be provided to enable reference to context and information.",
        "structure.",
        "In addition, we were able to suggest a number of strategies for dealing with unknown words.",
        "Fox certain words, NL system modification can be easily achieved.",
        "For others, different strategies have to be employed which avoid direct analysis of these words These finessing strategies are important if NL systems are to usable in the short term.",
