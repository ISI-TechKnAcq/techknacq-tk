        "Signalling turn-taking intentions is essential for successful speech communication.",
        "Accordingly, it was shown for all well-described languages that turn holding and yielding cues are robustly encoded in complex redundant bundles of mor-phosyntactic and/or phonetic patterns.",
        "The phonetic patterns primarily rely on prosody, taking a considerable part of its functional load.",
        "Compared with turn holding, turn yielding is typically signalled phrase-finally by extensive terminal falling or high rising F0 movements, deviation from modal phonation ?",
        "mostly in the direction of creak phonation ?",
        "and increasing final lengthening from penultimate to ultimate syllables.",
        "These differences seem to be used in the same way across many languages, and not least for this reason their validity is beyond doubt (e.g., Duncan, 1972; Beattie, 1981; Lehiste, 1982; Kohler, 1983; Nakatani et al., 1995; Ogden, 2001; Fon, 2002; Kohler, 2004; Peters, 2006; Vaissi?re & Michaud 2006; Gravano, 2009; Fon et al., 2011).",
        "However, leaving aside gaze and gesture patterns (cf. Kendon, 1995; Taboada, 2006), a growing body of evidence from production studies suggests that the phonetics of turn-taking is still richer and goes beyond the traditional triad of voice quality, duration, and the level or direction of F0 patterns.",
        "Turn holding or yielding also seems to include the fourth prosodic dimension, i.e. intensity, as well as details in the shape of phrase-final rises and the degree of phrase-final segmental reduction.",
        "For example, phrase-final voiceless plosives in English are realized either fully pronounced and with strong post-aspiration, or in reduced forms that lack post-aspiration and are (partly) replaced by glottalization, cf. ?got?",
        "[gW?tH] vs. [gW?0/t4], and ?cap?",
        "[kH+QpH] vs. [kH+Q/p|].",
        "The difference between the unreduced and reduced forms was for a long time claimed to be a matter of free variation, until it was revealed in corpus analyses of different varieties of English that reduced forms were produced turn-medially whereas unreduced forms occurred almost exceptionally at the end of a speaker's turn (Local et al., 1986; Docherty et al., 1997; Local & Walker, 2012).",
        "More recently, it was additionally found for English and French in independent analyses of spontaneous speech corpora that the intensity levels of phrase-final syllables differ depending",
        "on whether the syllables occur turn-medially or turn-finally (Gravano & Hirschberg, 2009; Clemens & Dieckhaus, 2009; Raux, 2008; Fried-berg, 2011).",
        "The difference was the same in both languages: ?speakers tend to lower their voices when approaching turn boundaries, whereas they reach turn-internal pauses with a higher intensity?",
        "(Gravano & Hirschberg, 2009:256).",
        "Furthermore, Dombrowski & Niebuhr (2005) showed on the basis of one of the largest corpora of Standard Northern German ?",
        "the Kiel Corpus of Spontaneous Speech ?",
        "that it is not only the range of phrase-final intonation movements that",
        "distinguishes turn-internal from turn-final boundaries.",
        "At least in the case of rises, it also matters whether the shape of the rise is concave (slow rise followed by fast rise) or convex (fast rise followed by slow rise).",
        "Convex rises occurred predominantly turn-medially, whereas concave rises were used by speakers almost invariably at the end of a turn.",

        "Providing a first answer to this question is the main aim of the present paper.",

        "In order to test the effects of intensity differences and particularly of reduction differences on the perception of turn-internal and turn-final boundaries, we used the most frequent sonorous word-final syllable in German: <-en#>.",
        "It always occurs unstressed and is phonologically represented as a sequence of schwa and alveolar nasal /?n/.",
        "However, next to its corresponding canonical pronunciation as [?n] (or rather [I4n]), the word-final <-en#> syllable is known to undergo different reduction processes.",
        "The two most important processes are /?/ elision, which leaves a syllabic nasal, and assimilation of the syllabic nasal to the place of articulation of the preceding consonant.",

        "ence between non-assimilated and assimilated question-final /n/, and their reaction to this subtle difference was consistent with that of Experiment 1: Participants respond readily when the target question ended less reduced, and/or they hesitated to respond after those target questions whose final <-en#> syllables were more strongly reduced.",
        "So, Experiment 2 provided additional evidence for our conclusion that stronger segmental reduction functions as a cue to turn-holding and/or that weaker segmental reduction functions as a cue to turn-yielding.",
        "The intensity level of the final <-en#> syllables had a separate effect.",
        "That louder ending questions delayed the participants?",
        "response times suggests that a high utterance-final intensity level has a turn-holding function.",
        "Additionally (or alternatively), the immediate responses after soft ending questions indicate that the lower utterance-final intensity level is a cue to turn-yielding.",
        "Like for the segmental effects above, the intensity effects fit in well with the real use and distribution of intensity differences in spontaneous dialogues, cf. 1.1.",
        "If we view the loud vs. soft contrast in terms of a low vs. high degree of reduction, then we can see that intensity reduction and segmental reduction played opposite roles in turn-taking.",
        "Stronger reduction at the segmental level pointed in the direction of turn-holding, whereas stronger intensity reduction pointed in the direction of turn-yielding.",
        "This fact leads to the conclusion that turn-taking cues are no indexical cues insofar as they cannot be uniformly projected onto changes in the speaker's effort.",
        "Furthermore, Experiment 2 also replicated the Segmental-Context effect of Experiment 1.",
        "Assuming ?",
        "in accord with previous studies and informal measurements in our stimuli ?",
        "that the labial condition was associated with an overall lower intensity level in the target words than the velar condition (e.g., due to longer closure durations, less intense releases, and closed lips during nasal production), then the unexpected Segmental-Context effect becomes understandable as an additional reflection of the role of intensity in turn-taking.",
        "That is, as has been anticipated in 3.5, the intrinsically higher intensity in our velar target words created a bias towards turn-holding, and/or the intrinsically less intense labial target words created a bias towards turn-yielding.",
        "Finally, a comparison of Figures 4 and 6 shows that the response times yielded by Experiment 2 were overall longer than those of Experiment 1.",
        "This general bias should not be over interpreted as it is probably just due to the fact that Experiment 2 was performed in the evening, whereas Experiment 1 took place in the morning."
