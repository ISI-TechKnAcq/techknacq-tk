        "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is emerging as a commercially attractive application of natural language processing (NLP) for the booming market of English as foreign or second language (EFL/ESL).",
        "The de facto standard approach to GEC is to build a statistical model that can choose the most likely correction from a confusion set of possible correction choices.",
        "The way the confusion set is defined depends on the type of error.",
        "Work in context-sensitive spelling error correction (Golding and Roth, 1999) has traditionally focused on confusion sets with similar spelling (e.g., {dessert, desert}) or similar pronunciation (e.g., {there, their}).",
        "In other words, the words in a confusion set are deemed confusable because of orthographic or phonetic similarity.",
        "Other work in GEC has defined the confusion sets based on syntactic similarity, for example all English articles or the most frequent English prepositions form a confusion set (see for example (Tetreault et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010; Gamon, 2010; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011) among others).",
        "In contrast, we investigate in this paper a class of grammatical errors where the source of confusion is the similar semantics of the words, rather than orthography, phonetics, or syntax.",
        "In particular, we focus on collocation errors in EFL writing.",
        "The term collocation (Firth, 1957) describes a sequence of words that is conventionally used together in a particular way by native speakers and appears more often together than one would expect by chance.",
        "The correct use of collocations is a major difficulty for EFL students (Farghal and Obiedat, 1995).",
        "In this work, we present a novel approach for automatic correction of collocation errors in EFL writing.",
        "Our key observation is that words are potentially confusable for an EFL student if they have similar translations in the writer's first language (L1-language), or in other words if they have the same semantics in the L1-language of the writer.",
        "The Chinese word (kàn), for example, has over a dozen translations in English, including the words see, look, read, and watch.",
        "A Chinese speaker who still \"thinks\" in Chinese has to choose from all these possible translations when he wants to express a sentence like I like to watch movies and might instead produce a sentence like *I like to look movies.",
        "Although the meanings of watch and look are similar, the former is clearly the more fluent choice in this context.",
        "While these types of L1-transfer er rors have been known in the EFL teaching literature (Swan and Smith, 2001; Meng, 2008), research in GEC has mostly ignored this fact.",
        "We first analyze collocation errors in the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a fully annotated one-million-word corpus of learner English which we will make available to the community for research purposes (see Section 3 for details about the corpus).",
        "Our analysis confirms that many collocation errors can be traced to similar translations in the writer's L1-language.",
        "Based on this result, we propose a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction.",
        "The key component in our approach generates L1-induced paraphrases which we automatically extract from an L1-English parallel corpus.",
        "Our proposed approach outperforms traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms on a test set of real-world learner data in an automatic and a human evaluation.",
        "Finally, we present a detailed analysis of unsolved instances in our data set to highlight directions for future work.",
        "Our work adds to a growing body of research that leverages parallel corpora for semantic NLP tasks, for example in word sense disambiguation (Ng et et al., 2010b).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section reviews related work.",
        "Section 3 presents our analysis of collocation errors.",
        "Section 4 describes our approach for automatic collocation error correction.",
        "The experimental setup and the results are described in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.",

        "In this section, we give an overview of related work on collocation error correction.",
        "We also highlight differences between collocation error correction and related NLP tasks like context-sensitive spelling error correction, synonym extraction, lexical substitution, and paraphrasing.",
        "Most work in collocation error correction has relied on dictionaries or manually created databases to generate collocation candidates (Shei and Pain, 2000; Wible et al., 2003; Futagi et al., 2008).",
        "Other work has focused on finding candidates that collocate with similar words, e.g., verbs that appear with the same noun objects form a confusion set (Liu et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010).",
        "The work most similar to ours is probably the one presented by Chang et al.",
        "(2008), as they also use translation information to generate collocation candidates.",
        "However, they do not use automatically derived paraphrases from parallel corpora but bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Dictionaries usually have lower coverage, do not contain longer phrases or inflected forms, and do not provide any translation probability estimates.",
        "Also, their work focuses solely on verb-noun collocations, while we target collocations of arbitrary syntactic type.",
        "Context-sensitive spelling error correction is the task of correcting spelling mistakes that result in another valid word, see for example (Golding and Roth, 1999).",
        "It has traditionally focused on a small number of predefined confusion sets, like homophones or frequent spelling errors.",
        "Even when the confusion sets are formed automatically, the similarity of words in a confusion set has been based on edit distance or phonetic similarity (Carlson et al., 2001).",
        "In contrast, we focus on words that are confusable due to their similar semantics instead of similar spelling or pronunciation.",
        "Also, we do not assume that the set of confusion sets is already given to us.",
        "Instead, we automatically extract confusable candidates from a parallel corpus.",
        "Synonym extraction (Wu and Zhou, 2003), lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) and paraphrasing (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) are related to collocation correction in the sense that they try to find semantically equivalent words or phrases.",
        "However, there is a subtle but important difference between these tasks and collocation correction.",
        "In the former, the main criterion is whether the original phrase and the synonym/paraphrase candidate are substitutable, i.e., both form a grammatical sentence when substituted for each other in a particular context.",
        "In contrast, in collocation correction, we are primarily interested in finding candidates which are not substitutable in their English context but appear to be substitutable in the L1-language of the writer, i.e., one forms a grammatical English sentence but the other does not.",
        "Collocation errors 2,747",
        "Avg.",
        "collocation error length (words) 1.17",
        "Avg.",
        "correction length (words) 1.13 the annotated phrase or the suggested correction is longer than 3 words, as we observe that they contain highly context-specific corrections and are unlikely to generalize well (e.g., \"for the simple reasons that these can help them\" – \"simply to\").",
        "After filtering, we end up with 2,747 collocation errors and their respective corrections, which account for about 6% of all errors in NUCLE.",
        "This makes collocation errors the 7th largest class of errors in the corpus after article errors, redundancies, prepositions, noun number, verb tense, and mechanics.",
        "Not counting duplicates, there are 2,412 distinct collocation errors and corrections.",
        "Although there are other error types which are more frequent, collocation errors represent a particular challenge as the possible corrections are not restricted to a closed set of choices and they are directly related to semantics rather than syntax.",
        "We analyzed the collocation errors and found that they can be attributed to the following sources of confusion: Spelling: We suspect that an error is caused by similar orthography if the edit distance between the erroneous phrase and its correction is less than a certain threshold.",
        "Homophones: We suspect that an error is caused by similar pronunciation if the erroneous word and its correction have the same pronunciation.",
        "We use the CuVPlus English dictionary (Mitton, 1992) to map words to their phonetic representations.",
        "Synonyms: We suspect that an error is caused by synonymy if the erroneous word and its correction are synonyms in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We use",
        "WordNet 3.0.",
        "Ll-transfer: We suspect that an error is caused by L1-transfer if the erroneous phrase and its correction share a common translation in a Chinese-English phrase table.",
        "The details of the phrase table construction are described in Section 4.",
        "We note that although we focus on Chinese-English translation, our method is applicable to any language pair where parallel corpora are available.",
        "As CuVPlus and WordNet are defined for individual words, we extend the matching process to phrases in the following way: two phrases A and B are deemed homophones/synonyms if they have the same length and the i-th word in phrase A is a homophone/synonym of the corresponding i-th word in phrase B."
