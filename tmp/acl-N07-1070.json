        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the process of producing such a markup.",

        "On the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) data, using correct syntactic parses, it is possible to achieve accuracies rivaling human inter-annotator agreement.",

        "Both the Treebank on which the syntactic parser is trained and the PropBank on which the SRL systems are trained represent articles from the year 1989 of the WSJ.",
        "While all these systems perform quite well on the WSJ test data, they show significant performance degradation (approximately 10 point drop in F-score) when applied to label test data that is different than the genre that WSJ represents (Pradhan et al., 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "Surprisingly, it does not matter much whether the data is from another newswire, or a completely different type of text - as in the Brown corpus.",
