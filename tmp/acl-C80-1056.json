        "What is ambiguity?",
        "The term 'ambiguity' usually refers to the property that certain sentences may be interpreted in more than one way and that insufficient clues are available for the intended or optimal interpretation.",
        "The decision as to whether or not there are ambiguities in a given sentence is difficult; some systems with little knowledge may overlook the possibility of alternative interpretations in some sentences, and other systems may be puzzled as to which interpretation to choose even when there is only one plausible interpretation for human beings.",
        "In general, the more knowledge a system has, the greater are its possibilities of interpretation.",
        "One solution is to generate all possible interpretations and ask the user to choose one of them.",
        "But this is obviously absurd.",
        "Another solution is as follows: in the parsing process, the system chooses one interpretation and if that one fails, looks for another, and in the semantic process it produces all plausible interpretations on the basis of certain criteria10.",
        "A different approach is adopted in EXAM.",
        "The reasons for this are as follows:",
        "1) In the processing of the Japanese language, it is undesirable to separate the parsing and the semantic process, since noun phrases, especially the subject are often omitted.",
        "Thus, we cannot parse Japanese sentences efficiently without using semantic information.",
        "2) It is undesirable to ask the user to choose from among several interpretations whenever ambiguities occur in text understanding systems.",
        "3) We may overlook the possibility of other interpretations if we adopt the strategy of making semantic interpretations after parsing, since such a strategy might exclude what turns out to be the proper interpretation when making a choice among several grammatically ambiguous alternatives.",
        "It would be awkward if there is another interpretation and we realize that it is the appropriate one only after having processed several sentences.",
        "EXAM is an experimental text understanding system designed to deal with ambiguities effectively and efficiently.",
        "EXAM consists of three components: hierarchical knowledge sources, a semantic interpreter and a fundamentally breadth first augmented context-free parser.",
        "The second version of EXAM is under development on the HLISP system using the HITAC 8700/8800 at the University of Tokyo."

        "We group such homonyms into several special frames whose category is \"GROUP\" in accordance with their semantic category.",
        "If there is sufficient information to determine the sense of the semantic interpretation, the \"GROUP\" frames are re placed by the frames corresponding to the appropriate sense.",
        "The \"case ordering\" is also an indicator of \"likelihood\".",
        "Inoue4 points out that in Japanese, there is a certain ordering of cases in thematization and relativization, such as: subject>object>dative>locativegoal>source... We have adopted this notion and have applied it to the disambiguation of certain grammatical ambiguities.",
        "For example, consider the following phrase: Taroo no kenkyuu In the absence of any particular context, the system is more likely to interpret this phrase as Taroo ga suru/sita kenkyuu 'the research carried out by Taroo' than Taroo ni tuite no kenkyuu 'research concerning Taroo'.",
        "These devices are very effective in dealing with homonymy, polysemy and grammatical ambiguity.",

        "In the semantic interpretation, if the \"PROTO\" frames are instantiated with some slot filler, then the category \"PROTO\" is replaced by the category \"INSTANT\".",
        "The distinction between these categories, that is, \"PROTO\" and \"INSTANT\", is important.",
        "For example, akai iro no kuruma 'a red car' and sonna iro no kuruma 'a car with such a color' are well-formed expressions, but iro no kuruma 'a car with color' is rather ill-formed.",
        "We explain this phenomenon as follows: the frame with the \"INSTANT\" category is, as it were, a specified frame, and is therefore preferred to \"PROTO\" frames in the modification of other frames.",
        "This distinction is also used as an indicator of \"likelihood\".",
        "[We must note that the frames with categories such as \"PROTO\", \"INSTANT\" and \"GROUP\" are merely temporary in the working memory, and these categories are replaced by appropriate ones such as \"CLASS\" (which means generic), \"INDIVIDUAL\" (which means specific object) or \"SOME\" (which means indefinite object) in the meaning interpretation process.]",
        "In the second semantic interpretation, dealing with referential ambiguity constitutes the most important phase of the process.",
        "Usually, candidates for the referent are not uniquely determined in the local context where the ambiguity occurs.",
        "Therefore, EXAM delays the disambiguation until after the entire sentence has been processed.",
        "EXAM collects the requirements of the referent from the interpretation of the comlete sentence.",
        "In particular, some Predicates such as hosii 'want' produce opaque contexts.?",
        "and in such cases the category determinationll should be carried out after processing the entire sentence.",
        "Taroo no inn waTaroo no mu wet In this case, only the first is plausible, and the second is unnecessary.",
        "(In fact, the second partial parsed tree is plausible only when the sentence is of a form such as: Taroo no, inn Ha ...) Therefore, EXAM eliminates unnecessary parsing trees in accordance with the result of the semantic interpretation, that is, \"likelihood\".",
        "This method makes the parsing process more efficient, but involves some risk of misinterpretation.",
        "Hence, the elimination of parsing trees is carried out on the basis of certain linguistic evidence7, and the number of the parsed trees which are retained may sometimes be greater than one.",
        "The other task is to produce \"anticipations\" in the second semantic interpretation.",

        "In this manner, \"anticipations\" also serve to produce plausible interpretations and eliminate some ambiguities.",
        "As for ambiguities in meaning, EXAM does not deal with these in an entirely conclusive manner.",

        "If some information contradicting (8-b) exists, the Truth Maintenance System will delete (8-b) from the text memory.",
        "Here, we adopt the following standpoint: if the disambiguation is essential for the understanding of the text, the text (or the writer) will certainly provide clues adequate to disambiguate the sentence, and if this is not the case, the system may adopt any interpretation consistent with the context.",
        "In fact, sentences which follow ambiguous ones are often paraphrases of or explanations for them.",
