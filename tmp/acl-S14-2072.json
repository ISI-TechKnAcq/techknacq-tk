        "We describe the semantic text similarity systems we developed for two of the SemEval tasks for the 2014 International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.",
        "We developed systems for task 3, Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (Jurgens et al., 2014), and task 10, Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity (Agirre et al., 2014).",
        "A key component in all the systems was an enhanced version of the word similarity system used in our entry (Han et al., 2013b) in the 2013 SemEval Semantic Textual Similarity task.",
        "Our best system in the Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity task used an unsupervised approach and ranked second in both the English and Spanish subtasks.",
        "In the Cross-Level Semantic Similarity task we developed a number of new algorithms and used new linguistic data resources.",

        "Section 2 describes our word similarity model and it's wrapper to deal with named entities and out of vocabulary words.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 describe how we extended the word similarity model for the specific tasks.",
        "Section 5 presents the results we achieved on these tasks along with instances where the system failed.",
        "Section 6 highlights our future plans for improving the system.",
        "2 Semantic Word Similarity Model 2.1 LSA Word Similarity Model Our word similarity model is a revised version of the one we used in the 2013 *SEM semantic text similarity task.",
        "This was in turn derived from a system developed for the Graph of Relations project (UMBC, 2013b).",
        "For SemEval, we wanted a measure that considered a word's semantics but not its lexical category, e.g., the verb ?marry?",
        "should be semantically similar to the noun ?wife?.",
        "An online demonstration of a similar model developed for the GOR project is available (UMBC, 2013a), but it lacks some of this version's features.",
        "LSA-based word similarity.",
        "LSA Word Similarity relies on the distributional hypothesis that words occurring in the same context tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1968).",
        "LSA relies on the fact that words that are semantically similar (e.g., cat and feline or nurse and doctor) are more likely to occur near one another in text.",
        "Thus evidence for word similarity can be computed from a statistical analysis of a large text corpus.",
        "We extracted raw word co-occurrence statistics from a portion of the 2007 crawl of the Web corpus from the Stanford WebBase project (Stan- ford, 2001).",
        "We processed the collection to remove some undesirable elements (text duplica-416 Word pair ?4 model ?1 model 1 doctor NN, physician NN 0.775 0.726 2 car NN, vehicle NN 0.748 0.802 3 person NN, car NN 0.038 0.024 4 car NN, country NN 0.000 0.016 5 person NN, country NN 0.031 0.069 6 child NN, marry VB 0.098 0.000 7 wife NN, marry VB 0.548 0.274 8 author NN, write VB 0.364 0.128 9 doctor NN, hospital NN 0.473 0.347 10 car NN, driver NN 0.497 0.281 Table 1: Examples from the LSA similarity model.",
        "tions, truncated text, non-English text and strange characters) and produced a three billion word corpus of high quality English, which is available online (Han and Finin, 2013).",
        "We performed POS tagging and lemmatization on the corpus using the Stanford POS tag-ger (Toutanova et al., 2000).",
        "Word/term co-occurrences were counted in a moving window of a fixed size that scans the entire corpus.",
        "We generated two co-occurrence models using window sizes ?1 and ?4 because we observed different natures of the models.",
        "?1 window produces a context similar to the dependency context used in (Lin, 1998).",
        "It provides a more precise context but is only good for comparing words within the same POS.",
        "This is because words of different POS are typically surrounded by words in different syntactic forms.",
        "In contrast, a context window of ?4 words allows us to compute semantic similarity between words with different POS.",
        "Examples from our LSA similarity model are given in Table 1.",
        "Pairs 1 to 6 illustrate that the measure has a good property of differentiating similar words from non-similar words.",
        "Examples 7 and 8 show that the ?4 model can detect semantically similar words even with different POS while the ?1 model yields poor results.",
        "The pairs in 9 and 10 show that highly related, but not sub-stitutable, words may have a strong similarity and that the ?1 model is better at detecting them.",
        "Our word co-occurrence models were based on a predefined vocabulary of more than 22,000 common English words and noun phrases.",
        "We also added to it more than 2,000 verb phrases extracted from WordNet.",
        "The final dimensions of our word co-occurrence matrices are 29,000?",
        "29,000 when words are POS tagged.",
        "Our vocabulary includes only open-class words, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "There are no proper nouns in the vocabulary with the only exception of country names.",
        "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been found to be effective in improving word similarity measures (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "SVD is typically applied to a word by document matrix, yielding the familiar LSA technique.",
        "In our case, we apply it to our word by word matrix (Burgess et al., 1998).",
        "Before performing SVD, we transform the raw word co-occurrence count f ij to its log frequency log(f ij +1).",
        "We select the 300 largest singular values and reduce the 29K word vectors to 300 dimensions.",
        "The LSA similarity between two words is defined as the cosine similarity of their corresponding word vectors after the SVD transformation.",
        "See (Han et al., 2013b; Lushan Han, 2014) for examples and more information on the LSA model.",
        "Statistical word similarity measures have limitations.",
        "Related words can have similarity scores as high as what similar words get, e.g., ?doctor?",
        "and ?hospital?.",
        "Word similarity is typically low for synonyms that have many word senses since information about different senses are mashed together (Han et al., 2013a).",
        "To address these issues, we augment the similarity between two words using knowledge from WordNet, for example, increasing the score if they are in the same WordNet synset or if one is a direct or two link hypernym of the other.",
        "See (Han et al., 2013b) for further details.",
        "2.2 Word Similarity Wrapper Our word similarity model is restricted to the vocabulary size which only comprises open class words.",
        "For words outside of the vocabulary, we can only rely on their lexical features and determine equivalence (which we score as 0 or 1, since a continuous scale makes little sense in this sce-nario).",
        "An analysis of the previous STS datasets show that out-of-vocabulary words account for about 25 ?",
        "45% of the total words.",
        "Datasets like MSRpar and headlines lie on the higher end of this spectrum due to the high volume of proper nouns.",
        "In the previous version, we computed a character bigram overlap score given by characterBigramScore = |A ?B| |A ?B| where A and B are the set of bigrams from the first and second word respectively.",
        "We compare this 417 against a preset threshold (0.8) to determine equivalence.",
        "While this is reasonable for named enti-ties, it is not the best approach for other classes.",
        "Named Entities.",
        "The wrapper is extended to handle all classes of named entities that are included in Stanford CoreNLP (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "We use heuristic rules to compute the similarity between two numbers or two dates.",
        "To handle named entity mentions of people, locations and or-ganizations, we supplement our character bigram overlap method with the DBpedia Lookup service (Mendes et al., 2011).",
        "For each entity mention, we select the DBpedia entity with the most inlinks, which serves as a good estimate of popularity or significance (Syed et al., 2010).",
        "If the two named entity mentions map to identical DBpedia entities, we lower our character bigram overlap threshold to 0.6.",
        "OOV words.",
        "As mentioned earlier, when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, we only have its lexical features.",
        "A straightforward approach is to simply get more context for the word.",
        "Since our vocabulary is limited, we need to use external dictionaries to find the word.",
        "For our system, we use Wordnik (Davidson, 2013), which is a compilation of several dictionaries including The American Heritage Dictionary, Wikitionary and Word-Net.",
        "Wordnik provides a REST API to access several attributes for a given word such as it's defini-tions, examples, related words etc.",
        "For out of vocabulary words, we simply retrieve the word pair's top definitions and supply it to our existing STS system (UMBC, 2013a) to compute its similarity.",
        "As a fallback, in case the word is absent even in Wordnik, we resort to our character bigram overlap measure.",
        "3 Multilingual Semantic Text Similarity 3.1 English STS For the 2014 STS-English subtask we submitted three runs.",
        "They all used a simple term alignment strategy to compute sentence similarities.",
        "The first run was an unsupervised approach that used the basic word-similarity model for term alignment.",
        "The next two used a supervised approach to combine the scores from the first run with alignment scores using the enhanced word-similarity wrapper.",
        "The two runs differed in their training.",
        "Align and Penalize Approach.",
        "The pairingWord run was produced by the same Align-and-Penalize system (Han et al., 2013b) that we used in the 2013 STS task with only minor changes.",
        "The biggest change is that we included a small list of disjoint concepts (Han et al., 2013b) that are used in the penalization phase, such as {piano, vi-olin} and {dog, cat}.",
        "The disjoint concepts were manually collected from the MSRvid dataset provided by the 2012 STS task because we still lack a reliable general method to automatically produce them.",
        "The list only contains 23 pairs, which can be downloaded at (dis, 2014).",
        "We also slightly adjusted our stopword list.",
        "We removed a few words that appear in the trial datasets of 2013 STS task (e.g., frame) but we did not add any new stopwords for this year's task.",
        "All the changes are small and we made them only in the hope that they can slightly improve our system.",
        "Unlike machine learning methods that require manually selecting an appropriate trained model for a particular test dataset, our unsupervised Align-and-Penalize system is applied uniformly to all six test datasets in 2014 STS task, namely, deft-forum, deft-news, headlines, images, OnWN and tweet-news.",
        "It achieves the second best rank among all submitted runs.",
        "Supervised Machine Learning.",
        "Our second and third runs used machine learning approaches similar to those we developed for the 2013 STS task but with significant changes in both pre-processing and the features extracted.",
        "The most significant pre-processing change was the use of Stanford coreNLP (Finkel et al., 2005) tool for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and identifying named entity mentions.",
        "For the tweet-news dataset we also removed the hashtag symbol (?#?)",
        "prior to applying the Stanford tools.",
        "We use only open class words and named entity mentions and remove all other tokens.",
        "We align tokens between two sentences based on the updated word similarity wrapper that was described in Section 2.2.",
        "We use information content from Google word frequencies for word weights similar to our approach last year.",
        "The alignment process is a many-to-one mapping similar to the Align and Penalize approach and two tokens are only aligned if their similarity is greater than 0.1.",
        "The sentence similarity score is then computed as the average of the scores of their aligned tokens.",
        "This score, along with the Align and Penalize approach score, are used as features to train support vector regression (SVR) models.",
        "418 We use an epsilon SVR with a radial basis kernel function and use a grid search to get the optimal parameter values for cost, gamma and epsilon.",
        "We use datasets from the previous STS tasks as training data and the two submitted runs differ in the choice of their training data.",
        "The first approach, named Hulk, is an attempt to use a generic model trained on a large data set.",
        "The SVR model uses a total of 3750 sentence pairs (1500 from MSRvid, 1500 from MSRpar and 750 from headlines) for training.",
        "Datasets like SMT were excluded due to poor quality.",
        "The second approach, named Super Saiyan, is an attempt at domain specific training.",
        "For OnWN, we used 1361 sentence pairs from previous OnWN dataset.",
        "For Images, we used 1500 sentence pairs from MSRvid dataset.",
        "The others lacked any domain specific training data so we used a generic training dataset comprising 5111 sentence pairs from MSRvid, MSRpar, headlines and OnWN datasets.",
        "3.2 Spanish STS As a base-line for this task we first considered translating the Spanish sentences to English and running the same systems explained for the English Subtask (i.e., pairingWord and Hulk).",
        "The results obtained applying this approach to the provided training data gave a correlation of 0.777 so, we selected this approach (with some improve-ments) for the competition.",
        "Translating the sentences.",
        "For the automatic translation of the sentences from Spanish to English we used the Google Translate API 1 , a free, multilingual machine-translation product by Google.",
        "Google Translate presents very accurate translations for European languages by using statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990) where the translations are generated on the basis of statistical models derived from bilingual text corpora.",
        "In fact, Google used as part of this corpora 200 billion words from United Nations documents that are typically published in all six official UN languages, including English and Spanish.",
        "In the experiments performed with the trial data we manually evaluated the quality of the translations (one of the authors is a native Spanish speaker).",
        "The overall translation was very accurate but some statistical anomalies, incorrect translations due to the abundance of a specific sense of 1 http://translate.google.com I1: Las costas o costa de un mar, lago o extenso r?",
        "?o es la tierra a lo largo del borde de estos.",

        "On one hand, some homonym words are wrongly translated.",
        "For example, the Spanish sentence ?Las costas o costa de un mar [...]?",
        "was translated to ?Costs or the cost of a sea [...]?.",
        "The Spanish word costa has two different senses: ?coast?",
        "(the shore of a sea or ocean) and ??cost?",
        "(the property of having material worth).",
        "On the other hand, some words are translated preserving their semantics but with a slightly different meaning.",
        "For example, the Spanish sentence ?Un coj?",
        "?n es una funda de tela [...]?",
        "was correctly translated to ?A cushion is a fabric cover [...]?.",
        "However, the Spanish sentence ?Una almohada es un coj?",
        "?n en forma rectangular [...]?",
        "was translated to ?A pillow is a rectangular pad [...]?",
        "2 .",
        "Dealing with statistical anomalies.",
        "The aforementioned problem of statistical machine translation caused a slightly adverse effect when computing the similarity of two English (translated from Spanish) sentences with the systems explained in Section 3.1.",
        "Therefore, we improved the direct translation approach by taking into account the different possible translations for each word in a Spanish sentence.",
        "For that, our system used the information provided by the Google Translate API, that is, all the possible translations for every word of the sentence along with a popularity value.",
        "For each Spanish sentence the system generates all its possible translations by combining the different possible translations of each word.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows three of the English sentences generated for a given Spanish sentence from the trial data.",
        "As a way of controlling the combinatorial explosion of this step, especially for long sentences, we limited the maximum number of generated 2 Notice that both Spanish sentences used the term coj?",

        "The first (Pairing in Table 3) used the pairingWord system with the direct translation of the Spanish sentences to English.",
        "The second run (PairingAvg in Table 3) used the formula for SimSPA(x, y) based on SimENG(x, y) with the pairingWord system.",
        "Finally, the third one (Hulk in Table 3) used the Hulk system with the direct translation.",
        "4 Cross Level Similarity 4.1 Sentence to Paragraph/Phrase We used the three systems developed for the English sentence similarity subtask and described in Section 3.1 for both the sentence to paragraph and sentence to phrase subtasks, producing three runs.",
        "The model for Hulk remained the same (trained on 3750 sentence pairs from MSRvid, MSRpar and headlines dataset) but the SuperSaiyan sys-tem, which is the domain specific approach, used the given train and trial text pairs (about 530) for the respective subtasks as training to generate task specific models.",
        "4.2 Phrase to Word In our initial experiments, we directly computed the phrase-word pair similarity using our English STS.",
        "This yielded a very low correlation of 0.239 for the training set, primarily due to the absence of these phrases and words in our vocabulary.",
        "To address this issue, we used external sources to obtain more contextual information and extracted several features.",
        "Dictionary features.",
        "We used Wordnik as a dictionary resource and retrieved definitions and usage examples for the word.",
        "We then used our English STS system to measure the similarity between these and the given phrase to extract two features.",
        "Web search features.",
        "These features were based on the hypothesis that if a word and phrase have similar meanings, then a web search that combines the word and phrase should return similar documents when compared to a web search for each individually.",
        "We implemented this idea by comparing results of three search queries: the word alone, the phrase alone, and the word and phrase together.",
        "Using the Bing Search API (BIN, 2014), we retrieved the top five results for each search, indexed them with Lucene (Hatcher et al., 2004), and extracted term frequency vectors for each of the three search result document sets.",
        "For the phrase ?spill the beans?",
