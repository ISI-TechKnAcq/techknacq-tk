        "The notion of \"semantic unit\" may be formulated in several ways /1/ so that the application of this term makes its explicit definition indispensable.",
        "It seems that difficulties in defining it arise from the fact that like most general terms it should be related to some definite theory.",
        "At present we do not possess any sufficiently strong and general theory of the semantics of natural languages, though important preliminary steps in this • direction have already been made /2/.",
        "For this reason most semantic investigations of natural languages still preserve the \"artisanlike\" character stressed by M.Coyoud and all definitions of the semantic notions remain rather tentative – as well as all the more general conclusions drawn from such investig&tions.",
        "This, too, holds true for the present contribution, in which an empirical fact is described and some remarks on its possible applications to the problem of the \"true\" multiple meaning have been made.",
        "For this paper it seems advisable to hold apart two notions: that of the \"concept\" and that of the \"semantic unit\".",
        "Given a generative descriptional device G /grammar/ and a projective system of the type proposed by Katz and Fodor S /semantics/ we can describe a semantic concept in aslanr7uae L as a set of n – tuples of symbols.",
        "from G and ordered or partially ordered by the relations which define the formal rules of these systems, and having a common derivation in This broad frame allows us to reard as a concept every dictionary entry – except for' the \"grammatical words\" which do not possess any derivations in LJ – and leaves us a wide margin of freedom in constructing erbitraty \"conce,jt – systems\" with a priori established features.",
        "In a similar way we may describe a semantic unit as a set of n – tuples of G – symbols, G – rules of word formation and :3 – symbols, ordered or partially ordered by means of relations which define the formal rules of these systems, and huvin,;; a common derivation in G from some G – syiubol uniquely related to some 6 – symbol.",
        "This allows us to relate with the notion of a semantic unit the linguistic notions of morpheme /or more strictly: semanteme/ and of \"word family\", defined in terms of grammatical derivations.",
        "The thesauric approach to the problem of meaning .",
        "in LT /s.e.g.3/ pays tribut to the idea of ordering the symbols within the concepts, but at the same time it brings to light the problem of multiple meaning.",
        "This problem has been much discussed already /s.e.z,.4/1 but it is still far from being solved in all its aspects.",
        "Generally speaking the main difficulty arises from the fact that the \"concept – systems\" of languages are not isomorphic and even if we manage to bring them closer tolsether there remains some amount of \"looseness\" within the concepts themselves, giving: rise to the problem of \"true\" multiple meaning.",
        "The \"contextual\" multiple meanin may be resolved.",
        " – in principle, at least – by extending the notion of concepts both the source and in the taret languages to whole sentences or even larger utterances; this is allowed by our \" broad treatment of this notion, not specifyingthe maximal size of the n – tuplee of symbols.",
        "By this extension the inner structure of concepts makes the relations defining the isomorphism of the \"concept – systems\" more apparent; thus even such cases as the adequate translation of the iIussiantiplegel€1440as the English \"chanr;inz /the order of interration/fland \"vaiwing, /argument/\" are theoretically resolvable.",
        "Yet there exist instances where the extension of concept would have to go beyond limits end to involve the whole lunuage: these ore Cases of \"stylistic difference in which there are not apparent reasons for choosin: one of the possible synonyms instead of the other but where the hLfference in distinctly felt by competent bilingual sneakers.",
        "The problem is important for the translation of literary pieces, especially poetry; by the present stand of it is still an academic\" nro'olem, of course, but it exists after all.",
        "It may be best illustrated by the question whether there are \"better'' and \"worse° translations of nonsensical expressions, such as the famous \"furiously sleeping' ideas\".",
        "ne,zative answer would mean that every translation is equally good, which in turn would mean that only \"meaningful\" sentences are translatable; in that case the 1,2 problems would be \"enriched\" with the whole load of philosophical questions - an embarassing development, certainly.",
        "Vaguely felt differences between the intrinsic \"semantic values\" of different elealents of language have :given rise to the notions of \"size\" or \"content\" of Semantic elements /5/ and several attempts - both to define these notions and to furnish models of the underlyinL Jechanism have been made /516/.",
        "The main assumption - based on observations of Mils - was that there existed a \"natural hierarchy\" of concepts in natural lanr4uagesl'forming a tree or at least a lattice with some definite statistical properties.",
        "The present paper gives some results of an in-vest-ation undertaken in order to test this hypotheses.",
        "7Jecauce of the marvelous clarity of the 7;rammatical stl.ucture iirabic has been chosen as a \"laboratory example\".",
        ",:bout 9(1) of semantemes are verbal roots, with very few exce2tions consisting of three consonants' -C3' • the usual dictionary form is the 3d pers.",
        "sz.",
        "masc.",

        "\"he has broken\"/.",
        "There are more than ten different verbs?.",
        "stem-patterns i.e. word formation rules, modyfying the basic meaning of the root in a s..pecific way; thus the stein-pattern II:C,IaC.-,C�aC3aadds to the basic meaning the shade of intensity, e. g. kasara \"to break kassara \"to smash''; the stem-pattern III is conative, the IV - causative, etc.",
        "the triliterL3,1 verbal roots in the -rabLc vocLbulLry have been divided i-hto Se',,arate classes according; to their ability to form s I a dif:ferent",
        "the number of stem – patterns was considered and further ap7licable word formation rules /substantivisations, adjeotivisations etc./ were disregarded this classification is a very rouZn approximation to the hypothetical underlying hierarchy.",
        "It b&S been assumed that the number of stem – patterns defining a Eivon class may be approximately viewed as an exponent of the \"content\" or \"semantic value\" of the semantic units belonsing.to this class and that – if the hypothetical hierarchy was really based on this principle – the number of roots with greater s should be smaller than' that with smaller s. Baranov's Arabic – Russian Dictionary /7/ has been used for counting the roots and it has been found that the relation between s /the number of stem-patterns characterizing the given class/ and r /the number of roots belonsin to this class/ was not only inversly proportional but also nearly functional and that the distribution of roots in the Arabic vocabulary may be described as a simple function r/s/ N/As2 +Bs +C/2 where is the sum – total of roots and A2 B and C are specific constants.",
        "The goodness of fit has been tested by the chi – square distribution and it has been found that the differences between the empirical data and the theoretical distribution – except for one value – do not exceed 0.3 sisnific-ance.level.",
        "In order to estimate the possible differences between particular dictionarins – which could arise from differences between the materials used for their compilation two samples of ca.",
        "700 items each have been taken from two different dictionaries.. /723/ and the distribution of roots in them compared with each other and with the over – all distribution.",
        "All the distributions show a striking similarity, rendering nearly identical chi – square values.x/ This result is a strong argument for the general validity of the discussed distribution in Arabic – and this fact in its turn speaks in favour of the existence of \"natural hierarchies\" of the semantic units in general.",
        "The constants constants for Baranov's Dictionary are: A 0.004419 , B 0.082 , C = 0.3812 It seems very probable that similar regular distributions might be found in other languages, too – perhaps the ensemble of the \"semantic parameters\" would have to be much wider and the \"trial and error\" investigations would require more time but the whole work can be easily mechanised.",
        "The idea of interconnections between the syntactic and semantic structures of language is not new in structural linguistics /s.9 and 10/ and investigations along these lines have already been led in the domain of computational linguistics under direction of P.Garvin /11/.",
        "My suggestions go towards discovering such regular distributions which would facilitate the task of finding more strict correlations between the synonyms within particular concepts on computational basis.",
        "The underlying assumption is that the \"universes of discours\" in various languages are of about the same \"size\" /whatever it would mean – but such an assumption is tacitely made in every translation/, and that the semantic units underlying the components of concepts are ordered according to their \"content\", so that the problem of 'true\" multiple Ileaning in certain cases may be solved by means of matching the components of concepts of the source and target languages on the basis of their \"semantic value\".",
        "As an illustration let us consider a fey!",
        "equivalent English verbs in two different translations /A.",
        "– .",
        "–13/ of the Koranic aura 84, being translations of .,1rabic verbs derived from roots all belonning to the sale class /5 ste.n –patterns/1 i.e. acoordinL tc our assumption hsvin about the s,,we \"selaantic value'.",

        "Thus e.g. for the concept \"applying heat on something\" two different semantic units could have been arbitrarily chosen by the two interpreters, as they regarded tai subsets of synonyms within the concepts as unordered.",
        "4 suggestion is that these subsets might be at least partially ordered by means of the intrinsic value of the semantic units underlying them and that correlations between them might be established in more objective terms of numeric measures of their content."
