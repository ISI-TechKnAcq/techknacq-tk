        "In this paper a discussion on multimodal referent resolution is presented.",
        "The discussion is centered on the analysis of how the referent of an expression in one modality can be found whenever the contextual information required for carrying on such an inference is expressed in one or more different modalities.",
        "In particular, a model for identifying the referent of a graphical expression when the relevant contextual information is expressed through natural language is presented.",
        "The model is also applied to the reciprocal problem of identifying the referent of a linguistic expression whenever a graphical context is given.",
        "In Section 1 of this paper the notion of modality in terms of which the theory is developed is presented.",
        "The discussion is motivated with a case of study in multimodal reference resolution.",
        "In Section 2 a theory for multimodal representation along the lines of Montague's semiotic programme is presented.",
        "In Section 3, an incremental model for multimodal reference resolution is illustrated.",
        "In Section 4 a brief discussion of how the theory could be extended to handle multimodal discourse is advanced.",
        "Finally, in the conclusion of the paper, a reflexion on the relation between spacial deixis and anaphora is advanced.",
        "The figure illustrates a kind of reasoning required to understand multimodal presentations: in order to make sense of the message, the interpreter must realize what individuals are referred to by the pronouns he and it in the text.",
        "For the sake of argument, it is assumed that the graphical symbols in the figure are understood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon, in the same way that the words he, it and washed are understood in terms of the textual lexicon.",
        "It can easily be seen that given the graphical context he should resolve to the man, and it should resolve to the car.",
        "However, this inference is not a valid deduction since the information inferred to is not contained in the overt graphical context and the meaning of the words involved.",
        "One way to look at this problem is as a case of anaphoric inference.",
        "Consider that the information provided by graphical means can be expressed also through the following piece of dicourse: There is a man, a car and a bucket.",
        "He washed it.",
        "With Kamp's discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981, Kamp et.",
        "al.",
        "1993) a discourse representation structure (DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun he is constrained to be the man can be built.",
        "However, the pronoun it has two possible antecedents, and for",
        "selecting the appropriate one, conceptual knowledge is required.",
        "In particular, the knowledge that a man can wash objects with water, and that water is carried on in buckets must be employed.",
        "If these concepts are included in the interpretation context like DRT conditions (which should be retrieved from memory rather than from the normal flow of discourse), the anaphora can be solved.",
        "In terms of this analogy, situations like the one illustrated in Figure 1 have been labeled as problems of anaphor with pictorial antecedent in which the interpretation context is built not from a preceeding text but from a graphical representation which is introduced with the text (Andre et al., 1994).",
        "Consider now the reciprocal situation shown in Figure 2 (adapted from Rist as above) in which a drawing is interpreted as a map thanks to the preceecling text.",
        "The dots and lines of the drawing, and their properties, do not have an interpretation and the picture in itself is meaningless.",
        "However, given the context introduced by the text, and also considering the common sense knowledge that Paris is a city of France, and Frankfurt a city of Germany, and that Germany lies to the east of France (to the right), it is possible to infer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middle and right of the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken and Frankfurt, respectively, and that the dashed lines denote borders of countries, and in particular, the lower segment denotes the border between France and Germany.",
        "In this example, graphical symbols can be thought of as \"variables\" of the graphical representation or \"graphical pronouns\" that can be resolved in terms of the textual antecedent.",
        "Here again, the inference is not a valid deduction as the graphical symbols could be given other interpretations or non at all.",
        "\"Saarbriicken lies at the intersection between the border between France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt.\"",
        "The situation in Figure 2 has been characterised as an instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguistic antecedent, and further related examples can be found in (Andre et al., 1994).",
        "This situation, however, cannot be modeled that easily in terms of Kamp's DRT because the \"pronouns\" are not linguistic objects, and there is not a straight forward way to express in a the discourse representation structure that a dot representing \"a variable\" in the graphical domain has the same denotation as a natural language name or description introduced from text in a DRS.",
        "Furthermore, consider that the situation in Figure 1 can be thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore the modality of the graphics, as was done above, but if the notion of modality is to be considered at all in the analysis, then the situation in Figure 1 poses the same kind of problems as the one in Figure 2.",
        "In general, graphical objects, functioning as constant terms or as variables, introduced as antecendents or as pronouns, cannot be expressed in a DRT, as the rules constructing these structures (the so-called DRS-construction rules) are triggered by specific syntactic configurations of the natural language in which the information is expressed.",
        "An alternative view on this kind of problems consists in looking at them in terms of the traditional linguistic notion of deixis (Lyons, 1968).",
        "This notion has to do with the orientational features of language which are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of an utterance.",
        "In this regard, and in connexion with the notion of graphical anaphor discussed above, it is possible to mention the deictic category of demonstrative pronouns: words like this and that which permit us to make reference to extralinguistic objects with the help of pointing acts.",
        "Ambiguity of this kind of words is not unusual, as they function not only as deictic or demonstrative pronouns but also as anaphoric, if they are preceeded by a linguistic context, and even as determiners with a deictic component as in expressions like this car.",
        "Consider, for instance, that the text in Figure I could be substituted by the expression this washed this where the first this is supported by pointing to the man and the second by pointing to the car.",
        "So, in this line of discussion, it is possible to think of the pronoun it in Figure 1 as a deictic pronuon which refers to the world, although in an indirect manner through a symbol of a different modality.",
        "More generally and according to Kamp (Kamp, 1981): ...deictic and anaphoric pronouns select their referents from certain sets of antecedently available entities.",
        "The two pronouns uses differ with regard to the A Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 101 nature of these sets.",
        "In the case of a deictic pronoun the set contains entities that belong to the real world, whereas the selection set for an anaphoric pronoun is made up of constituents of the representation that has been constructed in response to antecent discourse.",
        "For the purpose of this discussion, it is interesting to question what the nature of the sets mentioned above can be.",
        "In normal deictic situations the use of a demonstrative pronoun is accompanied by a pointing act to an object that can be perceived directly through the visual modality, and as a result of such a visual interpretation process, the object is represented internally by the subject, however, not necessarily through a linguistic representation, but in a representation of a different modality.",
        "According to this, the notion of modality is a representational notion, and not a sensory notion, as it is normally considered in psychological discussion.",
        "In the former sense, a representation is a set of expressions of a formal language; that is to say, with a lexicon and with well-defined syntactic and semantic structures.",
        "The interpretation conventions of an expression of a given modality are determined by the interpreter of the language.",
        "Reasoning with information expressed in both of the modalities is achieved with the help of a translation relation that is similar to the relation of translation between natural languages.",
        "This view of multimodal representation and reasoning can be formalized in terms of Montague's general semiotic programme (Dowty, 1985).",
        "Each modality in the system can be captured through a particular language, and relations between expressions of different modalities can be modeled in terms of translation functions from basic and composite expressions of the source modality into expressions of the object modality.",
        "In a system of this kind, interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2 in relation to the linguistic modality consists in interpreting the information expressed through natural language directly when enough information is available, and completing the interpretation process by means of translating expressions of other modalities into the linguistic one.",
        "Consider Figure 3 – following (Pineda, 1989, 1996) and (Santana et al., 1997) – in which a multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalties is illustrated.",
        "The circles labeled G and L in Figure 3 represent the sets of expressions of the graphical and natural languages respectively; the functions PL and PG stand for the translation mappings between the two languages.",
        "The circle labeled with P represents the set Figure 3 of graphical symbols consituting the graphical modality proper (i.e the actual symbols on a piece of paper or on the screen).",
        "Note that two sets of expressions are considered for the graphical modality: the expressions in G belong to the formal language in which graphics are represented and reasoned about, and are thought of as the \"form\" of the overt graphical symbols whose \"substance\" (in the Saussurean sense) contained in P cannot be manipulated directly.",
        "The set W stands for the world and together with the functions Fp, F6, FL constitutes a multimodal system of interpretation.",
        "The order pair <W, FL> defines the model ML for the natural language, and the order pair <W, F6 ° Fp> defines the model MG for the graphical language.",
        "In order to illustrate how this multimodal system of interpretation works consider, for instance, that the denotations of the picture of a man and the word he in Figure 1 is the same individual in the world; in the same way, the denotations of the word Saarbriicken and the dot on the intersection between the straight line and the lower segment of curve representing the border between France and Germany in Figure 2 are also the same, which is the city of Saarbriicken itself.",
        "So, if one asks who is he?",
        "looking at Figure 1, the answer is found by computing PL(he) whose value is the picture of the man on the figure.",
        "Once this computation is performed the picture can be highlighted or signaled by other graphical means.",
        "If one points out the middle dot in Figure 2 at the time the question what is this?",
        "is asked, on the other hand, the answer is found by applying the function pc to the pointed dot, whose value would be the word SaarbrUcken.",
        "It should be clear that if all theoretical elements illustrated in Figure 3 are given, questions about",
        "multimodal scenarios can be answered through the interpretation process; that is to say, evaluating expressions of a given modality in terms of the interpreters of the languages involved and the translation functions.",
        "However, when one is instructed to interpret a multimodal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not all information in the scheme of Figure 3 is available.",
        "In particular, the translation functions pi, and pc are not known, and the crucial inference of the interpretation process has as its goal to induce these functions.",
        "Such an inference can be thought of as the same process that the one involved in solving the so-called linguistic anaphor with pictorial antecedent and the pictorial anaphor with linguistic antecedent.",
        "It would also be equivalent to finding out deictic references if \"the visual world\" is thought of as represented through expressions of the graphical representation modality.",
        "These are three different ways of looking at the same problem.",
        "It is important to highlight that in order to induce PL and pc the information overtly provided in the multimodal message is usually not enough.",
        "As will be discussed below in this paper, such a process will also require to consider the grammatical structrure of the languages involved, the definition of translations rules between languages, and conceptual knowledge stored in memory about the interpretation domain.",
        "Another consequence of the scheme in Figure 3 is that it provides the basis for generating referring expressions of a given modality in terms of information provided in other modalities.",
        "Consider that basic constants or composite expressions of the languages G and L can be translated to basic or composite expressions of the other language, depending on the definition of the translation function.",
        "So, if ones needs to refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, for instance, it would only be required to find an expression of G which expresses all graphical attributes of the desired object in the most simple fashion, and then translate it to its corresponding expression in L. The resulting natural language expression could be used directly or embbeded in a larger natural language expressions containing words that refer to abstract objects or properties.",
        "To illustrate this point consider the natural language text Saarbriiken lies at the intersection between the border between France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt.",
        "This sentence contains the definite description the intersection between the border between France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt, which in turns contains a number of simplier (basic and composite) referring expressions.",
        "Finding the graphical referent of these expressions requires the identification of dots, lines and curves (and parts of curves) in the map that have the same referent.",
        "However, the map in Figure 2 has graphical entities that have an interpretation but are not named in the text (consider Figure 4 in which the graphical entities of Figure 2 have been labeled).",
        "For instance, Belgium is represented by region r4, and the curve r6 represents the border between France and Belgium.",
        "Once the picture has been interpreted one would be entitle to ask not only for graphical objects that have been named, but also for any meaningful graphical object.",
        "So, if one points to the curve c6 in Figure 2, one answer provided could be The border between France and Belgium.",
        "As some graphical objects named by constants of the graphical language do not have a proper natural language name, the translation function Pc must associate a basic constant of G with a composite description of L. The process of inducing such a translation function produces the corresponding referring expressions too.",
        "Figure 4 In the rest of this paper, some preliminar results of how this programme can be carried out are presented.",
        "In Section 2, a formalization of the languages L and G with their corresponding translation functions and semantic interpretation, along the lines of Montague's general semiotic programme, is presented.",
        "In this section the process of multimodal interpretation and reasoning is explained, and the translation of expressions of one modality in terms of the other is illustrated.",
        "However, such a process can be carried out only if the translation functions are known and, as was mentioned above, that is not normally the case.",
        "In Section 3, some initial results on how such functions can be induced in terms of the multimodal message, constraints on the interpretation conventions of the modalities, and constraints on the general knowledge about the domain, are presented.",
        "In this section the process of generating graphical and linguistic referring A Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 103 expressions, which is associated with the induction of the translation functions, is also illustrated.",
        "In Section 4 a preliminar discussion on the feasibility of extending Kamp's DRS with multimodal structures is presented.",
        "Finally, in the conclusion a tentative reflexion on the relation of anaphora and spacial deixis on the light of such a kind of theory is advanced."

        "In the theory developed in Section 2 it was assumed that the translation of the basic constants of all categories from L to G and vice versa were known, and then multimodal interpretation and reasoning were possible; however, in the interpretation of multimodal messages, natural language and graphics are input from different sources, and working out the meaning of a multimodal message is by no means trivial.",
        "As was discussed in Section 1, solving the graphical anaphora, finding out the reference of deictic pronouns and inducing the translation function are related problems that need to be solved for the interpretation of multimodal messages.",
        "Consider, for instance, the situation of reading a book with words and pictures: when the associations between text and graphical symbols is realized by the reader, the message as a whole has been properly understood.",
        "However, it cannot be A Model for Multirnodal Reference Resolution 113 expected that such an association can be known beforehand.",
        "Inducing this translation function is similar to the computer vision problem of interpreting drawings.",
        "A related antecedent is the work on the logic of depiction (Reiter et al., 1987) in which a logic for the interpretation of maps to be applied in computer vision and intelligent graphics is developed.",
        "It is argued that any adequate representation scheme for visual (and computer graphics) knowledge must mantain the distinction between knowledge of the image (the graphics) and knowledge of the scene (its interpretation), and about the depiction relation.",
        "In Reiter's system two sets of first order logical sentences representing the scene and the image are employed, and express, respectively, the conceptual and geometrical knowledge about hand drawn sketch maps of geographical regions.",
        "The depiction relation corresponds to the translation function between constants of L and G discussed above.",
        "An interpretation in Reiter's system is defined as a model, in the logical sense, of both sets of sentences and the depiction relation, and interpreting a drawing consists in finding out all possible models of such sets of sentences.",
        "Although computing the set of models of a set of first order sentences is computationally untractable problem, the entities constituting a drawing conform, normally, a finite set which is often small.",
        "So, the possibility of computing the set of models of a drawings is a matter for empirical research.",
        "In particular, Reiter's system employs a constraint satistaction algorithm to find out all possible interpretation of maps, and the output of his system is a set of labels for curves or chains as rivers, roads or shores, and for areas as land regions or water regions.",
        "As was mentioned above, to find the translation functions between G and L is a similar problem with the same kind of complexity.",
        "As a side effect of working out the translation between basic graphical and linguistic constants, a method for generating natural language expressions that refer to graphical objects and configurations is at hand.",
        "Consider that a natural language description can have both simple and composite referring expression that translate into basic graphical constants, and inducing the linguistic translation of a graphical term which has not been named is the same as generating a linguistic description for such an object.",
        "Next, an algorithm for constructing the translations is illustrated.",
        "As a preliminar consideration it is important to highlight that such translations cannot be built with the overt information expressed through the multimodal message.",
        "For working out the interpretation of Figure 2, for instance, it is required, in addition to the text and graphics, knowledge about the geography of Europe and also knowledge about interpretation conventions of maps.",
        "To find out the translation such knowledge must be employed.",
        "The conventions about the interpretation of maps are expressed as a correspondence between graphical and conceptual types, for instance, that dots represent cities and regions represent countries.",
        "General knowledge about maps, either geometrical or conceptual, will constraint the possible translation.",
        "The algorithm for computing the translation function has two parts; the purpose of the first is to assign a graphical constant to all terms in the overt textual message according to the grammar of L, and the second is to assign a referring expression to the remaining graphical constants of the drawing.",
        "For the example in Figure 2, the output of the first part is shown in Figure 11.",
        "The second part would assign a description to the remaining graphical constants as shown in Figure 12.",
        "For the definition of the algorithm a function table for representing the set of possible functions from graphical to linguistic constants of the corresponding semantic types is defined.",
        "The interpretation conventions for maps are stated through the order pairs in the following set: / = (<dot, city>, <region, country>, <curve, border>, <line, line>).",
        "The function table for the first pair in relation to Figure 2 and 4 is shown in Figure 13.",
        "As can be seen the function table in Figure 13 relates all dots to all cities in the text.",
        "As any dot can represent any city, but different cities are represented by different dots, each dot must be associated to one city by filling the box in which the dot intersects the corresponding city in the function table.",
        "Considering that once a dot has been assigned to a city, the row corresponding to that city cannot be filled out for the other dots.",
        "According to this, if there are n cities, the first dot receiving an interpretation can be assigned in n different ways (it can represents one of the n cities), the second in n-1 different ways, etc.",
        "As a consequence, each function map represents n!",
        "possible interpretation functions (if all cities are represented).",
        "The first step in the algorithm is to identify all graphical and linguistic basic constants from the overt message and draw the function tables for the interpretation conventions set I.",
        "In our example basic linguisctic constants referring to graphical objects (proper names) name cities and countries, and only a function table for region representing countries (in addition to Figure 13) is considered as shown in Figure 14.",
        "The next step is to fill out tables in Figures 13 and 14 with all possible interpretations that are consistent with the overt knowledge and also the background knowledge about the interpretation task, in this case knowledge about the geography of Europe.",
        "The general knowledge to be considered for this example is shown in Figure 15.",
        "Note that clauses 1 to 6 are general knowlege of geography, but clause 7 is introduced explicitly in the multimodal message.",
        "Note as well that there might be a considerable amount of knowledge about the geography of Europe which is not included in Figure 15.",
        "However, how knowledge is brought about to the interpretation process is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The only consideration is that the range values of the function tables are the main indices that somehow retrieve the information from memory.",
        "For filling out the function tables th set of all constraints should be considered.",
        "As shown by Reiter (Reiter et al., 1987) all possible models can be found – for a finite set of graphical symbols – with a constraint satisfaction algorithm.",
        "Along this line, we are exploring strategies to find out the set of models incrementally extending the function tables filling out one column of one table at a time by considering one constraint at a time.",
        "This is done in a way that the extended model satisfies all constraints considered so far.",
        "The process continues until all function tables are filled out.",
        "For the example, propositions 3 to 7 are considered to produce the function tables illustrated in Figure 16.",
        "Note, in particular, that if proposition 7 is not considered a diagonal model for the intepretation of dots would also be admissible.",
        "The next step of the algorithm consists in identifying the translations of composite referring expressions to complete table in Figure 11.",
        "This can be done with the help of the grammar, the translation functions, the semantic interpretation of G and the translations already computed in Figure 16.",
        "In fact, once the translation of basic constants is known the translation of composite terms using those constants can be found compositionally in terms of the translation rules from L to G and the interpretation rules of G. Consider, additionally, that the translation for basic constants for other categories is given beforehand as shown in Figure 6.",
        "For instance, the translation of the composite expression the border between France and Germany into G is",
        "to produce the final value which is, due to the type rising of terms, the set of properties that ci has, and for simplicity we take it to be the constant cl.",
        "Next, the second part of the algorithm producing the translation of the set UNNAMED of graphical constants that have no name, as shown in Figure 12, is described.",
        "In order to carry out this process, the first step is to identify the types of all constants in UNNAMED with the help of the type predicates of G. For each constant it is required to identify all geometrical functions producing objects of the constant type.",
        "So, the same constant may be produced by a number of ways depending on the geometrical functions available for producing objects of the constant type.",
        "The next step consists in identifying all combinations of expressions that can be used as arguments of geometrical functions, forming in this way a set of expressions that can produce the constant at hand.",
        "Each of these expressions is interpreted.",
        "From this process two kinds of outputs can be expected: either the expression has a well-defined value or it does not.",
        "Expressions having a proper value must be combined with a graphical quantifier, and probably with other expressions of G (to produce the between` term from the geometrical function curve_between).",
        "The resulting term can be translated back into the natural language, producing in this way the corresponding description.",
        "Suppose it is desired to find a referring expression of the constant cl of graphical type curve.",
        "Considering all geometrical functions denoted by the basic constants of G, only curve and curve_between can produce curves.",
        "The constant curve denotes the set of curves on the drawing, so the expressions XPA,Q3xfP(x) A Q(x)1(curve) – a border – and A.PA.Q3yrdx[P(x) 44 1=y] A Q(y)licurve) – the border – can be formed; the interpretation of the former expression results in the set of properties that one curve or another has, including the properties of curve c1; however, the intepretation of the last expression results in an empty set as there is more than one curve in the drawing.",
        "So, only the former expression generated by the constant curve is a possible description of ci.",
        "If the constant curve_between is considered, the expressions shown in Figure 16 can be obtained (the expressions denoting empty sets – as between*OLP[P(r1)]) AP[P(ri)]) curve) – where omitted).",
        "As can be seen, only the first of these expressions refers to the curve denoted by cf.",
        "Thus, the expressions a border, a border between France and Germany and the border between France and Germany are possible descriptions for cl.",
        "The pragmatic choice of which expression is the most appropriate in an interpretation context goes beyond the scope of this paper; here we are only concerned with the computation of the set of expressions that can be correctly produced in terms of the multimodal representation.",
        "This procedure has one additional complication that has to be taken into account.",
        "Once a graphical object has been produced by the procedure mentioned above it can also extend the set of the argument combinations of the graphical functions referring to other well-formed graphical objects.",
        "Note that it is possible to produce very large expressions and even infinite ones with the unconstrained recursive application of the procedure.",
        "It could be possible to produce, for instance, the border between France and Germany",
        "between France and Germany between France and Germany.",
        "This expression is well-formed and denotes the border between France and Germany.",
        "In order to prevent these kind of very large expressions an algorithm for generating the set of simplest but maximally expressive expressions of a graphical language has been proposed (Santana, 1995)."

        "To work out such a theory is quite an ambitious goal, however, in the same way that DRT focuses in internal structural processes that govern anaphoric resolution, it is plausible to consider a multimodal discourse representation theory (MDRT) to cope with referential aspects of multimodal communication.",
        "In the same way that DRT postulates discourse representation structures in which referents and conditions are introduced incrementally through the interpretation of the incoming natural language discourse through the application of construction rules, it is plausible to conceive similar multimodal discourse representation structures (MDRS) whose referents and conditions would be introduced by modality depending construction rules acting upon the expressions of the corresponding modality.",

        "In these structures, DRS-conditions extracted from different modalities would be kept in separate partitions, but the discourse referents would be abstract objects common to the whole MDRS.",

        "It was argued that in more traditional lines such a problem can be thought of, alternativelly, as the resolution of spacial indexical referents.",

        "It was also illustrated an algorithm for finding out such a translation relation when text and graphics are introduced through independent input channels, and the translation between constants must be induced dynamically.",

        "This extension would permit to capture an aspect of spacial deixis which is currently beyond the scope of DRT.",
        "If the notion of multimodal discourse representation structures is developed along the lines suggested in this paper, Kamp's demarcation between anaphoric and deictic uses of pronouns could be formally captured, as the sets of antecedents taken from the world would be incorparted as referents and conditions of a MDRS: while the antecedents for anaphoric pronouns taken from preceeding text are accesible for pronouns, deictic antecedents would be accesible via translation functions."
