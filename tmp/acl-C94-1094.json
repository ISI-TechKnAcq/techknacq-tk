      "text": [
        "The past few years have seen a burst of activity in the development of statistical methods which, applied to massive text data, have in turn enabled the development of increasingly comprehensive and robust models of language structure and use.",
        "Such models are increasingly recognized as an invaluable resource for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation.",
        "The upsurge of interest in empricial methods for language modelling has led inevitably to a need for massive collections of texts of all kinds, including text collections which span genre, register, spoken and written data, etc., as well as domain or application-specific collections, and, especially, multilingual collections with parallel translations.",
        "In the latter half of the 1980's, very few appropriate or adequately large text collections existed for use in computational linguistics research, especially for languages other than English.",
        "Consequently, several efforts to collect and disseminate large mono and multilingual text collections have been recently established, including the ACL Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI), the European Corpus Initiative (ECI), which has developed a multilingual, partially parallel corpus, the U.S. Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), RELATOR and MULTEXT in Europe, etc. (see Armstrong-Warwick, 1993).",
        "It is widely recognized that such efforts constitute only a beginning for the necessary data collection and dissemination efforts, and that considerable work to develop adequately large and appropriately constituted textual resources still remains.",
        "The demand for extensive reusability of large text collections in turn requires the development of standardized encoding formats for this data.",
        "It is no longer realistic to distribute data in ad hoc formats, since the effort and resources required to clean up and reformat the data for local use is at best costly, and in many cases prohibitive.",
        "Because much existing and potentially available data was originally formatted for the purposes of printing, the information explicitly represented in the encoding concerns a particular physical realization of a text rather than its logical structure (which is of greater interest for most NEP applications), and the correspondence between the two is often difficult or impossible to establish without substantial work.",
        "Further, as data become more and more available and the use of large text collections become more central to NLP research, general and publicly available software to manipulate the texts is being developed which, to be itself reusable, also requires the existence of a standard encoding format.",
        "A standard encoding format adequate for representing textual data for NLP research must he (I) capable of representing the different kinds of information across the spectrum of text types and languages potentially of interest to the NLP research community, including prose, technical documents, newspapers, verse, drama, letters, dictionaries, lexicons, etc.",
        "; (2) capable of representing different levels of information, including not only physical characterstics and logical structure (as well as other more complex phenomena such as Mira and inter-textual references, alignment of parallel elements, etc.",
        "), but also interpretive or analytic annotation which may he added to the data (for example, markup for part of speech, syntactic structure, etc.",
        "); (3) application independent, that is, it must provide the required flexibility and generality to enable, possibly simultaneously, the explicit encoding of potentially disparate types of information within the same text, as well as accomodate all potential types of processing.",
        "The development of such a suitably flexible and comprehensive encoding system is a substantial intellectual task, demanding (just to start) the development of suitably complex models for the various text types as well as an overall model of text and an architecture for the encoding scheme that is to embody it."

        "In 1988, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was established as an international cooperative research project to develop a general and flexible set of guidelines for the preparation and interchange of electronic texts.",
        "The TEI is jointly sponsored by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing.",
        "The project has had major support from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Directorate XIII of the Commission of the European Communities (CEC/DGXIII), the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",
        "In January 1994, the TEI issued its Guidelines for the Encoding and Interchange of Machine-Readable Texts, which provide standardized encoding conventions for a large range of text types and features relevant for a broad range of applications,' including natural language processing, information retrieval, hypertext, electronic publishing, various forms of literary and historical analysis, lexicography, etc.",
        "The Guidelines are intended to apply to texts, written or spoken, in any natural language, of any date, in any genre or text type, without restriction on form or content.",
        "They treat both continuous materials (running text) and discontinuous materials such as dictionaries and linguistic corpora.",
        "As such, the TEI Guidelines answer the fundamental needs of a wide range of users: researchers in computational linguistics, the humanities, sciences, and social sciences; publishers; librarians and those concerned generally with document retrieval and storage; as well as the growing language technology community, which is amassing substantial multi-lingual, multi-modal corpora of spoken and written texts and lexicons in order to advance research in human language understanding, production, and translation.",
        "The rules and recommendations made in the TEI Guidelines conform to the ISO 8879, which defines the Standard Generalized Markup Language, and ISO 646, which defines a standard seven-bit character set in terms of which the recommendations on character-level interchange are formulated.1 SGML is an increasingly widely recognized international markup standard which has been adopted by the US Department of Defense, the Commission of European Communities, and numerous publishers and holders of large public databases."

        "features, a choice of frameworks or bases, and a wide variety of optional additions for specific applications or text types.",
        "The encoding process is seen as incremental, so that additional markup may be easily inserted in the text.",
        "Because the TEI is an SGML application, a TEI conformant document must be described by a document type definition (DTD), which defines tags and provides a BNF grammar description of the allowed structural relationships among them.",
        "A TEI DTD is composed of the core tagsets, a single base tagset, and any number of user selected additional tagsets, built up according to a set of rules documented in the TEI Guidelines.",
        "At the highest level, all TEI documents conform to a common model.",
        "The basic unit is a text, that is, any single document or stretch of natural language regarded as a self-contained unit for processing purposes.",
        "The association of such a unit with a header describing it as a bibliographic entity is regarded as a single TEI element.",
        "Two variations on this basic structure arc defined: a collection of TEI elements, or a variety of composite texts.",
        "The first is appropriate for large disparate collections of independent texts such as language corpora or collections of unrelated papers in an archive.",
        "The second applies to cases such as the complete works of a given author, which might be regarded simultaneously as a single text in its own right and as a series of independent texts.",
        "It is often necessary to encode more than one view of a text--for example, the physical and the linguistic or the formal and the rhetorical.",
        "One of the essential features of the TEI Guidelines is that they offer the possibility to encode many different views of a text, simultaneously if necessary.",
        "A disadvantage of SGML is that it uses a document model consisting of a single hierarchical structure.",
        "Often, different views of a text define multiple, possibly overlapping hierarchies (for example, the physical view of a print version of a text, consisting of pages subdivided into physical lines, and the logical view consisting of, for example, paragraphs subdivided into sentences) which are not readily accomodated by SGML's document model.",
        "The TEI has identified several possible solutions to this problem in addition to SGML's concurrent structures mechanism, which, because of the processing complexity it involves, is not a thoroughly satisfactory alternative.",
        "The TEI Guidelines provide sophisticated mechanisms for linking and alignment of elements, both within a given text and between texts, as well as links to data not in the form of ASCII text such as sound and images.",

        "To accomodate this variety, the constituents of all divisions of a TEI text element are not defined explicitly, but in terms of SGML parameter entities, which behave similar to a variable declaration in a programming language: the effect of using them here is that each base tag set can provide its own specific definition for the constituents of texts, which can he modified by the user if desired."
