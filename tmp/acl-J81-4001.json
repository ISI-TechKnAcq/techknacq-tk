        "Traditionally researchers have defined the problem of comprehending anaphoric expressions as one of determining the antecedent of an anaphoric expression, that is, determining to which word or phrase an anaphoric expression refers or \"points\".",
        "Recent studies in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have demonstrated the need for a theory of the comprehension of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for the role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as inferential knowledge in explaining how anaphors are understood.",
        "In this paper a new theory, based on the concept of focusing in the discourse, is introduced to explain the interpretation of pronouns.",
        "Before a theory can be given, and before even the difficulties in interpreting anaphors2 can be discussed,",
        "we must first reconsider what an antecedent is.",
        "The traditional definition encounters difficulty right from the start; it is founded on the notion that one word in a sentence refers or points back to another word or phrase in the (same or another) sentence.",
        "But words don't refer back to other words [Morgan 1978]; people use words to refer to entities in the world.",
        "In particular they use pronouns to refer to entities which have already been mentioned in a discourse.",
        "Since an anaphoric phrase does not refer to an antecedent, one might want to claim that both the antecedent and the anaphor co-refer to the same entity.",
        "That description is adequate for sentence s 1, s 1 I think green apples taste best and they make the best cooking apples too.",
        "though not for discourse D1, where there is no antecedent phrase in the discourse that co-refers with the pronoun \"they.\" D1-1 My neighbor has a monster Harley 1200.",
        "2 They are really huge but gas-efficient bikes.",
        "Rather than view antecedence as co-reference, one might propose that antecedence is a kind of cognitive pointing, the kind of pointing that causes \"they\" and \"green apples\" to point (somehow) to the same class of entities in one's mind.",
        "This proposal is problematic for the same reason that co-reference is: people use pronouns when there is no other noun phrase in the Copyright 1981 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made for direct commercial advantage and the Journal reference and this copyright notice are included on the first page.",
        "To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission.",
        "discourse that points to the right mental entity.",
        "In D1, \"they\" refers to bikes which are Harley 1200's as a group, while \"a monster Harley 1200\" mentions only some particular Harley 1200.",
        "\"They\" seems to be able to refer when used with the previously mentioned phrase \"a monster Harley 1200\" without the two phrases either co-referring or co-pointing.",
        "If an anaphor does not refer to an antecedent phrase, and if it need not always co-refer with its apparent antecedent (as in D1), then anaphor interpretation is not simply finding the antecedent.",
        "Nevertheless the concept of antecedence as pointing back does seem to capture some aspect of the comprehension of anaphors, for when certain antecedent words are missing from a discourse, people often fail to understand what is being said.",
        "Let us define the problem of interpreting and understanding an anaphor in the following way.",
        "The phrase \"green apples\" in s 1 , when syntactically and semantically interpreted, is said to specify a cognitive element in the hearer's mind.",
        "In the computational model of that process, this element is a database item, which might be represented by Apples2 in by the schema below: Phrase76: string: \"green apples\" context: speaker 1 think * tastes best specifies: Apples2 Apples2: super-concept: apples color: green used-for: cooking The speaker uses the information in a cognitive representation like Apples2 above to choose the phrase \"green apples\" in s 1 .",
        "The hearer then uses the phrase \"green apples\" plus the syntactic and semantic interpretation of the rest of the sentence to locate a similar cognitive element in his own mind; it may be slightly different because the hearer may not associate use in cooking with green apples.",
        "A cognitive element, such as Apples2, is called the specification of \"green ap-ples.\" These elements, present in the memories of speaker and hearer, are of course related to other cognitive elements in their memories.",
        "What is the relation of specifications to the real world?",
        "One might like to claim that a reference relation exists between specified cognitive elements and objects in the world, but since referring is what people do with words, this relation is problematic for cognitive elements.",
        "Instead, specifications are said to represent the objects referred to; that is, they bear a well-structured correspondence to objects in the world.",
        "Apples2, the specification of \"green apples,\" represents the objects that are green apples.",
        "For phrases such as \"Santa Claus,\" where there is no real world object to represent, a specification represents the mental schema to which are attached the properties normally associated with this imaginary person.",
        "The phrase \"they\" in s1 also specifies a cognitive element, namely the same one that \"green apples\" does.",
        "Since the two bear the same relation to the representation Apples2, I say that they \"co-specify\" that memory element, or alternatively, that the interpretation of \"green apples\" is the co-specifier of the interpretation of \"they.\" Co-specification, unlike co-reference, allows one to construct abstract representations and define relationships between them which can be studied in a computational framework.",
        "With co-reference no such use is possible, since the object referred to exists in the world and is not available for examination by computational processes.",
        "Even if a phrase and a pronoun do not co-specify, the specification of the phrase may be used to generate the specification of a pronoun.",
        "For example, in DI.",
        "\"they\" does not co-specify with the apparent antecedent phrase \"a monster Harley 1200,\" but rather it refers to the class of Harley 1200's of which the apparent antecedent is an instance.",
        "Thus anaphor interpretation is not simply a matter of finding the corresponding cognitive element that serves as the specification of the anaphor; some additional process must generate a specification for the anaphor from the related phrase \"a monster Harley 1200.\" The concepts of specification and co-specification capture the \"pointing back\" quality of antecedence, and also permit us to formulate an explanation of anaphor interpretation that avoids the pitfalls of the concept of antecedence.",
        "Anaphor interpretation can be studied as a computational process that uses the already existing specification of a phrase to find the specification for an anaphor.",
        "The process uses a representation of the discourse preceding the anaphor to encode the syntactic and semantic relationships in each sentence as well as co-specification relationships between phrases.",
        "These definitions in themselves do not constitute a theory of anaphor interpretation.",
        "They do, however, make possible a succinct statement of the problem: how does one determine the specification of a anaphor?",
        "Also, since we suspect that the specification of an apparent antecedent phrase plays some role in choosing an anaphor's specification, we may ask, just what is this role?",
        "We hope for a direct answer to these questions, but before one can be given, let us consider how a theory of interpretation ought to address these questions.",
        "A brief look at the",
        "difficulties of choosing co-specifiers suggests which issues our theory should cover.",
        "Determining the co-specifier of an anaphor is difficult because there are a multitude of possible co-specifiers in a given discourse, and there is no simple way to choose the correct one.",
        "Yet human hearers and readers generally do recover the correct co-specifying phrase intended by the speaker.",
        "Human readers and hearers also fail to recover the co-specifying phrase in certain situations; this behavior is just as valuable an observation as garden path phenomena for theories of parsing.",
        "A theory of interpretation must predict the pattern of the hearer's and reader's correct and incorrect choices, as well as failures to understand, by a rule-governed account.",
        "In addition, a taxonomy of the cases in which specifications are used to generate other specifications must be given, as well as a means of predicting their distribution.",
        "Two other aspects of communication make it difficult to find co-specifiers: the context of discussion and the inferences people make.",
        "People use the context surrounding an anaphor in understanding it.",
        "If a theory of anaphor interpretation is to capture understanding, it must include a means of encoding discourse context and whatever structure it has; the context must be distilled into a form that preserves its richness without adding overwhelming complexity to the interpretation process.",
        "In addition, researchers have discovered that anaphor interpretation involves making inferences, some of which can be complex, each of which must be chosen from a large base of knowledge about objects, people and things.",
        "The practical deployment of inferential capabilities for any task requires control: knowing what to infer when, and knowing when to stop.",
        "Since the general control problem is poorly understood, a theory of anaphor interpretation must provide solutions to the more specific problem of controlling inference in anaphor interpretation.",
        "The major portion of this paper addresses the issues of determining the specifications of anaphors, with an emphasis on the role of context and inference.",
        "The theory of focusing on parts of the discourse is introduced, and a processor and its rules which rely on the focusing theory are discussed.",
        "Before turning to this discussion, the previous and extensive research on anaphora are reviewed."

        "Syntactic and semantic constraints on anaphora [Katz & Fodor 1963, Woods et al.",

        "Analysis of relations among objects in a discourse context [Grosz 1977, Lockman 1978, Reichman 1978, Webber 1978, Hobbs 1979]",
        "Rather than review each approach, I point out the contributions of each type to a theory of pronoun interpretation.",
        "General heuristics, as a means of choosing antecedents, predict reliably in a large number of typical examples.",
        "However, no simple characterization fits the wide variety of cases where they fail (see Winograd 1972 and Hobbs 1977); furthermore, the heuristic approach is not theoretically grounded and cannot offer a unified approach to the phenomena.",
        "Semantic selectional restrictions, based on the Katz-Fodor theory of semantic markers, and used by many computational linguists, can reduce the space of possible antecedents, but they cannot be used to eliminate all possibilities, as the example below illustrates (where feeling soft can be said of either a mud pack or one's face): s2 Put the mud pack on your face.",
        "Notice how soft it feels.",
        "Syntactic restrictions, on logical form [Chomsky 1976] and on constituent structure [Lasnik 1976, Reinhart 1976], stipulate conditions in which a pronoun and a noun phrase must have disjoint reference, as shown below.",
        "s3 * Near Dan, he saw a snake.",
        "s4 * The man whose house he bought went gold digging in Alaska.",
        "These rules, however, do not stipulate the interpretation of a pronoun; in a general theory they serve only as a filtering condition on the class of possible co-specifications.",
        "Furthermore, syntactic restrictions must also stipulate the disjoint reference conditions on reflexive pronouns although no adequate account of these conditions has yet appeared.",
        "Work by researchers in artificial intelligence on inference led to methods for forward and backward chaining of inferences to bind the pronoun, represented as a free variable, with some piece of knowledge; with this approach, the pronoun's interpretation was the value bound to the free variable.",
        "This approach revealed that inferences about world knowledge are often needed to interpret pronouns.",
        "However, these methods failed to control the inference process sufficiently.",
        "Charniak, attempting to resolve this problem, proposed demons that would \"wake up\" in the appropriate situation (that is, processes which could themselves notice when they were to begin processing).",
        "But a large cache of demons would be required, and no assurance could be given that demons would exist in every situation.",
        "Most significantly, this proposal said nothing about the situation where two or more demons might apply (who gets control?",
        "how are the decisions made?).",
        "Furthermore all of the inference-based approaches to pronoun interpretation fail to offer any theoretical approach because they rely on a simple mechanism, (simple variable binding between pronoun and some other phrase) which does not apply in many uses of anaphors, such as D 1.",
        "Discourse approaches to anaphora include a technique similar to the inference method; one identifies sentence pairs and determines their semantic relationship as one of elaboration, similarity, contrast, parallel structure; the pronouns are interpreted by variable binding between items of the sentence pairs [Hobbs 1979].",
        "Webber 1978, using a notion of \"discourse identifications\" (that contain certain semantic and discourse content) similar to the notion of specification, stipulates constraints on the representation of relations among items mentioned in a discourse.",
        "Grosz [1977, 1978, 1981] illustrates how parts of a speaker's knowledge, relevant to a discourse segment, are highlighted via focusing, a process that reflects what a speaker says and the nature of the knowledge in the space.",

        "How does the hearer determine the interpretation of a pronoun, i.e., how does a hearer decide which highly focused items act as the co-specification of a pronoun?",

        "A process model of focusing and focus tracking consists of three distinct processors.",
        "The first chooses foci based on what the speaker initially says.",
        "The algorithm for this choice depends on many phenomena – see Sidner 1979 for details.",
        "Then an interpreter (the pronoun interpreter) uses these foci and a set of rules of pronoun interpretation (hereafter \"pi-rules\") to interpret the anaphoric expressions in the discourse.",
        "This interpreter, like a human hearer, must keep in mind whatever other newly mentioned elements the speaker has introduced, since sometimes an anaphor may co-specify with one of those instead of the elements in focus.",

        "In fact, the model is not circular, but its steps are cyclic.",
        "The processor cycles through the three processes for each sentence in the discourse.",

        "The speaker's concluding sentence expands the discourse focus back to both dogs with the use of \"them.\" In Sidner 1979 a machine for choosing and updating the discourse focus and actor focus is given.",
        "The machine chooses items in the discourse to serve as \"expected\" foci after the first sentence of a discourse and uses the interpretation of pronouns as well as non-pronoun anaphors to determine whether its expected choices were correct.",

        "In the remaining discussion, it is assumed that the focus machine can determine a discourse and an actor focus.",

        "What rules are used by the pronoun interpreter?",
        "How do these rules make use of the constraints on the theory of pronoun interpretation discussed earlier in this paper?",
        "The focusing theory of pronoun interpretation can be outlined as follows.",
        "At any time in the discourse after the first sentence, there are foci that are the prime candidates for co-specifying with a pronoun.",
        "Also available is a list of alternate candidates, called potential foci, for each focus.",
        "Unless the focus candidate is ruled out by certain criteria (to be discussed below), the pronoun interpreter uses it to determine the specification of the pronoun.",

        "The proposal made here contains two implicit processing assumptions, (1) serial processing, and (2) end-of-sentence processing.",
        "By \"serial processing\", I mean that the interpreter checks a focus as a candidate in interpreting the pronoun, and then if that focus is unacceptable, checks alternate candidates in turn.",
        "By \"end-of-sentence processing\", I mean that pronouns are not interpreted until the entire sentence has been syntactically and semantically interpreted.",
        "Both of these criteria could be given up without undermining the focusing theory.",
        "One could envision processing in parallel by checking the foci and alternates and then determining the pronoun's specification from an ordering of all those candidates that meet the criteria of choice.",
        "To interpret pronouns before the end of the sentence, the interpreter could decide using available information and then review its choice as more of the sentence is processed.",
        "These two implicit processing assumptions have been made because they simplify the account of focus and because they reflect an implemented version of one focus system.",

        "None of these potentials survives long into the discourse as D3-3 fails to pick up on any of them.",
        "D3-3 in turn introduces some other potential foci, and one of them, ice cream cones, is discussed in D3-4; notice also that D3-4 fails to mention baseball in any way.",

        "Potential foci are ordered according to their thematic relation7 in a sentence, with semantic case objects first, and agents last.",
        "The first potential focus that meets all the constraints is chosen as the co-specifier; in D3, ice cream cones is the first acceptable potential focus that meets all the necessary constraints as a co-specifier for \"they.\" Use of this modified pronoun rule follows hand-in-hand with the focus machine discussed previously.",
        "The machine updates its discourse model after each sentence by tracking, among other things, pronoun use.",
        "When a pronoun is used to co-specify with a phrase that is a potential focus, and no phrase co-specifies the current focus, either the discourse focus or actor focus moves to that potential focus.",
        "Which of the two foci moves depends on whether the pronoun fills the agent case in the verb frame, and in the case of multiple agent cases, whether the ongoing actor focus is re-mentioned.",
        "For example, after D3-4, the discourse focus changes to ice cream cones because \"they\" co-specifies with the ice cream cones; the boys remain the actor focus, since \"they\" is not an agent case for \"taste\" and since the boys were already the actor focus.",
        "So far pi-rules take into account the movement of focus and constraints on syntax, semantics and pragmatics.",
        "However, some of the semantic and pragmatic criteria must be expanded beyond the simple case frame semantics and representation of noun phrases given earlier.",
        "As the reader may have concluded, the interaction between actor and discourse foci is a complex one; to supplement the case frame semantics, some functional notion of theme (in the sense of functionalists such as Halliday 1967) is needed.",
        "For example, the proper co-specifier for the pronoun in D4-3 cannot be chosen with R2 and only simple case frame relations.",

        "With such a rule, Jeff is chosen as the co-specifier of \"he,\" not because Carl couldn't have gone to the Cape with Linda, but because the speaker is talking about Jeff and his thoughts about Jeff.",
        "In essence this approach takes the discourse focus as primary, the discourse focus being what the speaker is talking about so far, while the actor focus is the locus of information about actions in the discourse.",
        "The theme-focus rule does not indicate what to do when the discourse focus and actor focus are both animate, have the same gender, number and person, and are both established during the same sentence of the discourse.",

        "It appears that in such cases the ambiguity may not be easily resolved unless additional information about the two foci is known that stipulates that the sentence is true of only one.",
        "Potential foci can be sub-categorized as either potential discourse foci or as potential actor foci.",
        "A potential actor is a noun phrase which specifies a database element marked as animate and which does not occur in agent position.",
        "In most sentences, the noun phrase in agent position contains a descriptive word or name in the head, and specifies a database element; it becomes the actor focus.",
        "But when the noun phrase in agent position is a pronoun, it may co-specify with either the actor focus (if one exists), or a potential actor.",

        "Such a behavior suggests that the inference mechanism should be able to judge preferences between a given actor and one potential actor.",

        "A computational framework for carrying out such subtle judgments is still beyond the state of the art, although Marcus 1980 has proposed a semantic choice mechanism that must also weigh evidence for prepositional phrase attachment; his parser, when attaching prepositional phrases, asks the semantic processor about its preferences for where to attach the phrases.",

        "The initial focus after the first sentence is Whitierleaf, but the parallel syntactic structure of the sentences seems to govern a different choice of co-specifier.",
        "To summarize, between similarity of structure and the pi-rules, similarity is preferred as a means of choosing a co15 Hobbs 1979 defines a parallel relation between sentences sO and S1 of a discourse as occurring when propositions PO and P1, which follow from SO and S1 respectively, have identical predicates, and arguments that are similar (p. 76).",
        "This concept of a parallel relation seems related to my intuitive characterization, but as defined does not capture the cases I discuss.",
        "specifier, so when each gives a different prediction, similarity of structure must be used.",
        "D13-1 The green Whitierleaf is most commonly found near the wild rose.",
        "2 The wild violet is found near it too.",
        "At first glance it appears that the pi-rules could be \"fixed\" by simply observing that the initial focus is wrong and that a potential focus should be chosen.",
        "However, no such option is available, for such a \"fix\" requires that the inference machine reject the initial focus.",
        "To do so, the inference mechanism needs some knowledge about the world that indicates the unacceptability.",
        "For D13 no such knowledge could possibly be forthcoming since all the flora involved are found near one another.",
        "There is no knowledge to the effect that violets are found near wild roses and not near Whitierleafs.16 Another example of parallel structures is shown in D14.",
        "The parallel structures again are reflected in the similarity of the syntactic forms as well as the semantics of \"most\" and \"mine\".",
        "After D14-1, the initial focus is the car radiator that is associated with each car of \"most cars.\" Using the focusing rules, the pronoun interpreter will take \"it\" to co-specify with that radiator.",
        "But this prediction is incorrect; \"it\" co-specifies with the radiator of the speaker's car.17 D14-1 On most cars the radiator has a free bolt hook.",
        "2 But on mine, it has a floating bolt hook.",
        "The use of \"it\" here is similar to the instance of a prototype for \"it\" in D8.",
        "The two discourse examples differ because D14-2 has an underlying semantic form that parallels D14-1.",
        "D14-1 specifies a universal set of cars and says something about one of the parts for those cars; D14-2 specifies a set of one thing, the speaker's car, and says something about a part of it; the speaker's car is related to the universal car by instantiation.",
        "Thus \"it\" in D14-2 is not pointing to some instance of the prototypic radiator; it co-specifies with the radiator of the speaker's car, but \"it\" is related intensionally to the \"radiator\" in D141.",
        "The similarity in the underlying semantics of D14-1 and D14-2 must be used in interpreting the pronoun uses.",
        "One might wish to construct some special-purpose mechanism that looks for similarities in structure between two sentences.",
        "This method is doomed for two reasons.",
        "First, parallelism exists in many aspects of language, and it happens at arbitrary levels of struc",
        "ture rather than just syntactically.",
        "Second, at any given level, the problem of recognition of parallelism has plagued computational models of language since such models were first suggested.",
        "For example, parsing of English sentences containing conjunction is as yet an unsolved problem.",
        "Methods tried, such as those of Woods 1973 in LUNAR, fail because of over-generalization.",
        "Proper computational recognition of parallelism is still beyond the state of the art.",
        "The fact that interpretation of parallelism has failed for other aspects of computational models of language only indicates that the problem is a deep one.",
        "The example below is especially surprising because it demonstrates the use of parallel constructions that may be found between whole paragraphs in a discourse.",
        "The interpretation of \"the schedule,\" used anaphorically in D15-7, is not ambiguous between \"SOL,\" which is a kind of schedule, and the transmission schedule; readers recognize that the anaphor is unambiguous presumably because the process described in lines 5-7 parallels the one in lines 2-4.",
        "Whatever the proper account of parallelism for pronominal anaphora, it must also be generalizable to account for this kind of example.18 D15-1 The SOL is searched for an entry for the subscriber.",
        "2 If one is found, the subscriber's relative transmission time is computed according to formula-1.",
        "3 The subscriber's clock transmission time is computed according to formula-2.",
        "4 When the transmission time has been computed, it is inserted as the primary entry in a transmission schedule.",

        "7 The RATS transmission times are entered into the schedule.",
        "One possible consequence of these observations could be that the focus mechanism should be abandoned in favor of some as yet unspecified mechanism that is able to determine parallel relations among sets of sentences in a discourse.",
        "However, methods for interpreting pronouns from parallel sentences and paragraphs offer no constructive way of interpreting the pronouns in most of the examples presented in this paper.",

        "Intelligence, p. 394. mon subject-verb-object pattern typical of English sentences.",
        "Since what is being talked about appears in many constituent positions in sentences of a discourse, the S-V-O pattern is too gross a level to specify similarity.",
        "Hence, while parallelism is needed to deal with a certain set of cases for which the pi-rules predict incorrectly, the pi-rules are effective for many other cases of co-specification where parallelism would not be helpful.",
        "One may conclude that focus mechanisms account for one aspect of pragmatic anaphora, and that some different mechanism is needed to encode similarities in structure that sometimes occur in discourse.",
        "This paper does not give an account of such a mechanism.",
        "Rather, the examples above provide some additional observations about the nature of parallelism in interpreting pronouns in natural languages."

        "Two claims have been substantiated in this paper.",
        "First, I have shown that focusing is compatible with linguistic rules for disjoint reference, semantic selectional restrictions, and with representations delimiting quantifier scope.",
        "Furthermore, these sources of information are necessary for the pronoun interpretation rules.",
        "Second, I have demonstrated that, focusing helps control the inference process needed to interpret pronouns.",
        "The pronoun interpreter predicts a co-specifier and then asks the inference machine for confirmation; when the machine finds a contradiction rather than consistency, the focusing process produces a new candidate co-specifier.",
        "In effect, the focusing process and the inference machine collaborate on pronoun interpretation.",
        "In previous AI natural language systems, interpretation resulted from binding of free variables when making inference; the inference process could be characterized as one of proving a consequent from a set of premises.",
        "However, because the consequent of an inference rule contained free variables, many inferences had to be drawn and then \"undone\" during the search for a complete chain of inferences.",
        "The focusing approach eliminates this kind of blind binding and unbinding as well as shortens the inference chain search.",
        "A part of this paper has described and illustrated how the pronoun interpretation rules predict the co-specifiers of pronouns with both the actor and the discourse focus, and indicated that both actor and discourse foci are necessary.",
        "The rules show how many constraints – syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic19 – affect the choice of specification for pronouns; they also show how many kinds of information",
        "about the world of the speaker and hearer play a part in distinguishing the co-specifications of pronouns.",
        "By means of the discourse and actor foci, the pi-rules differentially apply the constraints; the predictions which result are tested in the database representation of the speaker and hearer's world.",
        "Focusing captures the effects of foregrounding (cf. Chafe 1975) since focusing accounts for the co-specifications of pronouns by means of the foci, and focus movement indicates how new entities may be foregrounded and pronominalized.",
        "In this paper I have demonstrated the types of anaphoric uses that cannot be explained by the focusing theory.",
        "These uses, the focus \"popping\" cases described by Grosz, and the parallelism cases, illustrate that in anaphor interpretation, other kinds of processes that are computationally realizable and controllable are needed.",
        "Furthermore, an adequate syntactic theory of forward co-specifiers, which remains to be discovered, must be incorporated in the syntactic criteria for the pronoun interpretation rules.",
        "This paper further specifies the nature of focusing as it relates to a theory of pronoun interpretation.",
        "A focus-based theory with stipulations for syntax, semantics and inferential knowledge, provides a predictive and explanatory theory of pronoun interpretation.",
        "The theory is predictive because it stipulates legal and illegal pronoun uses as well as their interpretations; the limits of its predictive power have been demonstrated as well.",
        "The theory is explanatory because several observations about anaphora in English, all crucial to focusing theory, can account for each of the rules: that pronouns are signals of what is being discussed, that whenever the discussion changes, pronouns must signal the new element of discussion without confusion, and that hearers make use of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic knowledge in a controlled way in understanding anaphors.",
        "A theory of anaphor interpretation different from the focusing theory needs either to use these observations in an account of the facts or to demonstrate why these observations are not relevant to the interpretation process."
