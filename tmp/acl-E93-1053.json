        "Government-Binding Parsing has become attractive in the last few years.",
        "A variety of systems have been designed in view of a correspondence as direct as possible with linguistic theory ([Johnson, 1989], [Pollard and Sag, 1991], [Kroch, 1989]).",
        "These approaches can be classified by their method of handling global constraints.",
        "Global constraints are syntactic in nature: They cover more than one projection.",
        "In contrast, local constraints can be checked inside a projection and, thus, lend themselves to a treatment in the lexicon.",
        "Conditions on features have been the subject of intensive study and viable logics have been proposed for them (see e.g. the CUF formalism [Diirre and Eisele, 1991], [Dorna, 1992]).",
        "In this paper, we assume such a unification-based mechanism to take care of local conditions and focus on global constraints.",
        "One class of approaches to principle based parsing (see [Pollard and Sag, 1991] for HPSG, [Kroch, 19891 for TAG) attempts to reduce global conditions to local constraints and thus to make them accessible to treatment in a feature framework.",
        "This strategy has been pursued only at the expense of sacrificing the precise formulation of the theory and the definitory power stemming from it.",
        "The result has been a shift from the structural perspective assumed by GB theory to the object-oriented view taken by unification formalisms.",
        "The other class of approaches ([Johnson, 1989]) has allowed the full range of possible restrictions on trees and has incurred potential undecidability for its parsers.",
        "We take up a middle stance on the matter in that we propose a separate logic for global constraints and posit that global constraints only work on ancestor lines (see 7).",
        "We assume \"movement\" to be encoded by the kind of gap-threading technique familiar from HPSG, LFG.",
        "In order to integrate global constraints a \"state\" (information that serves to express barrier configurations in the part of the tree which has already been built up) is associated with each \"chain\" (information about a moved element).",
        "Following HPSG, LFG, we have in mind a rule-based parser.",
        "Thus, states are manipulated when rules are chained.",
        "We need a calculus that is able to derive global constraints working on a local basis.",
        "We begin by developing this calculus hand in hand with an analysis of Chomsky's frame1 wish to thank Robin Cooper, Mark Johnson and Esther KOnig-Baumer for comments on earlier versions of this paper.",
        "work.",
        "We then go on to show that many approaches to barriers theory and a variety of diverse phenomena can be moulded into our format and conclude with an indication of ways to use the system on-line during parsing."
