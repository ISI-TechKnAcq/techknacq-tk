        "to decide important words in documents is a crucial issue for text classification, tf.idf is often used to decide them.",
        "Whereas, we apply the PageRank algorithm (Brin et al., 1998) for the issue, because the algorithm scores the centrality of a node in a graph, and important words should be regarded as having the centrality (Hassan et al., 2007).",
        "Besides, the algorithm can detect centrality in any kind of graph, so we can find important words for any purposes.",
        "In our study, we express the relation of word co-occurrence in the form of a graph.",
        "This is because we use latent information to classify documents, and documents with high topic coherence tend to have high PMI of words in the documents (Newman et al., 2010).",
        "So, we construct a graph from a viewpoint of text classification based on latent topics.",

        "we recompile the original documents with a collection of the extracted important sentences in order to refine the original documents for more sensitive to be classified.",

        "we use latent information estimated by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) to classify documents, and compare the results of the cases using both surface and latent information.",

        "Furthermore, deciding important words with PageRank scores is better than that with tf.idf in terms of clustering accuracy.",
        "Compared to the number of the extracted words in important sentences between PageRank scores and tf.idf, we see that the number of sentences extracted based on PageRank scores is smaller than that based on tf.idf, therefore, it can be thought that more context-sensitive sentences are extracted by adopting PageRank scores to decide important words.",
        "As future work, since clustering accuracy will be changed by how many sentences are compiled in a refined document set, therefore, we will consider a more sophisticated way of selecting proper important sentences.",
        "Or, to avoid the problem of selecting sentences, we will also directly use the words extracted as important words for clustering.",
        "Moreover, at this moment, we use only k-means clustering algorithm, so we will adopt our proposed method to other various clustering methods to confirm the usefulness of our method."
