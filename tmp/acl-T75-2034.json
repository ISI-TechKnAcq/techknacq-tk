        "BRIDGING Herbert H. Clark Stanford University Nixon, not long before he was deposed, was quoted as saying at a news conference, \"I am not a crook.\" We all saw immediately that Nixon shouldn't have said what he said.",
        "He wanted to assure everyone that he was an honest man, but the wording he used was to deny that he was a crook.",
        "Why should he deny that?",
        "He must have believed that his audience was entertaining the possibility that he was a crook, and he was trying to disabuse them of this belief.",
        "But in so doing, he was tacitly acknowledging that people were entertaining this possibility, and this was something he had never acknowledged before in public.",
        "Here, then, was a public admission that he was in trouble, and this signaled a change in his public posture.",
        "My inferences about Nixon's utterance stopped about there, but I am sure that the knowledgeable White House press corps went on drawing further inferences.",
        "' In any event we all took this utterance a long way.",
        "This is an example Dar excellence of a basic problem for theories of understanding natural language: How do listeners draw inferences from what they hear, what direction do they take their inferences, and when do they stop?",
        "In this particular example, at least most listeners began, tacitly, 'drawing the same line of inferences, but at a certain point, the lines diverged and went on to many different stopping points.",
        "But is this description general?",
        "Could listeners go on drawing inferences AA infinitum?",
        "And ultimately, is drawing inferences as a part of comprehension a describable process, one with specifiable constraints?",
        "In this brief paper I would like to discuss a certain class of inferences in comprehension that may provide some general lessons about the problem of drawing inferences.",
        "The inferences I will discuss are ones the speaker intends the listener to draw as an integral part of the message, and so they are a rather special type.",
        "Following Grice's (1967) terminology, I will refer to them as implicatures, since they have all the characteristics of other implicatures.",
        "I will draw three lessons about these implicatures.",
        "One: Implicatures of this kind originate in an implicit contract, of quite a specific sort, that the speaker and listener have agreed upon about the way they are to converse with each other.",
        "Two: These implicatures, though conveyed by language and a necessary part of the intended message, draw on one s knowledge of natural objects and events that goes beyond one's knowledge of language itself.",
        "Three: These implicatures are not indeterminate in length, but have a well-defined stopping rule."

        "The implicatures I am concerned with are a consequence of a speaker-listener agreement Susan Haviland and I have called the Given-New Contract (Clark and Haviland, 1974, in press; Haviland and Clark, 1974).",
        "English assertions draw a distinction between two kinds of information they convey, a distinction carried by the syntax and intonation alone.",
        "The first kind of information has been called Given information, since it is conventionally required to convey information the listener already knows; and the second kind has been called New information, since it is conventionally required to convey information that the listener doesn't yet know but that the speaker would like to get across.",
        "The point is, the Given-New distinction is a syntactic one, identifiable for sentences in isolation, and yet it serves a pragmatic function, that of conveying two types of information as far as the listener is concerned.",
        "For this distinction to be useful as a communcative device, therefore, the speaker and listener must agree to use it in the conventional way.",
        "The speaker must agree to try to construct his utterances so that the Given information contains information he believes the listener already knows and so that the New information contains information he believes the listener doesn't yet know.",
        "The listener, for his part, agrees to interpret each utterance on the assumption that the speaker is trying to do this.",
        "Consider the sentence It was Mary who left.",
        "Syntactically, it is Given that someone left, that is, X left, and it is New that that someone was Mary, that is, X = Marv.",
        "To deal with this sentence, the listener is assumed to use the following strategy.",
        "(1) He identifies the Given and the New.",
        "(2) He realizes he is expected to know already about a unique event of someone leaving, and so he searches back in memory for just such an event.",
        "When he finds it, say Ell left (\"some entity labeled E31 left\"), he calls this the Antecedent.",
        "(3) Since the listener assumes that X left was meant to refer to the Antecedent Eal left, he then replaces X in X = Mary by Ell to form the new proposition 01 = Marv.",
        "This he places in memory as what the speaker meant to assert in his utterance.",
        "In the simplest case, the strategy just given will work without problems.",
        "Consider sequence 1: 1.",
        "John saw someone leave the party early.",
        "It was Mary who left.",
        "To simplify things, imagine that the listener hearing the second sentence has in episodic memory only the information conveyed by the first.",
        "In applying his strategy to the second sentence, the listener will search for an Antecedent for X left, find an event of someone leaving in memory from the first sentence, and then integrate the New information into memory as he should.",
        "In the more typical case, however, the istener will fail at Step 2 of the strategy -- he won't find such an Antecedent directly in memory.",
        "When this happens, he is forced",
        "construct an Antecedent, by a series of nferences, from something he already knows.",

        "He might note let it would follow that one person in the â€¢oup would be missing if that person had ?ft.",
        "It must be that the speaker was ?ferring to that person by the Given (formation X left and that the listener was apposed to figure this out by drawing this Iference.",
        "In short, the listener assumes le speaker meant to convey two things: (1) le implicature The one person was missing ?cause that person, left, and (2) the latter Lause contains the intended Antecedent of le Given information in the second sentence left.",
        "In its most general form, then, the Lven-New Contract goes something like this: Given-New Contract: The speaker agrees to try to construct the Given and New information of each utterance in context (a) so that the listener is able to compute from memory the unique Antecedent that was intended for the Given information, and (b).",
        "so that he will not already have the New information attached to the Antecedent.",
        "le listener in turn knows, then, that the beaker expects him to have the knowledge ld mental wherewithal to compute the ntended Antecedent in that context, and so Dr him it becomes a matter of solving a -'oblem.",
        "What bridge can he construct (1) '1st the speaker could plausibly have xpected him to be able to construct and (2) nat the speaker could plausibly have ntended?",
        "The first part makes the listener ssess principally what facts he knows and he second what implicatures he could Lausibly draw.",
        "Bridging -- the construction of these nplicatures -- is an obligatory part of the rocess of comprehension.",
        "The listener skes it as a necessary part of nderstanding an utterance in context that e be able to identify the intended eferents (in memory) for all referring xpressions.",
        "All referring expressions are iven information, and so the listener feels t necessary to succeed in applying the trategy outlined above, since it identifies he intended referents.",
        "In most instances, he success of this strategy requires the istener to bridge, to construct certain mplicatures, and so he takes these nplicatures too as a necessary part of omprehension.",

        "John did something because he fell; that something is the Antecedent to what hft All.",
        "The sequences in 33 and 34 have similar implicatures, ones that also depend on the Antecedent's being taken as the consequence of the event mentioned in the first",
        "For 33 the implicature is approximately this (see Lakoff, 1971): 33'.",
        "All Republicans are slightly daft; therefore, John is slightly daft, which is the Antecedent to the Given information someone other than Mary is slightly daft.",
        "In all three of these sequences, the listener is expected to draw the implicature that being in one state, or doing one event, necessarily entails the concurrence of another state, or event.",
        "These are four general ways, then, in which the listener can bridge from an event or state mentioned in the first sentence to an Antecedent in the second.",
        "These bridging relations turn out to be very common!",
        "especially in narratives.",

        "One could, if one had the time and inclination, build an infinitely long bridge, or sequence of assumptions, to link one event to the Antecedent of the next.",
        "In 35, for example, we assumed that every time Alex goes to a party he gets drunk.",
        "But we could have assumed instead that every time he goes to a party he meets women, and .1'11 women speak in high voices, and high voices always remind him of his mother, and thinking about hhs mother always makes him angry, and whenever he gets angry, he gets drunk, It takes very little imagination to add span after span to a bridge of this type.",
        "Yet in a natural discourse, bridges are always determinate.",
        "Indeed, I suggest that they have a stopping rule that goes something like this: Build the shortest possible bridge that is consistent with the Given-New Contract.",
        "The listener assumes, based on this contract, that the speaker intended him to be able to compute a unique bridge from his previous knowledge to the intended antecedent of the present Given information.",
        "If the speaker was certain that the listener could do this, he must have intended the listener to take the shortest possible bridge consistent with previous knowledge, for that would make the bridge unique, as required.",
        "So in 35 the listener assumes the speaker intended him to infer no more than that every time Alex goes to a party he gets drunk, for this implicature makes the fewest assumptions yet is consistent with previous knowledge of parties, dringking, and even Alex.",
        "In short, the listener takes as the intended implicature the one that requires the fewest assumptions, yet whose assmptions are all plausible given the listener's knowledge of the speaker, the situation, and facts about the world.",
        "The implicatures I have discussed here differ from the inferences we drew from Nixon's \"I am not a crook\" in one important way.",
        "The implicatures Iâ€¢ took up were intended by the speaker to be constructed by the listener, whereas the inferences from Nixon's blunder were not.",
        "With the implicatures, as with every other intended meaning, the speaker had a unique bridge in mind, and so the listener had something unique to try to figure out.",
        "But for Nixon's bobble, after the first unique and legitimate inference -- denials presuppose that the audience does or could believe what is being denied -- the inferences were completely unauthorized by the speaker.",
        "So bridging is determinate with a definite stopping rule, whereas Unauthorized inferences typically are not.",
        "This brings us, finally, to the issue of forward vs. backward inferences.",
        "When we hear the phrase the room in 19, we may begin imagining all sorts of things about this room, some necessary, but many others optional.",
        "All but the necessary inferences here, of course, are unauthorized.",
        "These \"forward\" inferences differ radically from the \"backward\" inferences forced by the phrase t chandelier in 19, for the speaker intended the listener to infer that the room had a chandelier.",
        "Both types of inferences occur, I'm sure, but only the latter type are fully determinate.",
        "I suggest that we might do well to study the determinate inferences first, for'they may well give us a clue as to what sorts of unauthorized inferences would be likely to be drawn for the typical utterance."
