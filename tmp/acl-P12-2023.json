        "The performance of a statistical machine translation (SMT) system on a translation task depends largely on the suitability of the available parallel training data.",
        "Domains (e.g., newswire vs. blogs) may vary widely in their lexical choices and stylistic preferences, and what may be preferable in a general setting, or in one domain, is not necessarily preferable in another domain.",
        "Indeed, sometimes the domain can change the meaning of a phrase entirely.",
        "In a food related context, the Chinese sentence ?????",
        "?",
        "(?fe?nsi?",
        "he?nduo??)",
        "would mean ?They have a lot of vermicelli?",
        "; however, in an informal Internet conversation, this sentence would mean ?They have a lot of fans?.",
        "Without the broader context, it is impossible to determine the correct translation in otherwise identical sentences.",
        "This problem has led to a substantial amount of recent work in trying to bias, or adapt, the translation model (TM) toward particular domains of interest (Axelrod et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2010; Snover et al., 2008).1 The intuition behind TM adaptation is to increase the likelihood of selecting relevant phrases for translation.",
        "Matsoukas et al. (2009) introduced assigning a pair of binary features to each training sentence, indicating sentences?",
        "genre and collection as a way to capture domains.",
        "They then learn a mapping from these features to sentence weights, use the sentence weights to bias the model probability estimates and subsequently learn the model weights.",
        "As sentence weights were found to be most beneficial for lexical weighting, Chiang et al. (2011) extends the same notion of conditioning on provenance (i.e., the origin of the text) by removing the separate mapping step, directly optimizing the weight of the genre and collection features by computing a separate word translation table for each feature, estimated from only those sentences that comprise that genre or collection.",
        "The common thread throughout prior work is the concept of a domain.",
        "A domain is typically a hard constraint that is externally imposed and hand la-beled, such as genre or corpus collection.",
        "For example, a sentence either comes from newswire, or weblog, but not both.",
        "However, this poses several problems.",
        "First, since a sentence contributes its counts only to the translation table for the source it came from, many word pairs will be unobserved for a given table.",
        "This sparsity requires smoothing.",
        "Second, we may not know the (sub)corpora our training 1Language model adaptation is also prevalent but is not the focus of this work.",
        "data come from; and even if we do, ?subcorpus?",
        "may not be the most useful notion of domain for better translations.",
        "We take a finer-grained, flexible, unsupervised approach for lexical weighting by domain.",
        "We induce unsupervised domains from large corpora, and we incorporate soft, probabilistic domain membership into a translation model.",
        "Unsupervised modeling of the training data produces naturally occurring subcorpora, generalizing beyond corpus and genre.",
        "Depending on the model used to select subcorpora, we can bias our translation toward any arbitrary distinction.",
        "This reduces the problem to identifying what automatically defined subsets of the training corpus may be beneficial for translation.",
        "In this work, we consider the underlying latent topics of the documents (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Topic modeling has received some use in SMT, for instance Bilingual LSA adaptation (Tam et al., 2007), and the BiTAM model (Zhao and Xing, 2006), which uses a bilingual topic model for learning alignment.",
        "In our case, by building a topic distribution for the source side of the training data, we abstract the notion of domain to include automatically derived subcorpora with probabilistic membership.",
        "This topic model infers the topic distribution of a test set and biases sentence translations to appropriate topics.",
        "We accomplish this by introducing topic dependent lexical probabilities directly as features in the translation model, and interpolating them log-linearly with our other features, thus allowing us to discriminatively optimize their weights on an arbitrary objective function.",
        "Incorporating these features into our hierarchical phrase-based translation system significantly improved translation performance, by up to 1 BLEU and 3 TER over a strong Chinese to English baseline."

        "Lexical Weighting Lexical weighting features estimate the quality of a phrase pair by combining the lexical translation probabilities of the words in the phrase2 (Koehn et al., 2003).",

        "Chiang et al. (2011) showed that is it beneficial to condition the lexical weighting features on provenance by assigning each sentence pair a set of features, fs(e|f), one for each domain s, which compute a new word translation table ps(e|f) estimated from only those sentences which belong to s: cs(f, e)/ ?",
        "e cs(f, e) , where cs(?)",
        "is the number of occurrences of the word pair in s. Topic Modeling for MT We extend provenance to cover a set of automatically generated topics zn.",

        "di, thus enforcing topic sharing across sentence pairs in the same document instead of treating them as unrelated.",
        "Computing the topic distribution over a document and assigning it to the sentences serves to tie the sentences together in the document context.",
        "To obtain the lexical probability conditioned on topic distribution, we first compute the expected count ezn(e, f) of a word pair under topic zn:",
        "where cj(?)",
        "denotes the number of occurrences of the word pair in sentence xj , and then compute:",
        "(2) Thus, we will introduce 2?K new word translation tables, one for each pzn(e|f) and pzn(f |e), and as many new corresponding features fzn(e|f), fzn(f |e).",
        "The actual feature values we compute will depend on the topic distribution of the document we are translating.",
        "For a test document V , we infer topic assignments on V , p(zn|V ), keeping the topics found from T fixed.",
        "The feature value then becomes",
        "nation of the topic dependent lexical weight and the",
        "topic distribution of the sentence from which we are extracting the phrase.",
        "To optimize the weights of these features we combine them in our linear model with the other features when computing the model score for each phrase pair3:",
        "Combining the topic conditioned word translation table pzn(e|f) computed from the training corpus with the topic distribution p(zn|V ) of the test sentence being translated provides a probability on how relevant that translation table is to the sentence.",
        "This allows us to bias the translation toward the topic of the sentence.",
        "For example, if topic k is dominant in T , pk(e|f) may be quite large, but if p(k|V ) is very small, then we should steer away from this phrase pair and select a competing phrase pair which may have a lower probability in T , but which is more relevant to the test sentence at hand.",
        "In many cases, document delineations may not be readily available for the training corpus.",
        "Furthermore, a document may be too broad, covering too many disparate topics, to effectively bias the weights on a phrase level.",
        "For this case, we also propose a local LDA model (LTM), which treats each sentence as a separate document.",
        "While Chiang et al. (2011) has to explicitly smooth the resulting ps(e|f), since many word pairs will be unseen for a given domain s, we are already performing an implicit form of smoothing (when computing the expected counts), since each document has a distribution over all topics, and therefore we have some probability of observing each word pair in every topic.",
        "Feature Representation After obtaining the topic conditional features, there are two ways to present them to the model.",
        "They could answer the question F1: What is the probability under topic 1, topic 2, etc., or F2: What is the probability under the most probable topic, second most, etc.",
        "A model using F1 learns whether a specific topic is useful for translation, i.e., feature f1 would be",
        "model features.",
        "are learning how useful knowledge of the topic distribution is, i.e., f1 := p(argmaxzn (p(zn|V ))(e|f) ?",
        "p(argmaxzn(p(zn|V ))|V ).",
        "Using F1, if we restrict our topics to have a one-to-one mapping with genre/collection4 we see that our method fully recovers Chiang (2011).",
        "F1 is appropriate for cross-domain adaptation when we have advance knowledge that the distribution of the tuning data will match the test data, as in Chiang (2011), where they tune and test on web.",
        "In general, we may not know what our data will be, so this will overfit the tuning set.",
        "F2, however, is intuitively what we want, since we do not want to bias our system toward a specific distribution, but rather learn to utilize information from any topic distribution if it helps us create topic relevant translations.",
        "F2 is useful for dynamic adaptation, where the adapted feature weight changes based on the source sentence.",
        "Thus, F2 is the approach we use in our work, which allows us to tune our system weights toward having topic information be useful, not toward a specific distribution."
