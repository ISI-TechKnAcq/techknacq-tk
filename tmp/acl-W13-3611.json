        "For the shared task, we have addressed the following problems: noun-number, determiner and subject-verb agreement correction.",
        "For noun-number and determiner correction, we use a classification based approach to predict corrections - which is a widely used approach (Knight and Chander, 1994; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010).",
        "For subject-verb agreement correction, we propose a new rule-based approach which applies a set of conditional rules to correct the verb group to ensure its agreement with its subject.",
        "Our system obtained a score of 11.03 on the official test set using the M2 method.",
