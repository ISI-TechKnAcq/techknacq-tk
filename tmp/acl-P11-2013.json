        "Table 1 shows examples of nonstandard tokens originated from the word \"together\".",
        "We can see that some variants can be generated by dropping letters from the original word (\"tgthr\") or substituting letters with digit (\"2gether\"); however, many variants are generated by combining the letter insertion, deletion, and substitution operations (\"to-qethaa\", \"2gthr\").",

        "It consists of 303 distinct nonstandard tokens and their corresponding dictionary words.",
        "We developed our own Twitter message test set consisting of 6,150 tweets manually annotated via the Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "3 to 6 turkers were required to convert the nonstandard tokens in the tweets to the standard English words.",
        "We extract the nonstandard tokens whose most frequently normalized word consists of letters/digits/apostrophe, and is different from the token itself.",
        "This results in 3,802 distinct nonstandard tokens that we use as the test set.",
        "147 (3.87%) of them have more than one corresponding standard English words.",
        "Similar to prior work, we use isolated nonstandard tokens without any context, that is, the LM probabilities P(S) are based on unigrams.",
        "We compare our system against three approaches.",
        "The first one is a comprehensive list of chat slangs, abbreviations, and acronyms collected by Internet-Slang.com; it contains normalized word forms for 6,105 commonly used slangs.",
        "The second is the word-abbreviation lookup table generated by the supervised deletion-based abbreviation approach proposed in (Pennell and Liu, 2010).",
        "It contains 477,941 (word, abbreviation) pairs automatically generated for 54,594 CMU dictionary words.",
        "The third is the jazzy spell checker based on the Aspell algorithm (Idzelis, 2005).",
        "It integrates the phonetic matching algorithm (DoubleMetaphone) and Leven-shtein distance that enables the interchanging of two adjacent letters, and changing/deleting/adding of letters.",
        "The system performance is measured using the n-best accuracy (n=1,3).",
        "For each nonstandard token, the system is considered correct if any of the corresponding standard words is among the n-best output from the system.",
        "Results of system accuracies are shown in Table 3.",
        "For the system \"LetterTran (All)\", we first generate a lookup table by applying the trained CRF model to the CMU dictionary to generate up to 30 variants for each dictionary word.",
        "To make the comparison more meaningful, we also trim our lookup table to the same size as the deletion table, namely \"LetterTran (Trim)\".",
        "The trimming was performed by selecting the most frequent dictionary words and their generated variants until the length limit is reached.",
        "Word frequency information was obtained from the entire Edinburgh corpus.",
        "For both the deletion and letter transformation lookup tables, we generate a ranked list of candidate words for each nonstandard token, by sorting the combined score p(Ti\\Si) x C(Si), where p(Ti\\Si) is the model confidence and C(Si) is the unigram count generated from the Edinburgh corpus (we used counts instead of unigram probability P(Si)).",
        "Since the string similarity and letter switching algorithms implemented in jazzy can compensate the letter transformation model, we also investigate combining it with our approach, \"LetterTran(All) + Jazzy\".",
        "In this configuration, we combine the candidate words from both systems and rerank them according to the unigram frequency; since the \"LetterTran\" itself is very effective in ranking candidate words, we only use the jazzy output for tokens where \"LetterTran\" is not very confident about its best candidate ((p(Ti \\ Si) x C(Si) is less than a threshold 6 = 100).",
        "We notice the accuracy using the InternetSlang list is very poor, indicating text message normalization is a very challenging task that can hardly be tackled by using a hand-crafted list.",
        "The deletion table has modest performance given the fact that it covers only deletion-based abbreviations and letter repetitions (see Section 2.1).",
        "The \"LetterTran\" approach significantly outperforms all baselines even after trimming.",
        "This is because it handles different ways of forming nonstandard tokens in an unified framework.",
        "Taking the Twitter test set for an example, the lookup table generated by \"LetterTran\" covered 69.94% of the total test tokens, and among them, 96% were correctly normalized in the 3-best output, resulting in 67.02% overall accuracy.",
        "The test tokens that were not covered by the \"LetterTrans\" model include those generated by accidentally switching and inserting letters (e.g., \"absolotuely\" for \"absolutely\") and slangs (\"addy\" or \"address\").",
        "Adding the output from jazzy compensates these problems and boosts the 1-best accuracy, achieving 21.69% and 18.16% absolute performance gain respectively on the Twitter and SMS test sets, as compared to using jazzy only.",
        "We also observe that the \"LetterTran\" model can be easily ported to the SMS domain.",
        "When combined with the jazzy module, it achieved 62.05% 1-best accuracy, outperforming the domain-specific supervised the pre-categorized approach by (Cook and Stevenson, 2009) (59.4%).",
        "Regarding different feature categories, we found the character-level features are strong indicators, and using phonetic-and syllabic-level features also slightly benefits the performance."
