        "In this paper, we argue that comparable collections of historical written resources can help overcoming typical challenges posed by heritage texts enhancing spelling normalization, POS-tagging and subsequent diachronic linguistic analyses.",
        "Thus, we present a comparable corpus of historical German recipes and show how such a comparable text collection together with the application of innovative MT inspired strategies allow us (i) to address the word form normalization problem and (ii) to automatically generate a diachronic dictionary of spelling variants.",
        "Such a diachronic dictionary can be used both for spelling normalization and for extracting new ?translation?",
        "(word formation/change) rules for diachronic spelling variants.",
        "Moreover, our approach can be applied virtually to any diachronic collection of texts regardless of the time span they represent.",

        "The study of heritage documents has been one of the regular sources of knowledge in the Humanities, specially in history-related disciplines.",
        "The last years have witnessed an increased interest in approaches combining NLP and corpus-based techniques in the Humanities (Piotrowski, 2012) as they can provide new insights and/or a more consistent and reliable account of findings.",
        "Until recently, research efforts have been focused on building diachronic corpora (e.g. Old Bailey Online project (Hitchcock et al., 2012) and its follow-up, the Old Bailey Corpus (Huber, 2007), the Bonn Corpus of Early New High German (Diel et al., 2002) or the GerManC (Scheible et al., 2011b) for German and many others).",
        "Such resources are generally annotated with shallow metadata (e.g. year of publication, author, geographical location) for allowing fast retrieval.",
        "However, the annotation of richer linguistic and semantic information still poses a series of challenges that have to be overcome, such as (i) the noise introduced by deviant linguistic data (spelling/orthography variation, lack of sentence boundaries, etc.)",
        "typical of this kind of material, due to the lack of standardized writing conventions in terms of words and punctuation and hence (ii) the higher error rates obtained when applying standard NLP methods.",
        "Further, standardization of spelling variation in historical texts can be broken down at least into",
        "two subproblems: 1. the old word forms often differ from the mod",
        "ern orthography of the same items.",
        "Consider, for instance, the diachronic variants of the third person singular of present tense of the verb werden in German (which means ?become?",
        "as full verb, or is used as auxiliary verb to build the future): wirt, wirdt, wirdet vs wird; (Piotrowski, 2012) and 2. the denomination of certain objects may result completely different from that used in the modern language due to historical reasons (e.g. adoption of foreign language terms, semantic shift).",
        "Consider, as an example, the German historical/modern variants of the word lemon (e.g. Limonie/Zitrone) or of the word woman (e.g. Weib/Frau).",
        "Previous approaches to spelling normalization of historical texts have focused on the first sub-problem.",
        "Two main strategies that have been applied: ?",
        "a rule based strategy, in which the translation of historical variants into modern forms",
        "is performed on the ground of manually written or semi-automatically gathered rules (cf. (Pilz et al., 2008), (Bollmann et al., 2011)); ?",
        "a string similarity strategy, in which a semi-automatic attempt is made to link historical variants with modern dictionary entries following string similarity (cf. (Giusti et al., 2007), (Kunstmann and Stein, 2007), (Dipper, 2010), (Hendrickx and Marquilhas, 2011), (Gotscharek et al., 2011)) or phonetic conflation strategies (cf. (Koolen et al., 2006), (Jurish, 2008) ).",
        "These approaches have the disadvantage of ending up relying on a time-specific dictionary of variants, e.g. they can cope with variants realized in texts stemming from the same period of time for which they have been created but may result inappropriate for texts belonging to other time spans.",
        "Moreover, to our knowledge, there is currently no approach to spelling normalization that can address successfully the second subproblem stated above ?",
        "the recognition of paraphrastic variations realized as completely different strings or consisting of semantic shifts.",
        "As it has been often noted, the problem of standardizing diachronic variants can be understood as a translation operation, where instead of translating between two different languages, translation takes place between two diachronic varieties of the same language.",
        "Inspired by experiments done for interlinguistic translation (Rapp et al., 2012), the idea is to use diachronic comparable corpora to automatically produce a dictionary of diachronic spelling variants even including semantic shifts, regardless of the historical variants at stake.",
        "In short, we first build a comparable historical corpus made up of recipe repertoires published in the German language during the Early Modern Age along with a contemporary comparable corpus.",
        "Second, we address the problem of recognizing and translating different variants by relaying on MT techniques based on string similarity as well as on semantic similarity measures.",
        "Finally, we automatically extract a diachronic dictionary of spelling and semantic variants which also provides a canonical form.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the comparable corpus of German recipes.",
        "Section 3 describes the approach used for generating the dictionary of diachronic spelling variants.",
        "Section 4 shows the results of a preliminary evaluation.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we conclude by discussing some final remarks."
