        "Certain utterance structures contain linguistic clues that constrain their interpretation on an argumentative basis.",
        "The following example illustrates these constraints: I was robbed yesterday...",
        "(1) ...but luckily I had little money.",
        "(2) ...but luckily I had a little money.",
        "(3) ...but unfortunately I had little money.",
        "(4) ...but unfortunately I had a little money.",
        "We describe and compute the signification of such sentences by specifying how the key words (in italics) constrain the argumentative power of the terminal sub-sentences (TSS) \"I was robbed yesterday\" and \"I had money\".",
        "They may all be interpreted in a relevant context, but hints for recognizing the need of an \"odd\" context are given.",
        "For instance, in (1) and (2), the robbery is considered bad because of the opposition introduced by \"but\", to something considered happy because of \"luckily\".",
        "Holding money is considered good in (2) and bad in (1) because of the general structure of the sentence and the opposition between \"little\" and \"a little\".",
        "In (3) and (4), the robbery is considered good, while in (3) money is normally considered good too, and in (4) (the oddest) it is considered bad (imagine a speaker who",
        "usually likes to be robbed just to see the disappointment because he holds no money).",
        "We see on these examples that TSS's are argumentatively ambiguous and modifiers constrain them.",
        "In this paper we propose, for a given utterance, the construction of the signification of the underlying sentence, which captures its polyphonic and argumentative aspects.",
        "The signification of a sentence is viewed as the application of an argumentative superstructure to the signification of TSS's, free of operators or connectives.",
        "The signification must finally be interpreted in the context of the utterance."

        "Our model rests on a framework inspired by Ducrot (1980).",
        "He defines an utterance as a concrete occurrence of an abstract entity called a sentence.",
        "Understanding an utterance means computing its meaning, which may be formalized in different contexts (such as speech acts or beliefs).",
        "The meaning is built from the context and from the signification of the sentence which iescribes all potential uses of the linguistic matter.",
        "Ducrot's integrated pragmatics also claims that many phenomena usually described at the pragmatic level, must be described in the signification (such as argumentation).",
        "Within Ducrot's framework, we use his theory of polyphony, topoi and modifiers.",
        "Polyphony is a theory that models utterances with three levels of characters.",
        "The talking subject refers to the person who pronounced the words.",
        "The talking subject introduces the speaker to whom the words are attributed (different from the talking subject in some cases such as indirect speech).",
        "Sentences contain literal semantic contents, each one being under the responsibility of an utterer.",
        "The relation between the speaker of a sentence and the utterer of a content defines the commitment of the speaker to such a semantic content.",
        "This commitment takes one of the following values: identification (ID), opposition (oPP) and partial commitment (Pc) (Ducrot, 1984; Grandchamp, 1994).",
        "Sentences are chained under linguistic warrants",
        "called topoi (plural of topos).",
        "Topoi are found in words.",
        "In a sentence or a combination of sentences, some topoi are selected, others are not relevant to the discourse context.",
        "In the interpretative process, still others will be eliminated because of irrelevance to the situation.",
        "A topos is selected under one of its topical forms, made up of a direction (positive or negative) and other parameters.",
        "The topical form is selected with a given strength.",
        "For instance, there is a topos T linking wealth to acquisitions.",
        "The word \"rich\" may be seen as the positive form of T that says \"when you are rich you may buy a lot of things\".",
        "The word \"poor\" contains the negative form of the same topos T, that is \"when you are not rich you may not buy a lot of things\".",
        "Unlike the warrants of Tou1min (1958), topoi are not logic warrants.",
        "They may give some support for inferences, but do not have to.",
        "The strength is ruled by a subclass of operators called modifiers, whose semantics is described precisely as modifying the strength of a selected topos.",
        "Such words include \"very\", \"little\" or \"a little\".",
        "Modifiers combine with each other and with argument sentences.",
        "The strength is specified by a lexical-based partial ordering, producing non-quantitative degrees similar to Klein's (1982) ."
