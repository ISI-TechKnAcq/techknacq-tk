        "Much recent work in lexical semantics has been concerned with accounting for regular polysemy, i.e., the regular and predictable sense alternations certain classes of words are subject to.",
        "Adjectives, more than other categories, are a striking example of regular polysemy since they are able to take on different meanings depending on their context, viz., the noun or noun class they modify (see Pustejovsky (1995) and the references therein).",
        "The adjective fast in (1) receives different interpretations when modifying the nouns programmer, plane and scientist.",
        "A fast programmer is typically a programmer who programs quickly, a fast plane is typically a plane that flies quickly, a fast scientist can be a scientist who publishes papers quickly, who performs experiments quickly, who observes something quickly, who reasons, thinks, or runs quickly.",
        "Interestingly, adjectives like fast are ambiguous across and within the nouns they modify.",
        "A fast plane is not only a plane that flies quickly, but also a plane that lands, takes off, turns, or travels quickly.",
        "Even the more restrictive fast programmer allows more than one interpretation.",
        "One can easily think of a context where a fast programmer thinks, runs or talks quickly.",
        "(1) a. fast programmer b. fast plane c.fast scientist *The work reported in this paper was carried out while the author was at the Division of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.",
        "(2) a. easy problem b. difficult language c. good cook d. good soup",
        "Adjectives like fast have been extensively studied in the lexical semantics literature and their properties have been known at least since Vendler (1968).",
        "The meaning of adjective-noun combinations like those in (1) and (2) are usually paraphrased with a verb modified by the adjective in question or its corresponding adverb.",
        "For example, an easy problem is a problem that is easy to solve or a problem that one can solve easily.",
        "In order to account for the meaning of these combinations Vendler (1968, 92) points out that in most cases not one verb, but a family of verbs is needed.",
        "Vendler further observes that the noun figuring in an adjective-noun combination is usually the subject or object of the paraphrasing verb.",
        "Although fast usually triggers a verb-subject interpretation (see (1)), easy and difficult trigger verb-object interpretations (see (2a,b)).",
        "An easy problem is usually a problem that is easy to solve, whereas a difficult language is a language that is difficult to learn, speak, or write.",
        "Adjectives like good allow either verb-subject or verb-object interpretations: a good cook is a cook who cooks well whereas good soup is soup that tastes good or soup that is good to eat.",
        "Pustejovsky (1995) avoids enumerating the various senses for adjectives like fast by exploiting the semantics of the nouns they modify.",
        "Pustejovsky treats nouns as having a qualia structure as part of their lexical entries, which among other things, specifies possible events associated with the entity.",
        "For example, the telic (purpose) role of the qualia structure for problem has a value equivalent to solve.",
        "When the adjective easy is combined with problem, it predicates over the telic role of problem and consequently the adjective-noun combination receives the interpretation a problem that is easy to solve.",
        "Pustejovsky (1995) does not give an exhaustive list of the telic roles a given noun may have.",
        "Furthermore, in cases where more than one interpretations are provided (see Vendler (1968)), no information is given with respect to the likelihood of these interpretations.",
        "Out-of context, the number of interpretations for fast scientist is virtually unlimited, yet some interpretations are more likely than others: fast scientist is more likely to be a scientist who performs experiments quickly or who publishes quickly than a scientist who draws or drinks quickly.",
        "In this paper we focus on polysemous adjective-noun combinations (see (1) and (2)) and attempt to address the following questions: (a) Can the meanings of these adjective-noun combinations be acquired automatically from corpora?",
        "(b) Can we constrain the number of interpretations by providing a ranking on the set of possible meanings?",
        "(c) Can we determine if an adjective has a preference for a verb-subject or verb-object interpretation?",
        "We provide a probabilistic model which combines distributional information about how likely it is for any verb to be modified by the adjective in the adjective-noun combination or its corresponding adverb with information about how likely it is for any verb to take the modified noun as its object or subject.",
        "We obtain quantitative information about verb-adjective modification and verb-argument relations from the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources designed to represent current British English (Burnard, 1995).",
        "We evaluate our results by comparing the models predictions against human judgments and show that the models ranking of meanings correlates reliably with human intuitions."

        "This can be expressed as the joint probability P(a, n, v, rel) where v is the verbal predicate modified by the adverb a (derived from the adjective present in the adjective-noun combination) bearing the argument relation rel (i.e., subject or object) to the head noun n.

        "Another hypothesis (which we test below) is that most adjectives included in the experimental stimuli have an object-bias, and therefore subject-related interpretations are generally less preferred than object-related ones.",
        "An important question is how well humans agree in their paraphrase judgments for adjective-noun combinations.",
        "Inter-subject agreement gives an upper bound for the task and allows us to interpret how well the model is doing in relation to humans.",
        "For each subject group we performed correlations on the elicited judgments using leave-one-out resampling (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991).",
        "For the first group, the average inter-subject agreement was .67 (Min = .03, Max = .82, SD = .14), and for the second group .65 (Min = .05, Max = .82, SD = .14).",
        "This means that our model performs satisfactorily given that humans do not perfectly agree in their judgments.",
        "The elicited judgments can be further used to derive",
        "argument preferences for polysemous adjectives the grammatical function preferences (i.e., subject or object) for a given adjective.",
        "In particular, we can determine which is the preferred interpretation for individual adjectives and compare these preferences against the ones produced by our model.",
        "Argument preferences can be easily derived from the models output by comparing subject-related and object-related paraphrases.",
        "For each adjective we gathered the subject and object-related interpretations derived by the model and performed an ANOVA in order to determine the significance of the Grammatical Function effect.",
        "We interpret a significant effect as bias towards a particular grammatical function.",
        "We classify an adjective as object-biased if the mean of the judgments for the object interpretation of this particular adjective is larger than the mean for the subject interpretation; subject-biased adjectives are classified accordingly, whereas adjectives for which no effect of Grammatical Function is found are classified as equi-biased.",
        "Table 6 shows the biases for the nine adjectives as derived by our model.",
        "The presence of the symbol V/ indicates significance of the Grammatical Function effect as well as the direction of the bias.",
        "Argument preferences were elicited from human subjects in a similar fashion.",
        "For each adjective we gathered the elicited responses pertaining to subject and object-related interpretations and performed an ANOVA.",
        "The biases and the significance of the Grammatical Function effect () are shown in Table 6.",
        "Comparison of the biases derived from the model with ones derived from the elicited judgments shows that the model and the humans are in agreement for all adjectives but slow, wrong and safe.",
        "On the basis of human judgments slow has a subject bias, whereas wrong has an object bias.",
        "Although the model could not reproduce this result there is a tendency in the right direction (see Table 6).",
        "Note that in our correlation analysis reported above the elicited judgments were compared against model-derived paraphrases without taking argument preferences into account.",
        "We would expect a correct model to produce intuitive meanings at least for the interpretation a given adjective favors.",
        "We further examined the models behavior by performing separate correlation analyses for preferred and dispreferred biases as determined previously by the ANOVAs conducted for each adjective.",
        "Since the adjective good was equi-biased we included both biases (i.e., object-related and subject-related) in both correlation analyses.",
        "The comparison between our model and the human judgments yielded a Pearson correlation coefficient of .52 (p < .01, N = 150) for the preferred interpretations and a correlation of .23 (p < .01, N = 150) for the dispreferred interpretations.",
        "The result indicates that our model is particularly good at deriving meanings corresponding to the argument-bias for a given adjective.",
        "However, the dispreferred interpretations also correlate significantly with human judgments, which suggests that the model derives plausible interpretations even in cases where the default argument bias is overridden."

      "text": [
        "In this paper we showed how adjectival meanings can be acquired from a large corpus and provided a probabilistic model which derives a preference ordering on the set of possible interpretations.",
        "Our model does not only acquire clusters of meanings (following Vendlers (1968) insight) but furthermore can be used to obtain argument preferences for a given adjective.",
        "We rigorously evaluated the results of our model by eliciting paraphrase judgments from subjects naive to linguistic theory.",
        "Comparison between our model and human judgments yielded a reliable correlation of .40 when the upper bound for the task (i.e., inter-subject agreement) is approximately .65.",
        "Furthermore, our model performed reliably better than a naive baseline model, which only achieved a correlation of .25.",
        "Although adjective-noun polysemy is a well researched phenomenon in the theoretical linguistics literature, the experimental approach advocated here is new to our knowledge.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed model can be viewed as complementary to linguistic theory: it automatically derives a ranking of meanings, thus distinguishing likely from unlikely interpretations.",
        "Even if linguistic theory was able to enumerate all possible interpretations for a given adjective (note that in the case of polysemous adjectives we would have to take into account all nouns or noun classes the adjective could possibly modify) it has no means to indicate which ones are likely and which ones are not.",
        "Our model fares well on both tasks.",
        "It recasts the problem of adjective-noun polysemy in a probabilistic framework deriving a large number of interpretations not readily available from linguistic introspection.",
        "The information acquired from the corpus can be also used to quantify the argument preferences of a given adjective.",
        "These are only implicit in the lexical semantics literature where certain adjectives are exclusively given a verb-subject or verb-object interpretation.",
        "We have demonstrated that we can empirically derive argument biases for a given adjective that correspond to human intuitions."
