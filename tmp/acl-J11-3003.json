        "A common goal of many spoken dialog systems (SDSs) is to offer efficient and natural access to applications and services, such as e-mail, calendars, travel booking, navigation systems, and product recommendation, in situations where the user's hands and/or eyes are busy with another task, for example driving a car (Pon-Barry, Weng, and Varges 2006) or operating equipment (Hieronymus and Dowding 2007).",
        "The naturalness and usability of a spoken dialog interface depends not only on its ability to recognize and interpret user utterances correctly, but also on its ability to present information in ways that users can understand and that help them to achieve their goals.",
        "One class of SDSs that has received considerable attention from both academic research and industry are information-seeking SDSs, which are designed to enable users to browse the space of available options (e.g., flights, hotels, movies) and choose a suitable option from a potentially large set of choices.",
        "Dialogs with such systems typically consist of two main types of activity: information gathering, in which the system tries to establish users' constraints and preferences, and information presentation, in which the system typically enumerates the set of options that match the user's constraints.",
        "An example is given in Figure 1.",
        "In some systems, these activities take place in strictly sequential phases: All of the information necessary to form a database query is gathered, and then the returned options are presented, one at a time or in small groups.",
        "In other systems, the activities are interleaved, with users refining their constraints after being presented with some options, or a summary of the option space.",
        "In either case, when the number of options to be presented is large, this process can be laborious, leading to reduced user satisfaction.",
        "Moreover, as Walker et al.",
        "(2004) observe, having to access the set of available options sequentially makes it difficult for the user to remember the various aspects of multiple options and to compare them mentally.",
        "Although much research has been conducted on the information gathering phase of spoken dialog systems, relatively little attention has been devoted to information presentation.",
        "An analysis of the Communicator corpus consisting of approximately 2,000 dialogs with nine different spoken dialog systems found that information presentation is the main contributor to dialog duration (Moore 2006); see Table 1.",
        "Moreover, the DARPA Communicator evaluation showed that task duration is negatively correlated with user satisfaction (r = – 0.31, p < 0.001, see Walker, Passonneau, and Boland [2001]).",
        "Thus, there is reason to believe that improvements in information presentation will lead to improvements in spoken dialog systems.",
        "Recently, two approaches to information presentation that present an alternative to sequential information presentation have been proposed.",
        "In the user-model (UM) based approach, the system identifies a small number of options that best match the user's preferences (Moore et al.",
        "2004; Walker et al.",
        "2004).",
        "In the summarize and refine (SR) approach, the system structures the large number of options into a small number of clusters that share attributes.",
        "The system then summarizes the clusters based on their attributes, thus prompting the user to provide additional constraints (Polifroni, Chung, and Seneff 2003; Chung 2004).",

        "2004).",
        "MATCH included content planning algorithms to determine what options and attributes to mention, but used a simple template-based approach to realization.",
        "For the design of the FLIGHTS system, Moore et al.",
        "(2004) focused on organizing and expressing the descriptions of the selected options and attributes in ways that were intended to make the descriptions both easy to understand and memorable.",
        "In addition, to increase coherence and naturalness of the descriptions, the system reasons about information structure (Steedman 2000) to control intonation, uses referring expressions that highlight attributes relevant to the user (e.g., a direct flight for a user who wants to minimize connections, vs. the cheapest flight for a user concerned about price), and signals discourse relations (e.g., contrast) with appropriate intonational and discourse cues.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows a description of options tailored to a user who prefers flying business class, on direct flights, and on KLM, in that order.",
        "The FLIGHTS system presents a small number of options that best match the user's constraints, and points out ways in which those options satisfy user preferences.",

        "When there are hundreds of options to consider (e.g., when choosing among consumer products, hotels, or restaurants) there may be many options that fit the user's specification and interest.",
        "In addition, the user model may not contain enough information for new users, or users may not be able to provide constraints until they hear more information about the available options.",
        "This brings up a second problem with the UM-based approach, namely, that it does not provide the user with an overview of the option space, because options scoring below a specified threshold or below a certain rank are not mentioned.",
        "This is related to the third problem, which is the actual or perceived risk that users might miss out on options they would have chosen if they had heard about them.",
        "The last two problems may reduce user confidence in the system, if users have the perception that the system is not telling them about all of the available options, and a lack of confidence may ultimately lead to a decrease in user satisfaction.",
        "Finally, the evaluation of the FLIGHTS system focused on the effectiveness of using information structure to generate more natural sounding utterances by controlling intonation, but did not include an explicit comparison to other information presentation strategies.",

        "For large data sets, attributes that partition the data into the minimal number of clusters should be chosen, so that a concise summary can be presented to the user to refine.",
        "3 In the original implementation as reported in Polifroni, Chung, and Seneff (2003), however, the cluster attributes were specified in advance based on domain knowledge, not determined at run time based solely on the set of options returned.",

        "First, there may be long refinement paths in the dialog structure, that is, many dialog turns may be necessary to narrow in on a suitably small set of options.",
        "Because the system does not know about the user's preferences, the option clusters may contain irrelevant information which must be filtered out successively with each refinement step.",
        "In addition, the difficulty of summarizing options typically increases with their number and diversity, to the point where the summary becomes uninformative (e.g., I found flights on 9 airlines.",
        ").",
        "Second, exploration of trade-offs is difficult with the SR approach in situations where there is no optimal option.",
        "If at least one option satisfies all of the user's requirements, this option can be found efficiently with the SR strategy.",
        "However, the system does not point out trade-offs among alternatives in cases where no optimal option exists.",
        "For example, in the flight booking domain, suppose the user wants a flight that is cheap and direct, but all the flights are either expensive and direct or cheap and indirect.",
        "In the SR approach, the user will have to ask for cheap flights and direct flights separately because one of these constraints must be relaxed in each case, and thus the user has to explore these refinement paths separately.",
        "A third drawback of the SR approach is that the attribute(s) chosen for summarization may not be relevant to the user.",
        "The procedure for choosing the attributes for clustering the options is designed to select attributes that generalize well over the data (i.e., produce large clusters of options), and thus lead to efficient summarization.",
        "Hence attributes that partition the data set into a small number of clusters are preferred.",
        "If the attribute that is best for summarization is not of interest to a particular user, dialog duration is increased unnecessarily.",

        "If the database does not contain any KLM flights that also match the user's other preferences (such as preferring direct flights to connecting ones), the system can recognize this conflict and present an explicit trade-off, as in I found a KLM flight but it requires a connection in Amsterdam.",

        "We chose to include two layers in order to allow for informative trade-offs: If information from only one layer were available at a time, it would not be possible to contrast the most relevant advantages and disadvantages of alternative options, which is needed to make the trade-off(s) explicit.",

        "For example, the justification of the flights in the left branch of the tree in Figure 8 is their fare class.",
        "Therefore, they are described as flights with availability in business class.On the other hand, the justification for the indirect business class flights is that they have an arrival time that matches the user query better.",

        "If a node is justified by several attributes, only one of them is selected for reference.",

        "There are three main cases to be distinguished:",

        "The continuous values for attributes such as price and arrival-time must be summarized, as they may differ in their values even if they are in the same cluster.",

        "A sample dialog highlighting these realizations is shown in Figure 10.",
        "The turns marked \"S\" in this dialog were generated by our system, employing the business user model (see Figure 2).",

        "This can be done by either acquiring the user's preferences, or by choosing a distance function that describes the relation between values of an attribute.",
        "For the air travel domain, we used three non-relaxable constraints (i.e., constraints for which we do not use a distance function but only accept options that fully match these requirements): departure airport, arrival airport, and travel date.",
        "If our database had contained distances between airports, our system would have been able to suggest flights that start from or arrive at a nearby airport (e.g., departing from Glasgow instead of Edinburgh).",
        "Similarly, in a restaurant recommendation system with information about streets, an external resource could be used to determine which streets are in the same neighborhood, in order to cluster them according to distance or the time it takes to travel to them using a specific means of transport.",
        "To effectively summarize categorical data, it is often necessary to use an ontology, or some kind of ordering that is meaningful for the user.",
        "Consider for example our clustering of airlines: There is no information in our database that would make a KLM flight more similar to a Lufthansa flight than to a RyanAir flight based on the airline.",
        "Therefore, we use information from the user model to arrange options into clusters that are meaningful to the user by grouping together airlines that the user prefers to use, and those airlines that the user prefers not to use.",

        "We therefore designed a third experiment, in which participants were assigned flight booking tasks and directly interacted with the dialog system (see Section 6).",
        "Because UMSR employs information from a user model and content structuring to present only those options that are likely to be relevant to the user, and explicitly points out trade-offs among options, we hypothesized that it would also consume less cognitive resources, that is, presentations based on UMSR would impose less cognitive load than those based on SR.",
        "Therefore, in parallel to our work on the interaction task experiment, a companion project conducted experiments using a dual-task setting (driving a simulated car while using the dialog system to book flights) to investigate the effects of the two strategies to information presentation (UMSR vs. SR) on cognitive load (Hu et al.",

        "Results indicated that, contrary to expectations, the cognitive load placed on users by the UMSR system was in some cases higher than the cognitive load placed on users in the SR condition, and that this affected performance on the primary task (driving).",
        "By examining logs of the conversations, we found that the UMSR approach sometimes generated turns that were considerably longer than turns produced by the SR approach.",

        "In this section, we summarize our findings from the three experiments with respect to our initially stated hypotheses.",
        "Did the UMSR Approach Increase the Efficiency of Information Presentation?",
        "Overall, both in terms of the subjectively perceived efficiency, and in terms of the objectively measurable efficiency, the UMSR system significantly outperformed the SR system.",
        "Task duration was significantly lower in the UMSR condition than in the SR condition in the interaction experiment, with the UMSR system also requiring fewer dialog turns.",
        "Furthermore, participants reported that they felt the optimal option was accessed more quickly in the UMSR condition than in the SR condition in all three experiments.",
        "Did the UMSR Approach Make Information Presentation More Effective?",
        "This hypothesis was tested in the interaction task experiment by measuring task success.",
        "We found that users chose the option that was best for the role they were playing more often in the interaction experiment.",
        "These findings also agree with results obtained in other work, using a dual-task method (Hu et al.",
        "2007; Winterboer et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Thus, we conclude that information access with the UMSR approach is more effective than with the SR approach.",

        "Questions 2 (\"Did the system give X a good overview of the available options?\")",

        "of the questionnaire were designed to assess this aspect.",
        "The first two experiments showed a clear preference for the UMSR system in comparison with the SR system.",
        "Participants in the interaction experiment also exhibited a preference for the UMSR system, but the difference in ratings did not reach significance level.",
        "The smaller effect size in the third experiment is likely due to controlling dialog length: The overview of options deemed uninteresting to the user was sometimes omitted to reduce turn length.",
        "This omission seems to negatively affect the user's overview of the option space and their confidence in having heard about all relevant options.",
        "Was the Understandability of the System Improved?",
        "Understandability was the single aspect in which the SR system was not outperformed by the UMSR system for the first two experiments (differences in ratings were marginal).",
        "Our hypothesis had been that the user model improves understandability by tailoring the presentation of the options to the user.",
        "This seemed to be outweighed by the larger amount of information presented in the original implementation of UMSR, however.",
        "In the interaction task experiment, in which dialog turn length was kept constant across the SR and UMSR conditions, turns in the two conditions contained a similar number of information units.",
        "In this case, the UMSR system achieved better understandability than the SR system.",
        "Finally, Did We Achieve Higher User Satisfaction?",
        "For all conditions, users preferred the UMSR strategy over the SR strategy, and on no aspect was the SR system found to be significantly better than the UMSR system in our experiments.",
        "We conclude that our hypotheses were largely confirmed, and that a challenge for future work lies in the development of methods that allow the system to predict and control for the cognitive load induced by system utterances.",
        "We believe that this is particularly important because dialog systems are frequently used in situations in which the user's hands and eyes are busy.",
        "For example, NASA is interested in spoken dialog technology for use in spacecraft (Rayner et al.",
        "2003), and automobile manufacturers are integrating an ever-increasing number of voice services into their products.",
        "In subsequent work, an end-to-end dialog system following the UMSR strategy was implemented in the context of the Townlnfo system (Paksima, Georgila, and Moore 2009), which allows users to search for restaurants in the city of Edinburgh.",
        "The system was evaluated with participants interacting directly with the system (as opposed to a WOZ setting), and was compared to a system that implemented the typical sequential enumeration approach to information presentation.",
        "In the UMSR condition, both perceived task completion (90.7% vs. 85.2%) and actual task completion (74.1% vs. 62.9%) were higher than in the traditional sequential enumeration condition.",
        "Furthermore, dialogs with the UMSR system required significantly fewer turns to complete the task (9.24 for UMSR and 17.78 for the sequential system), and conciseness, accessibility, and efficiency were all rated more highly in the UMSR condition than the sequential enumeration condition.",
        "In addition, overall user satisfaction was significantly higher for the UMSR system.",
        "Finally, the UMSR system outperformed the sequential system particularly clearly in cases where a trade-off among options existed."

        "That is, they differ in the way they rank attributes for presentation and the method used for clustering.",
        "There are two approaches to ranking, one based on the original refiner approach (which chooses to cluster on attributes for which a small number of clusters account for most of the options) and the other based on a user model (which chooses attributes for clustering based on the ranking in the user model).",

        "Polifroni and Walker (2008) evaluated the different versions of the refiner strategy approach in a reading experiment, similar to our first experiment.",
        "However, they evaluated only the first system turn in the dialog for the different conditions presented.",
        "The experimental conditions contrasted structuring with versus without a user model, and with versus without associative clustering.",
        "They found that users preferred the system utterances that were generated based on a user model when there were a large number of options available, and that the associative mode was beneficial when tailoring the summaries to the user.",
        "Their results hence support our approach: The version of the system that included user modeling and associative clustering led to dialogs that are the most similar to those of our UMSR approach.",
        "There remain, however, a number of differences between their refined refiner with user modeling and associative clustering and our UMSR model.",
        "First, in UMSR the user model is not only used to structure, but also to select options (via pruning of the option tree).",
        "Second, Polifroni and Walker's (2008) approach contains two clustering steps: one for clustering attribute values, which is the same as in our UMSR approach, and a second one for clustering options following each query.",
        "This second clustering step corresponds to our tree structuring step.",
        "Whereas Polifroni and Walker re-cluster at every system turn, we only build up the option tree once (unless the user changes their query, e.g., by wanting to fly on another day, or asking to fly on another airline).",
        "Finally, their notion of associative clustering (i.e., grouping together attributes whose values are connected, such as short flight duration and direct flights) is realized in our system as well, but in a less explicit way: In the tree structuring phase, attributes that have identical values for a set of options (this would for example apply if all flights with short travel time turned out to have only one leg) are moved up in the tree even if the attribute has a low rank (see Section 3.4).",
        "A difference is that our UMSR model treats the user's valuation as a more important feature for dialog structuring than associations.",
        "Coping with Under-and Over-constrained User Queries.",
        "One frequent problem in spoken dialogs is caused by under-and over-constrained queries.",
        "In under-constrained queries, the database returns too many results to be presented at once, and the system must support users in further refining their query.",
        "In an over-constrained query, there are no entries in the database that match the query exactly, and the system thus has to get the user to relax a constraint, or itself choose a constraint to relax.",
        "Our UMSR system differentiates between cases that concern missing information about obligatory slots (e.g., origin, destination,and date) and underspecified preferences (concerning preferred airlines, etc.).",
        "To fill the obligatory slots, simple slot-filling questions such as When do you want to leave?",
        "are asked.",
        "For all other cases of over-or under-constrained queries, constraint relaxation and specification is inherent in the UMSR structuring approach.",
        "For underspecified preferences, the user model provides default specifications.",
        "In the case of over-constrained queries, we can think of constraint relaxation in terms of the tree structure: Constraints that are less important to the user (e.g., price for our example business user) are automatically relaxed simply because they are located further down in the option tree.",
        "Constraint values, namely, good arrival time being changed to fair, are automatically relaxed due to the ordering of the branches within the option tree.",
        "Various strategies for coping with over-and under-constrained queries have been developed in the literature.",

        "Additionally, constraints can be relaxed automatically based an ontology (Varges, Weng, and Pon-Barry 2006) or by predefining relaxation sets (e.g., from a specific street for a restaurant to the broader neighborhood) or categorical ones (e.g., relaxing Chinese to Asian) (Chung 2004)."

      "text": [
        "The research presented in this article addresses the issue of how to scale information presentation strategies for spoken dialog systems to situations where many diverse options are available.",
        "We developed an approach that combines content selection with content structuring, and showed how a user model can inform both of these steps to optimize efficiency and effectiveness of the information presentation phase in spoken dialog systems.",
        "The knowledge derived from the user model can be used to enable a dialog system to automatically present trade-offs between the relevant entities explicitly, thus improving the user's overview of the option space, and contrast options using linguistic and discourse cues.",
        "In our experiments, we found that the user model-directed approach led to shorter dialogs and that it improved task success: Users found the optimal option more often and were more satisfied with their experience.",
        "We tested this with three studies, a reading experiment, an overhearer experiment, and a Wizard-of-Oz experiment, thus providing what we believe is the first large-scale evaluation of alternative information presentation strategies that actually investigates how users interact with the dialog system to perform a task.",
        "One significant contribution of the UMSR approach for intelligent information presentation is that it guides users through the dialog by presenting only options that are likely to be of high relevance to them, thus reducing the reliance on user speech.",
        "UMSR exploits information from the user model to provide users with the opportunity to select between the most suitable options available.",
        "It computes the trade-offs between options to most effectively narrow down the number of options.",
        "This way, considerably fewer turns are required per dialog in comparison with the SR approach, the average dialog duration is shorter, and the optimal option (i.e., flight) is booked more often.",
        "We conclude that combining a summarize and refine approach with user modeling is a very promising approach to improving the user experience in terms of achieving higher task success and increasing efficiency.",
        "However, there are also other parts of the presentation that could be tailored to the user (e.g., in adaptive option clustering).",
        "Although we used heuristics for how to exploit the information from the user model for content structuring, a very important next step would be to analyze the relationship between the user's valuations and how they explore the option space.",
        "It is conceivable that other ways of organizing the options could lead to even shorter refinement paths and quicker interactions.",
        "Concerning dialog turn length and complexity, we believe that better formal methods are needed in order to automatically estimate the cognitive burden placed on a user during the dialog interaction.",
        "We now briefly address these issues.",
        "Tailored Clustering.",
        "The user model can also be used for further tailoring the system responses to the user by taking into account the user's valuations during the clustering step.",
        "Instead of using a fixed number of target clusters, it would be better to use a flexible number of natural clusters that the data fall into.",
        "This would make the labeling more difficult, but would make clusters (and therefore descriptions of option properties) more meaningful.",
        "Furthermore, the distance function used for clustering could be sensitive to the user model.",
        "For instance, the price axis used during clustering for a student who cares very much about price could be more fine-grained in the most relevant low price range.",
        "An Adaptive User Model for Turn Length.",
        "We learned from our experiments and related work that turn length is important to control.",
        "Although we found that our system tended to produce turns that were often rather complex, in a study about choosing the optimal amount of information to convey to users, Whittaker, Walker, and Maloor (2003) found that subjects are biased towards more information.",
        "This means that providing an insufficient amount of information is perceived as worse than presenting too many details.",
        "Whittaker, Walker, and Maloor's results also indicated that conciseness should be tailored to users, because some users appreciate conciseness more than others.",
        "Our system does not currently tailor turn length to specific users, because our user model does not contain information about a user's conciseness preferences, or situational data, such as whether they are in a hurry, or can only devote a limited amount of attention on the task.",
        "Furthermore, Polifroni and Walker (2008) found in their user study that people who are not very familiar with the available options (e.g., tourists in a foreign city searching the restaurant domain) appreciate potentially longer, tailored summaries more than users who are very familiar with the data and know more precisely what they are looking for – such users preferred a simple refinement strategy or refinement with association over a user model-based recommendation.",
        "Exploring the Relationship between the User Model and Optimal Dialog Structure (Minimize Exploration Need).",
        "We have shown that presenting users first with those options that are most relevant according to their user model improved efficiency over using an order which minimizes entropy but does not take into account the user model.",
        "However, we have not shown that this is necessarily the best possible order.",
        "Therefore, it would be interesting to run a more large-scale user experiment in which users use the system in an even more natural setting for booking flights that match their own interests, analyzing how often users explore more than one branch in the tree as a function of the tree structure.",
        "Having to investigate different branches of the tree is an indicator that the tree structure is not optimal.",
        "This information could then be used to improve on the content structuring algorithm and learn more about the relationship between the user model and users' exploration strategies and interests when performing the task.",
        "Measures ofCognitive Load.",
        "An interesting aspect in information presentation is also how much cognitive load the system-generated utterances place on the user.",
        "In this work, we try to manage cognitive load by controlling how many pieces of information are conveyed in one system turn.",
        "This is, however, a very coarse measure, as different linguistic factors have also been shown to affect cognitive load on users.",
        "For example, surprising or incoherent information structure has been observed to be more difficult to process (Vauras, Hyona, and Niemi 1992; Van Gompel, Liversedge, and Pearson 2004), and complex syntactic structures (e.g., long-distance dependencies) have been shown to impose difficulty (Gibson 1998).",
        "Language processing difficulty is also affected by frequency: Less frequent structures and words are more difficult to process than more frequent ones (Ehrlich and Rayner 1981; Rayner 1998; Rayner et al.",
        "1998).",
        "Furthermore, lexical access (Pollatsek and Rayner 1990) and word predictability (Rayner et al.",
        "2001) have also been shown to play a role.",
        "Finally, deciding what is an information unit and estimating how difficult they are to remember (and recall) for a particular user is not a trivial task, and is highly dependent on individual differences in affect, aptitude, intelligence, episodic memory, and so on.",
        "Therefore, a more fine-grained estimation of the cognitive load imposed on a user based on the number of information units to remember, the syntactic structure of the generated sentences, and their semantic coherence would allow the system to adapt to situational constraints (e.g., generate less complex but potentially less efficient interactions if the user is performing another task simultaneously), or to a specific user in order to account for age or disabilities.",
        "In order to begin addressing some of these issues, and to gain further insight into what makes presentations based on the UMSR approach so successful, we have recently performed experiments investigating the role of linguistic devices to explicitly point out trade-offs among options (e.g., but, also, just, only), which are used in UMSR presentations to highlight relations among and trade-offs between options.",
        "We found that in both written and spoken presentations of options, those that include these linguistic devices facilitate recall for comparisons among options, when compared to a condition in which presentations do not include such linguistic cues (Winterboer 2009; Winterboer et al.",
        "2011).",
        "In future work, we plan to consider how the syntactic complexity of the sentences in a presentation affects cognitive load, and how this interacts with both the number of options and attributes presented, and the use of linguistic devices to point out trade-offs."
