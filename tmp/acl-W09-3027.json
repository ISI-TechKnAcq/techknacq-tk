        "However, because real text on the Web is often complex in nature, we target a simpler and more fundamental unit of meaning which we call the \"statement.\"",
        "To summarize opinions for the statement map users, we first convert all sentences into statements and then, organize them into groups of agreeing and conflicting opinions that show the logical support for each group.",
