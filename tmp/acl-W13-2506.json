        "There is a growing literature on using the Web for constructing various types of text collections, including monolingual, comparable, parallel and/or domain-specific corpora.",
        "Such resources can be used by linguists studying language use and change (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003), and at the same time they can be exploited in applied research fields like machine translation and multilingual information extraction.",
        "Moreover, these collections of raw data can be automatically annotated and used to produce, by means of induction tools, a second order or synthesized derivatives: rich lexica (with morphological, syntactic and lexico-semantic information), large bilingual dictionaries (word andmultiword based) and transfer grammars.",
        "To this end, several tools (i.e. web crawlers, HTMLparsers, language identifiers, HTML cleaners, etc.)",
        "have been developed and combined in order to produce corpora useful for specific tasks.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the available systems either omit some processing tasks or require access to the results of a search engine.",
        "For instance, the BootCaT toolkit (Baroni et al., 2006), a well-known suite of Perl scripts for bootstrapping specialized language corpora from the web, uses the Bing search engine and allows up to 5,000 queries per month.",
        "In this paper, we present ILSP-FC, a modular system that includes components and methods for all the tasks required to acquire domain-specific corpora from the Web.",
        "The system is available as an open-source Java project1 and due to its modular architecture, each of its components can be easily substituted by alternatives with the same functionalities.",
        "Depending on user-defined configuration, the crawler employs processing workflows for the creation of either monolingual or bilingual collections.",
        "For users wishing to try the system before downloading it, two web services2 allow them to experiment with different configuration settings for the construction of monolingual and bilingual domain-specific corpora.",
        "The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we refer to recent related work.",
        "In Section 3, we describe in detail the workflow of the proposed system.",
        "A solution for bootstrapping the focused crawler input is presented in Section 4.",
        "Then, an experiment on acquiring parallel documents in German and Italian for the \"Health & Safety at work\" domain (H&S) is described in Section 5, which also includes evaluation results on a set of criteria including parallelness and domain specificity.",
        "We conclude and mention future work in Section 6."
