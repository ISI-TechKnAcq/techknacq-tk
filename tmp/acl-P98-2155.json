        "In speech synthesis systems, near-perfect (98%) accent assignment is automatically attainable for read-aloud, citation-style speech (Hirschberg, 1993).",
        "But for unrestricted, extended spontaneous discourses, highly natural accentuation is often achieved only by costly human post-editing.",
        "A better understanding of the effects of discourse context on accentual variation is needed not only to fully model this fundamental prosodic feature for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems, but also to further the integration of prosody into speech understanding and concept-to-speech (CTS) synthesis systems at the appropriate level of linguistic representation.",
        "This paper presents an empirically motivated theory of the discourse focusing function of accent.",
        "The theory describes for the first time the interacting contributions to accent prediction made by factors related to the local and global attentional status of discourse referents in a discourse model (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "The ability of the focusing features to predict accent for a blind test corpus is examined using machine learning.",
        "Because attentional status is a property of referring expressions, a novel approach to accent prediction is proposed to allow for the integration of word-based and constituent-based linguistic features in the models to be learned.",
        "The task of accent assignment is redefined as the prediction of patterns of deviation from citation form accentuation.",
        "Crucially, these deviations are captured at the constituent level.",
        "This task redefinition has two novel properties: (1) it bootstraps directly on knowledge about citation form or so-called \"context-independent\" prosody embodied in current TTS technology; and (2) the abstraction from word to constituent allows for the natural integration of focusing features into the prediction methods.",
        "Results of the constituent-based accent prediction experiments show that for two speakers from a corpus of spontaneous direction-giving monologues, accent assignment can be improved by up to 4%-6% relative to a hypothetical baseline system that would produce only citation-form accentuation, giving error rate reductions of 11%-25%."

        "Much theoretical work on intonational meaning has focused on the association of accent with NEW information, and lack of accent with GIVEN information, where given and new are defined with respect to whether or not the information is already represented in a discourse model.",
        "While this association reflects a general tendency (Brown, 1983), empirical studies on longer discourses have shown this simple dichotomy cannot explain important subclasses of expressions, such as accented pronouns, cf. (Terken, 1984; Hirschberg, 1993).",
        "We propose a new theory of the relationship between accent and attention, based on an enriched taxonomy of given/new information status provided by both the LOCAL (centering) and GLOBAL (focus stack model) attentional state models in Grosz and Sidner' s discourse modeling theory (1986).",
        "Analysis of a 20-minute spontaneous storytelling monologue' identified separate but interacting contributions of grammatical function, form of referring expression and accentuation2 in conveying the attentional status of a discourse referent.",
        "These interactions can be formally expressed in the framework of attentional modeling by the following principles of interpretation:",
        "• The LEXICAL FORM OF A REFERRING EXPRESSION indicates the level of attentional processing, i.e., pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "• The GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION of a referring expression reflects the local attentional status of the referent, i.e., subject position generally holds the highest ranking member of the forward-looking centers list (Cf list), while direct object holds the next highest ranking member of the Cf list (Grosz et al., 1995; Kameyama, 1985).",
        "• The ACCENTING of a referring expression serves as an inference cue to shift attention to a new backward-looking center (Cb), or to mark the global (re)introduction of a referent; LACK OF ACCENT serves as an inference cue to maintain attentional focus on the Cb, Cf list members or global referents (Nakatani, 1997).",
        "The third principle concerning accent interpretation defines for the first time how accent serves uniformly to shift attention and lack of accent serves to maintain attention, at either the local or global level of discourse structure.",
        "This principle describing the discourse focusing functions of accent directly explains 86.5% (173/200) of the referring expressions in the spontaneous narrative, as shown in Table 1.",
        "If performance factors (e.g. repairs, interruptions) and special discourse situations (e.g. direct quotations) are also considered accounted for, then coverage increases to 96.5% (193/200)."

        "In general, constituent-based accentuation is most accurately learned from lexical information readily available in TTS systems.",
        "For CTS systems, comparable performance may be achieved using only higher level attentional features.",
        "There are several other lessons to be learned, concerning individual speaker, domain dependent and domain independent effects on accent modeling.",
        "First, it is perhaps counterintuitively harder to predict deviations from citation form accentuation for speakers who exhibit a great deal of non-citation-style accenting behavior, such as speaker H3.",
        "Accent prediction results for HI exceeded those for H3, although about 15% more of I-13's tokens exhibited non-citation form accentuation.",
        "Finding the appropriate parameters by which to describe the prosody of individual speakers is an important goal that can be advanced by using machine learning techniques to explore large spaces of hypotheses.",
        "Second, it is evident from the strong performance of the word lemma sequence models that deviations from citation-form accentuation may often be expressed by lexicalized rules of some sort.",
        "Lexical-ized rules in fact have proven useful in other areas of natural language statistical modeling, such as POS tagging (Brill, 1995) and parsing (Collins, 1996).",
        "The specific lexicalized rules learned for many of the models would not have followed from any theoretical or empirical proposals in the literature.",
        "It may be that domain dependent training using au",
        "tomatic learning is the appropriate way to develop practical models of accenting patterns on different corpora.",
        "And especially for different speakers in the same domain, automatic learning methods seem to be the only efficient way to capture perhaps idiolec-tical variation in accenting.",
        "Finally, it should be noted that notwithstanding individual speaker and domain dependent effects, domain independent factors identified by the new theory of accent and attention do contribute to experimental performance.",
        "The two local focusing features, grammatical function and form of referring expression, enable improvements above the citation-form baseline, especially in combination with lexical information.",
        "Global focusing information is of limited use by itself, but as may have been hypothesized, contributes to accent prediction in combination with local focus, lexical and syntactic features."
