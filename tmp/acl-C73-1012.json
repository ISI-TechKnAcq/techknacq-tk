        "This work represents an attempt to utilize the computer in solving problems in historical linguistics.",
        "The corpus upon which it operates.",
        "is not a language but a recently published etymological dictionary of Old Cornish.' Any observations regarding the scarcity or inaccuracy of the data utilized are, therefore, irrelevant, as far as the present paper is concerned.",
        "As the dictionary in question was compiled according to the usual methods employed with such works, a detailed explanation of methodology is unnecessary.",
        "It should also be noted that Old Cornish is known only through glosses to Latin words, and that in this case Cornish gloss » is equivalent to Cornish word ».",
        "With the help of the computer, we have attempted to solve the following problems: a) To establish the percentage of words with and without Indo-European etymology in the Cornish lexicon.",
        "(Let us stress that this study concerns not a language but an etymological lexicon; hence, the presence or absence of Indo-European etymology should not be construed as a definitive characteristic of a Cornish word.",
        "Such statistics are, in fact, relevant only to the present state of research on the subject).",
        "b) To establish the degree of certainty concerning the material of Indo-European etymology.",
        "c) To evaluate the extent of the connection between elements of Indo-European etymology existing in the Cornish lexicon and the other Indo-European linguistic groups according to the degree of certainty of each individual etymology.",
        "d) To establish, on the basis of existing etymological studies of Old Cornish, the lines future research should follow.",
        "The reader will observe that the first problem is purely statistical (though it has an obvious diachronic premise), that the second aims at attaining qualitative data (though they are expressed quantitatively), that the third concerns the area of Indo-European dialectology, and that the fourth has its own specific heuristic and methodological significance.",
        "In order to accomplish these goals, the contents of the etymological dictionary were put on cards, each of which contained the following entries:",
        "a) a non-Cornish word (with an indication of the language to which it belongs) ; b) the Cornish word related in the dictionary to the item under a) ; c) the type of relationship existing between item a) and item b) ; and whether this relationship is affirmed, denied or uncertain; d) the indication that item b) is or is not a nominal compound (this being the only type of compound found in Old Cornish) ; e) in the event that item b) is a nominal compound, a breakdown of the elements contained in it; 2 f) the page from which the foregoing material was taken.",
        "With regard to item c) , the possible types of relationships have been described (see below) according to the information supplied, either explicitly or implicitly, by the etymological dictionary and have been rated according to the following numerical system:",
        "82 = a relationship exists between the Cornish word and item a), but the nature of the relationship cannot be determined exactly (that is, whether it is a matter of kinship or loan) ."

        "On the other hand, there are two non-Indo-European languages in group 17 because one Cornish word is thought to have a kinship with non-Lido-European words.",
        "Each of the 742 words has an etymological kinship with Cornish words that is either certain (rating 1), very probable (rating 2) or probable (rating 3).",

        "Here are the results:",
        "It will be observed that the Celtic group appears to be poorly represented in that the existing etymological kinship with Cornish words is normally expressed by the rating 9 (and not, therefore, 1,2 or 3), while the rank of 1,2 or 3 has been attributed only to those words which, though still within the Celtic group, are part of other linguistic traditions (words of the Celtic substratum in the romance languages, for example).",

        "Such results appear to be extremely important in that they confirm the innovative character of the occidental lexicon (kinships with German, Latin and, at least in part, Baltic) existing side with the preservation of archaic elements in lateral areas (kinship with Indo-Aryan), thereby showing strong kinships with the central area of the Indo-European world (Greek and, at least in part, Baltic) which have yet to be adequately assessed.",

        "This, together with the fact that these same groups have also yielded a very high percentage of acceptable etymologies, suggests that these areas have been exhausted.",
        "As working hypothesis, new etymological comparisons ought now to be considered particularly with German and Baltic, which combine a high yield with a more tolerable percentage of acknowledged errors (0.0850 and 0.0750 respectively).",
        "170 E. CAMPANILE - A. ZAMPOLLI 5) Of the 745 Cornish words which have supplied the material for the present study, as many as 671, almost 90 %, bear at least an index of 9; that is, have one or more Celtic co-radicals.",
        "This confirms the K compact » character of the Celtic lexicon.",
        "Moreover, there are Cornish words which have one or more indices of 9 to the exclusion of any other index (139; 18 %).",
        "These are words that have co-radicals exclusively in the Celtic world.",
        "On the heuristic level, this verification gives rise to a question that is at the same time a working hypothesis: are they substratum words ?",
        "The same question and the same working hypothesis also arise with the words where one or more indices of 9 accompany the indices 4, 5, 6, 7: these are words with Celtic co-radicals formerly thought to be of Indo-European etymology but now refuted in the dictionary, They are 60.",
        "Our analysis, therefore, seems to suggest, too, that future linguistic research will find rich material for substratum studies in Cornish and, more generally, in Celtic."
