        "BLEU and TER scores, we still want to understand the reason of the relatively small improvement.",
        "After some error analysis, we found that in the testset only 2.5% of Arabic words are names with English spelling variants.",
        "Among them, 73% name spelling errors can be corrected with the translation spelling variants obtained in section 5.1.",
        "Because the MT system is trained on the same bilingual data from which the name spelling variants are extracted, some of these Arabic names are already correctly translated in the baseline system.",
        "So the room of improvement is small.",
        "We did an oracle experiment, manually correcting the name translation errors in the first 10 documents (89 sentences with 2545 words).",
        "With only 6 name translation errors corrected, this reduced the TER from 48.83 to 48.65.",
        "Mention detection system experiments are conducted on the ACE 2007 data sets in Arabic and English.",
        "Since the evaluation test set is not publicly available, we have split the publicly available training corpus into an 85%/15% data split.",
        "To facilitate future comparisons with work presented here, and to simulate a realistic scenario, the splits are created based on article dates: the test data is selected as the latest 15% of the data in chronological order.",
        "This way, the documents in the training and test data sets do not overlap in time, and the content of the test data is more recent than the training data.",
        "For English we use 499 documents for training and 100 documents for testing, while for Arabic we use 323 documents for training and 56 documents for testing.",
        "English and Arabic mention detection systems are using a large range of features, including lexical (e.g., words and morphs in a 3-word window, prefixes and suffixes of length up to 4, stems in a 4-word window for Arabic), syntactic (POS tags, text chunks), and the output of other information extraction models.",
        "These features were described in (Zitouni and Florian, 2008 & Florian et al.",
        "2007) with more details.",
        "Our goal here is to investigate the effectiveness of name spelling variants information in improving mention detection system performance.",
        "Table 7: Performance of English and Arabic mention detection systems without (Baseline) and with (Baseline+NSV) the use of name spelling variants.",
        "Performance is presented in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R), and F-measure (F).",
        "Results in Table 7 show that the use of name spelling variants (NSV) improves mention detection systems performance, especially for English; an interesting improvement is obtained in recall - which is to be expected, given the method -, but also in precision, leading to systems with better performance in terms of F-measure (82.4 vs. 82.7).",
        "This improvement in performance is statistically significant according to the stratified bootstrap re-sampling approach (Noreen 1989).",
        "This approach is used in the named entity recognition shared task of CoNLL-2002 .",
        "However, the small improvement obtained for Arabic is not statistically significant based on the approach described earlier.",
        "One hypothesis is that Arabic name spelling variants are not rich enough and that a better tuning of the alignment score is required to improve precision."
