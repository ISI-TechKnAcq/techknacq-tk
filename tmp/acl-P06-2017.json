        "Sound systems of the world’s languages show remarkable regularities.",
        "Any arbitrary set of consonants and vowels does not make up the sound system of a particular language.",
        "Several lines of research suggest that cross-linguistic similarities get reflected in the consonant and vowel inventories of the languages all over the world (Greenberg, 1966; Pinker, 1994; Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996).",
        "Previously it has been argued that these similarities are the results of certain general principles like maximal perceptual contrast (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988), feature economy (Martinet, 1968; Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004) and robustness (Jakobson and Halle, 1956; Chomsky and Halle, 1968).",
        "Maximal perceptual contrast between the phonemes of a language is desirable for proper perception in a noisy environment.",
        "In fact the organization of the vowel inventories across languages has been satisfactorily explained in terms of the single principle of maximal perceptual contrast (Jakobson, 1941; Wang, 1968).",
        "There have been several attempts to reason the observed patterns in consonant inventories since 1930s (Trubetzkoy, 1969/1939; Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Flemming, 2002; Clements, 2004), but unlike the case of vowels, the structure of consonant inventories lacks a complete and holistic explanation (de Boer, 2000).",
        "Most of the works are confined to certain individual principles (Abry, 2003; Hinskens and Wei-jer, 2003) rather than formulating a general theory describing the structural patterns and/or their stability.",
        "Thus, the structure of the consonant inventories continues to be a complex jigsaw puzzle, though the parts and pieces are known.",
        "In this work we attempt to represent the cross-linguistic similarities that exist in the consonant inventories of the world’s languages through a bipartite network named PlaNet (the Phoneme Language Network).",
        "PlaNet has two different sets of nodes, one labeled by the languages while the other labeled by the consonants.",
        "Edges run between these two sets depending on whether or not a particular consonant occurs in a particular language.",
        "This representation is motivated by similar modeling of certain complex phenomena observed in nature and society, such as, • Movie-actor network, where movies and actors constitute the two partitions and an edge between them signifies that a particular actor acted in a particular movie (Ramasco et al., 2004).",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "• Article-author network, where the edges denote which person has authored which articles (Newman, 2001b).",
        "• Metabolic network of organisms, where the corresponding partitions are chemical com",
        "pounds and metabolic reactions.",
        "Edges run between partitions depending on whether a particular compound is a substrate or result of a reaction (Jeong et al., 2000).",
        "Modeling of complex systems as networks has proved to be a comprehensive and emerging way of capturing the underlying generating mechanism of such systems (for a review on complex networks and their generation see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003)).",
        "There have been some attempts as well to model the intricacies of human languages through complex networks.",
        "Word networks based on synonymy (Yook et al., 2001b), co-occurrence (Cancho et al., 2001), and phonemic edit-distance (Vitevitch, 2005) are examples of such attempts.",
        "The present work also uses the concept of complex networks to develop a platform for a holistic analysis as well as synthesis of the distribution of the consonants across the languages.",
        "In the current work, with the help of PlaNet we provide a systematic study of certain interesting features of the consonant inventories.",
        "An important property that we observe is the two regime power law degree distribution1 of the nodes labeled by the consonants.",
        "We try to explain this property in the light of the size of the consonant inventories coupled with the principle ofpreferen-tial attachment (Barab´asi and Albert, 1999).",
        "Next we present a simplified mathematical model explaining the emergence of the two regimes.",
        "In order to support our analytical explanations, we also provide a synthesis model for PlaNet.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized into five sections.",
        "In section 2 we formally define PlaNet, outline its construction procedure and present some studies on its degree distribution.",
        "We dedicate section 3 to state and explain the inferences that can be drawn from the degree distribution studies of PlaNet.",
        "In section 4 we provide a simplified theoretical explanation of the analytical results ob",

        "In section 5 we present a synthesis model for PlaNet to hold up the inferences that we draw in section 3.",
        "Finally we conclude in section 6 by summarizing our contributions, pointing out some of the implications of the current work and indicating the possible future directions."

        "In most of the networked systems like the society, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many others, power law degree distribution emerges for the phenomenon of preferential attachment, i.e., when “the rich get richer” (Simon, 1955).",
        "With reference to PlaNet this preferential attachment can be interpreted as the tendency of a language to choose a consonant that has been already chosen by a large number of other languages.",

        "Whereas the power law distribution is well understood, the reason for the two distinct regimes (with a sharp break) still remains unexplored.",
        "We hypothesize that, Hypothesis The typical distribution of the consonant inventory size over languages coupled with the principle of preferential attachment enforces the two distinct regimes to appear in the power law curves.",
        "As the average consonant inventory size in UPSID317 is 21, so following the principle of preferential attachment, on an average, the first 21 most frequent consonants are much more preferred than the rest.",
        "Consequently, the nature of the frequency distribution for the highly frequent consonants is different from the less frequent ones, and hence there is a transition from Regime 1 to Regime 2 in the Figure 3(a) and (b).",

But the case is different for the 22nd consonant, which is chosen by a language if it has previously chosen zero, one, two, or at most 20, but tained for PlaNet.",

        "Until now we have been mainly dealing with the computational aspects of the distribution of consonants over the languages rather than exploring the real world dynamics that gives rise to such a distribution.",
        "An issue that draws immediate attention is that how preferential attachment, which is a general phenomenon associated with network evolution, can play a prime role in shaping the consonant inventories of the world’s languages.",
        "The answer perhaps is hidden in the fact that language is an evolving system and its present structure is determined by its past evolutionary history.",
        "Indeed an explanation based on this evolutionary model, with an initial disparity in the distribution of consonants over languages, can be intuitively verified as follows – let there be a language community of N speakers communicating among themselves by means of only two consonants say /�/ and /g/.",
        "If we assume that every speaker has l descendants and language inventories are transmitted with high fidelity, then after i generations it is expected that the community will consist of mlz /�/ speakers and nlz /g/ speakers.",

        "Stated differently, the /�/ speakers by far outnumbers the /g/ speakers even if initially the number of /�/ speakers is only slightly higher than that of the /g/ speakers.",
        "This phenomenon is similar to that of preferential attachment where language communities get attached to, i.e., select, consonants that are already highly preferred.",
        "Nevertheless, it remains to be seen where from such an initial disparity in the distribution of the consonants over languages might have originated.",
