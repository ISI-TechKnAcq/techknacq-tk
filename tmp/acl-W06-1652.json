        "It is common for different features to overlap representationally.",
        "For example, the unigram “happy” will match all of the texts that the bigram “very happy” matches.",
        "Since both features represent a positive sentiment and the bigram matches fewer contexts than the unigram, it is probably sufficient just to have the unigram.",
        "However, there are many cases where a feature captures a subtlety or non-compositional meaning that a simpler feature does not.",
        "For example, “basket case” is a highly opinionated phrase, but the words “basket” and “case” individually are not.",
        "An open question in opinion analysis is how often more complex feature representations are needed, and which types of features are most valuable.",
        "Our first goal is to devise a method to automatically identify features that are representationally subsumed by a simpler feature but that are better opinion indicators.",
        "These subjective expressions could then be added to a subjectivity lexicon (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), and used to gain understanding about which types of complex features capture meaningful expressions that are important for opinion recognition.",
        "Many opinion classifiers are created by adopting a “kitchen sink” approach that throws together a variety of features.",

        "For example, Pang et al.",
        "(2002) found that unigrams outperformed bigrams, and unigrams outperformed the combination of unigrams plus bigrams.",
        "Our second goal is to automatically identify features that are unnecessary because similar features provide equal or better coverage and discriminatory value.",
        "Our hypothesis is that a reduced feature set, which selectively combines unigrams with only the most valuable complex features, will perform better than a larger feature set that includes the entire “kitchen sink” of features.",

        "For example, they found that passive-voice constructions of the verb “ask” had a 100% correlation with opinion sentences, but active-voice constructions had only a 63% correlation with opinions.",

        "An extraction pattern may also subsume another extraction pattern.",
        "For example, “<subj> ActVP(recommended)” subsumes “<subj> ActVP(recommended) Dobj(movie)”.",
        "To compare specific features we need to formally define the representation of each type of feature in the hierarchy.",
        "For example, the hierarchy dictates that a 2Gram can subsume the pattern “ActInfVP <dobj>”, but this should hold only if the words in the bigram correspond to adjacent words in the pattern.",
        "For example, the 2Gram “to fish” subsumes the pattern “ActInfVP(like to fish) <dobj>”.",

        "Consequently, we decided that a bigram (e.g., “to protest”) should representationally subsume this extraction pattern because the syntactic flexibility afforded by the pattern is negligible.",

        "Many features and classification algorithms have been explored in sentiment analysis and opinion recognition.",
        "Lexical cues of differing complexities have been used, including single words and Ngrams (e.g., (Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004)), as well as phrases and lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g, (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Whitelaw et al., 2005)).",
        "While many of these studies investigate combinations of features and feature selection, this is the first work that uses the notion of subsumption to compare Ngrams and lexico-syntactic patterns to identify complex features that outperform simpler counterparts and to reduce a combined feature set to improve opinion classification."
