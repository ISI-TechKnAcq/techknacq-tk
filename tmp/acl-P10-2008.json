        "The general approach to authorship attribution is to extract a number of style markers from the text and use these style markers as features to train a classifier (Burrows, 1987; Binongo and Smith, 1999; Diederich et al., 2000; Holmes and Forsyth, 1995; Joachims, 1998; Mosteller and Wallace, 1984).",

        "We had 5 different datasets in total - Football, Business, Travel, Cricket, and Poetry.",
        "The number of authors in our datasets ranged from 3 to 6.",
        "For each dataset, we split the documents into training and test sets.",
        "Previous studies (Stamatatos et al., 1999) have observed that having unequal number of words per author in the training set leads to poor performance for the authors with fewer words.",

        "We would like to note that we could have also selected the training set such that the total number of sentences per author was roughly the same.",
        "However, since we would like to compare the performance of the PCFG-based approach with a bag-of-words baseline, we decided to normalize the training set based on the number of words, rather than sentences.",

        "However, since the number of documents per author is relatively low, this leads to very sparse training data.",
        "Therefore, we also augmented the training data by adding one, two or three sections of the WSJ or Brown corpus to each training set, and up-sampling (replicating) the data from the original author.",
        "We refer to this model as \"PCFG-/\", where I stands for interpolation since this effectively exploits linear interpolation with the base corpus to smooth parameters.",
        "Based on our preliminary experiments, we replicated the original data three or four times.",

        "Preliminary experiments verified that eliminating stop words degraded performance; therefore, we did not remove them.",
        "We used the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Naive Bayes classifiers in the MALLET software package (McCallum, 2002) as initial baselines.",
        "We surmised that a discriminative classifier like MaxEnt might perform better than a generative classifier like Naive Bayes.",
        "However, when sufficient training data is not available, generative models are known to perform better than discriminative models (Ng and Jordan, 2001).",

        "We used the same background corpus mixing method used for the PCFG-I model to effectively smooth the n-gram models.",
        "Since a generative model like Naive Bayes that uses n-gram frequencies is equivalent to an n-gram language model, we also used the Naive Bayes classifier in MALLET to implement the n-gram models.",
        "Note that a Naive-Bayes bag-of-words model is equivalent to a unigram language model.",
        "While the PCFG model captures the author's writing style at the syntactic level, it may not accurately capture lexical information.",
        "Since both syntactic and lexical information is presumably useful in capturing the author's overall writing style, we also developed an ensemble using a PCFG model, the bag-of-words MaxEnt classifier, and an n-gram language model.",
        "We linearly combined the confidence scores assigned by each model to each author, and used the combined score for the final classification.",
        "We refer to this model as \"PCFG-E\", where E stands for ensemble.",
        "We also developed another ensemble based on MaxEnt and n-gram language models to demonstrate the contribution of the PCFG model to the overall performance of PCFG-E. For each dataset, we report accuracy, the fraction of the test documents whose authors were correctly identified.",

        "For the n-gram models, we only report the results for the bigram model with smoothing (Bigram-I) as it was the best performing model for most datasets (except for Cricket and Poetry).",
        "For the Cricket dataset, the trigram-I model was the best performing n-gram model with an accuracy of 98.34%.",
        "Generally, a higher order n-gram model (n = 3 or higher) performs poorly as it requires a fair amount of smoothing due to the exponential increase in all possible n-gram combinations.",
        "Hence, the superior performance of the trigram-I model on the Cricket dataset was a surprising result.",
        "For the Poetry dataset, the unigram-I model performed best among the smoothed n-gram models at 81.8% accuracy.",
        "This is unsurprising because as mentioned above, topic information is strongest in the Poetry dataset, and it is captured well in the unigram model.",
        "For bag-of-words methods, we find that the generatively trained Naive Bayes model (unigram language model) performs better than or equal to the discriminatively trained MaxEnt model on most datasets (except for Business).",
        "This result is not suprising since our datasets are limited in size, and generative models tend to perform better than discriminative methods when there is very little training data available.",
        "Amongst the different baseline models (MaxEnt, Naive Bayes, Bigram-1), we find Bigram-I to be the best performing model (except for Cricket and Poetry).",

        "For Football, the basic PCFG model outperforms the best baseline, while for Poetry, the PCFG-/ model outperforms the best baseline.",
        "Further, the performance of the basic PCFG model is inferior to that of PCFG-/ for most datasets, likely due to the insufficient training data used in the basic model.",
        "Ideally one would use more training documents, but in many domains it is impossible to obtain a large corpus of documents written by a single author.",
        "For example, as Luyckx and Daelemans (2008) argue, in forensics one would like to identify the authorship of documents based on a limited number of documents written by the author.",
        "Hence, we investigated smoothing techniques to improve the performance of the basic PCFG model.",
        "We found that the interpolation approach resulted in a substantial improvement in the performance of the PCFG model for all but the Football dataset (discussed below).",
        "However, for some datasets, even this improvement was not sufficient to outperform the best baseline.",
        "The results for PCFG and PCFG-/ demonstrate that syntactic information alone is generally a bit less accurate than using n-grams.",
        "In order to utilize both syntactic and lexical information, we developed PCFG-E as described above.",
        "We combined the best n-gram model (Bigram-/) and PCFG model (PCFG-/) with MaxEnt to build",

        "While the basic PCFG model outperforms the baseline for the Football dataset, PCFG-E outperforms the best baseline for the Poetry and Business datasets.",
        "For the Cricket and Travel datasets, the performance of the PCFG-E model equals that of the best baseline.",
        "In order to assess the statistical significance of any performance difference between the best PCFG model and the best baseline, we performed the McNemar's test, a non-parametric test for binomial variables (Rosner, 2005).",
        "We found that the difference in the performance of the two methods was not statistically significant at .05 significance level for any of the datasets, probably due to the small number of test samples.",
        "The performance of PCFG and PCFG-/ is particularly impressive on the Football and Poetry datasets.",
        "For the Football dataset, the basic PCFG model is the best performing PCFG model and it performs much better than other methods.",
        "It is surprising that smoothing using PCFG-/ actually results in a drop in performance on this dataset.",
        "We hypothesize that the authors in the Football dataset may have very different syntactic writing styles that are effectively captured by the basic PCFG model.",
        "Smoothing the data apparently weakens this signal, hence causing a drop in performance.",
        "For Poetry, PCFG-/ achieves much higher accuracy than the baselines.",
        "This is impressive given the much looser syntactic structure of poetry compared to news articles, and it indicates the value of syntactic information for distinguishing between literary authors.",
        "Finally, we consider the specific contribution of the PCFG-/ model towards the performance of the PCFG-E ensemble.",
        "Based on comparing the results for PCFG-E and MaxEnt+Bigram-/, we find that there is a drop in performance for most datasets when removing PCFG-/ from the ensemble.",
        "This drop is quite substantial for the Football and Poetry datasets.",
        "This indicates that PCFG-/ is contributing substantially to the performance of PCFG-E.",
