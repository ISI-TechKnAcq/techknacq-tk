        "Automatic solutions are nowadays being sought both to make possible the comparison of different approaches by means of reliable indicators with generic evaluation methodologies and also to reduce system development costs.",
        "However achieving independence from both the dialog system and the task performed seems to be more and more a utopia.",
        "Most of the evaluations have up to now either tackled the system as a whole, or based the measurements on dialog-context-free information.",

        "Generally speaking common reference tasks (Whittaker et al., 2002) and methods to compare and diagnose spoken language dialog systems (SLDS) and spoken dialog techniques are lacking despite previous efforts futher discussed in the next section such as Eagles, Disc,Aupelf ArcB2 or the ongoing American project DARPA Communicator.",
        "Without an objective assessment of dialog systems, it is difficult to reuse previous work and to advance theories.",
        "The assessment of a dialog system is complex in part to the high integration factor and tight coupling between the various modules present in any SLDS, for which unfortunately today, no common accepted reference architecture exists.",
        "Nevertheless, a major problem remains the dynamic nature of dialog.",
        "Consequently to these shortcomings, researchers are often unable to provide principled design and system capabilities for technology transfer.",
        "In other research areas, such as speech recognition and information retrieval, common reference tasks have been highly effective in sharing research costs and efforts.",
        "A similar development is highly needed in the dialog community.",
        "In this contribution which addresses only a part of the SLDS evaluation problem, a paradigm for evaluating the context-sensitive understanding capability of any spoken language dialog system is proposed.",
        "PEACE (Devillers et al., 2002a) described in section 3, is based on test sets extracted from real corpora, and has three main aspects: it is generic, contextual and it offers diagnostic capabilities.",
        "Here genericity is envisaged in a context of information dialogs access.",
        "The diagnostic aspect is important in order to determine the different qualities of the systems under test.",
        "The contextual aspect of evaluation is a crucial point since dialog is dynamic by nature.",
        "We propose to simulate/synthesize the contextual information.",
        "The PEACE paradigm will be tested in the French Technolangue MEDIA project and will serve as basis in the comparison and diagnostic evaluation of systems presented by various academic and industrial sites (section 4).",

        "The objective of the European DISC project was to write the best-practice guidelines for SLDS development and evaluation of its time.",
        "DISC has collected a systematic list of bottom-up evaluation criteria, each corresponding to a partially ordered list of properties likely to be encountered in any SLDS.",
        "This properties are positioned on a grid defining an SLDS abstract architecture andre-late to various phases of the generic DISC SLDS development life-cycle (Dybkjœr and al., 1998).",
        "They are complemented by a standard evaluation pattern made of 10 generic questions (e.g. \"Which symptoms need to be observed?\"",
        ") which has been instantiated for all the evaluation criteria.",
        "If the DISC results are quite extensive and presented in an homogeneous way, they do not provide a direct answer to the question of SLDS evaluation.",
        "Its contribution lies more at the specification level.",
        "Although the approach and the goals of the European EAGLES project were different, one could forward the same remark about the results of the speech evaluation work group (D. Gibbon, 1997).",
        "In (Fraser, 1998), one find a set of evaluation criteria for voice oriented products and services, organized in four broad categories.",
        ": 1) voice command, 2) document generation, 3) phone services4) other.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the MADCOW (Multi Site Data Collection Working group) coordination group set up in the USA by ARPA in the context of the ATIS (Air Travel Information Services) task to collect corpora, was the first to propose a common infrastructure for SLDS automatic evaluation (MADCOW, 1992), which also addressed the problem of language understanding evaluation, based on system answer comparison.",
        "Unfortunately no direct diagnostic information can be produced, since understanding is appreciated by gauging the distance from the answer to a pair of minimal and a maximal reference answers.",
        "In ATIS, the protocol was only been applied to context free sentences.",
        "Up to now it has been one of the most used by the community since it is relatively objective and generic because it relies on counts of explicit information and allows for a certain variation in the answers.",
        "On the other hand, the method displays a bias toward silence and does not give the means to appreciate error severity.",
        "In ARISE (Automatic Railway Information Systems for Europe) (Lamel, 1998), a corpus of roughly 10,000 calls has been used in conjunction with user debriefing questionnaire analysis to diagnose different versions of a phone information server.",
        "The hand-tagging objective measures of the corpus include understanding error counts (glass box methodology).",
        "Although it provides fine grained diagnostic information, this procedure cannot be easily generalized since it requires handannotated corpus and access to the internal representation of the system.",
        "Two metrics have been developped at MIT (Glass et al., 2000): the Query Density (QD) and the Concept Efficiency (CE), which measure respectively over the course of a dialogue: the mean number of new concepts introduced per user query, and the number of turns necessary for each concept to be understood by the system.",
        "Concepts are generated automatically for each utterance with a parsable orthographic transcription as a series of keyword-value pairs.",
        "The higher the",
        "QD, the more effectively a user is able to communicate information to the system.",
        "The CE is an indicator of recognition or understanding errors; the higher it is, the fewer times a user needs to repeat himself.",
        "These metrics were evaluated on single systems (JUPITER and and MERCURY); to compare different systems of the same type, one would need a common ontology.",
        "In (Glass et al., 2000), the authors believe that CE should be related to user frustation, but to show it they would need to use the PARADISE framework.",
        "PARADISE (Walker et al., 1998) can be seen as a sort of meta-paradigm which correlates objective and subjective measurements.",
        "Its grounding hypothesis states that the goal of any SLDS is to achieve user-satisfaction, which in turn can be predicted through task success and various interaction costs.",
        "With the help of the kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) proposes to represent the dialog success independently from the task intrinsic complexity, thus opening the way to task generic comparative evaluation.",
        "PARADISE has been tested in the COMMUNICATOR project (Walker et al., 2001) with 9 systems working on the same task over different databases.",
        "With four basic measures (e.g. task completion) the protocol has been able to predict 37% of user satisfaction variation, and 42% with the help of a few extra measurements on dialog acts and subtasks.",
        "One critic, one can make about PARADISE concern its cost (real user tests are costly) and the use of subjective assessment.",
        "The adaption of the DQR text understanding evaluation methodology (Sabatier et al., 2000) to speech resulted in a generic and qualitative procedure.",
        "Each element of its test set holds three parts, the Declaration to define the context, a Question which bears on point present in the context and the Response.",
        "The test set is organized through seven levels of test, from basic explicit understanding to semantic interpretation and reply pertinence assessment.",
        "This protocol is task and system generic but test set construction is not straightforward and the bias introduced by the wording of the question is difficult to assess.",
        "Recently the GDR-13 work group of CNRS on spoken dialog understanding, has proposed an evaluation methodology for literal understanding.",
        "According to (Antoine and al., 2002), DEFI tries to remedy two important weaknesses of the MAD-COW methodology, namely the lack of genericity and the lack of diagnostic information, by crafting system specific test sets from a primary set of enunciations representative of the task (provided by the developers).",
        "Secondary enunciations are then derived from the primary ones in order to exhibit particular language phenomena.",
        "Afterwards, the systems are evaluated by their developers using specific test set and their own metrics.",
        "The various results can be mapped over a generic abstract architecture for comparison (although this mapping is still unspecified at the time of writing).",
        "DEFI has already been used in one evaluation campaign, with 5 systems presented by 4 laboratories.",
        "(Antoine and al., 2002) has reported the following weaknesses ofthe protocol: how to control the bias introduced by the derivation of enunciations, how to guaranty that derived enunciation will remain in the task scope (this prevented some system from being evaluated over the complete test set) and finally how to restrict and organize the language phenomena used in the test set."

        "Maynard et al., 2000).",
        "The dialog contexts are extracted from real dialogs in three steps.",
        "First, the internal semantic frames representing the dialog contexts are automatically extracted from the log files of the session recordings.",
        "Secondly, the semantic frames are converted into AVR format and then hand-corrected to faithfully represent the dialog history.",
        "The last step consists in the writing of a sentence for each context (the context paraphrase), which results in the same AVR representation as the one of the dialog context.",
        "Two possibilities may be investigated for building the paraphrase from the internal semantic representation of the dialog context.",
        "A rule-based or template-based natural language generation module can be used to automatically produce the paraphrase.",

        "It is then also possible to distinguish between different types of errors by defining specific operators (as used to estimate Topic identification in Table 1), or by using different cost values (for example a substitution is often considered more costly for dialog management).",
        "In order to validate the evaluation paradigm, a set of approximatively 1,700 literal units and a set of 100 contextual units has been used for the Paris-Siti task (Bonneau-Maynard and Dev-illers, 2000).",
        "Results for both literal and contextual understanding test sets are given in Table 1.",

        "The possibility of an automatic evaluation of the LU accuracy and the ability of the scoring tool to point out the errors allowed us to easily improve the literal understanding accuracy from 89.0% to 93.5%.",

        "The proposed methodology is based on",
        "Table 1: Literal understanding (LU) accuracy on both exact and ASR transcription, and contextual understanding (CU) accuracy.",
        "Second column indicates the number of units included in the test set (i.e # of user utterances), third column gives the total number of attributes in the correct AVR test sets.",
        "Details, using specific operators, are given for argument (topic) and modifier identification for LU on exact transcription, and for anaphoric reference and ellipsis resolution for CU.",
        "Last column gives the 95% precision of the accuracy estimation (Montacie and Chollet, 1997) semi-automatically built reference test sets, and therefore is much more time effective than manual evaluation.",
        "Furthermore, it provides reproducible tests.",
        "Although the semantic representation is task dependent, the example described above shows the feasibility of the paradigm for any dialog system interfacing to a database.",
        "Robustness to many linguistic phenomena such as repetitions, hesitations or auto-corrections may be evaluated with this method.",
        "XML coding will facilitate the gener-icity and the reusability of the test sets, by allowing the selection of the dialogic contexts to be studied.",
        "The representation of the dialog context with a single paraphrase, derived from a \"flat\" structured AVR, may have some limitations in case of longtime dialog dependencies.",
        "It does not allow for memorizing all the steps of the dialog.",
        "For example, if the speaker says first \"I would like a 2 star hotel\", then \"no I prefer 3 stars\" and finally says \"give me again my first choice\", the CU unit cannot take into account this succession of queries.",
        "However, this kind of interaction is rarely observed in dialogue corpora: the user usually repeats the constraint value (\"give me again a 2 star hotel\").",
        "To represent more precisely the dialog state, the representation of the dialog context should incorporate some meta-information inspired for example from the DAMSL annotation standard (Devillers et al., 2002b).",

        "Assessing the dialog system understanding capabilities requires to evaluate the transition between successive states of the dialog.",
        "At least, we must be able to test a sequence of two states at any point in the dialog.",
        "The dynamic and interactive nature of the dialog makes construction and reuse of test sets difficult.",
        "Furthermore, to evaluate one particular dialog transition, the system has to be put in a particular state corresponding to the original dialog context.",
        "The variable describing the dialog state can be composed of complex information such as the current semantic frame (list of triplets (mode,attribute,value) or quadruples (mode, attribute, value, reference)), the dialog history semantic frame and potentially other information like recognition scores, dialog acts, etc.",
        "The PEACE paradigm allows the evaluation of two successive simplified dialog states.",
        "It has been successfully tested with test samples focusing on linguistic difficulties of literal and contextual understanding.",
        "For these tests, the dialog state is the dialog history semantic frame.",
        "The contextual understanding modeling in PEACE is system independent since the context is given by a paraphrase of queries.",
        "PEACE allows a diagnostic evaluation of specific semantic attributes and particular linguistic phenomena.",
        "In our opinion, it is crucial for the dialog community to agree on a common reference task and reference test sets in order to be able to compare and diagnose dialog systems.",
        "Both evaluation with real users and artificial simulation of successive dialog states using test sets extracted from real corpora have to be carried out in parallel.",
        "The use of test sets reduces the global cost of dialog system evaluation, moreover such tests are reproducible.",
        "The PEACE protocol will be used as basis for the French Technolangue MEDIA project in a two year evaluation campaign where dialog systems from both academia and industry will be evaluated.",
        "In other domains, it could be related with (Hirschman, 2000) propositions for Question Answering evaluation."
