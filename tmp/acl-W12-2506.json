        "Function words are an important feature set for Authorship Attribution (hereafter ?AA?)",
        "because they are considered topic-independent or context-free, and that they are largely used in an unconscious manner (Holmes, 1994; Stamatatos, 2009; Koppel et al., 2009).",
        "The Federalist Papers (Mostellar and Wallace, 1964) may be the most famous example of AA in English.",
        "Mostellar and Wallace (1964) conducted a detailed study of searching and testing function words to distinguish Hamilton and Madison as the authors of the disputed Federalist Papers.",
        "Although Function Word based Authorship Attribution (hereafter ?FWAA?)",
        "has been successful in many studies (Stamatatos, 2009), Juola (2008) argued that FWAA are mainly applied in English texts, and it may not be appropriate for other highly inflected languages, like Finnish and Turkish.",
        "This may not be the case in that it is the content words, not the function words, that are inflected in those languages.",
        "However, function words are indeed rarely used for AA in non-English texts.",
        "It was left out in the comprehensive authorship analysis of The Quiet Don (in Russian) by Kjetsaa et al. (1984).",
        "The literature review for this study found several examples of FWAA in Modern Greek (Mikros and Argiri, 2003) and Arabic (Abbasi and Chen, 2005).",
        "Overall, the effectiveness of FWAA has not been tested on many languages.",
        "Some studies on FWAA also reported negative results.",
        "Holmes (1994), in his comprehensive survey on authorship attribution, cited doubts given by (Damerau, 1975) and (Oakman, 1980), and called for further investigation on the stability of function word use within an author's work and between works by the same author.",
        "Another problem for FWAA is to explain exactly what authorial characteristics are captured by function words, since function words may also characterize other textual properties like genre, author gender, and even topic, although function words are generally considered topic-independent or context-free (Stamatatos, 2009; Herring and Paolillo, 2006; Clement and Sharp 2003; Mikros and Argiri, 2007).",
        "Clement and Sharp (2003) found that function words worked as well as content words in identifying document topics.",
        "Their further investigation showed that author and topic are not arbitrarily orthogonal to each other.",
        "Using the significance level of two-way ANOVA test as measure, Mikros and Argiri (2007) found that some function words in Modern Greek can distinguish both topic and author, providing further evidence for possible topic-author correlation based on function word dimensions.",
        "Function words are also used as indicators for author gender (Argamon et al., 2002; Koppel et al., 2003) and text genre (Biber, 1993).",
        "Koppel et al. (2003) found gender preference on certain personal",
        "pronouns and prepositions.",
        "Herring and Paolillo (2006) repeated Argamon and Koppel's experiment by mixing genre and gender in the data set, and discovered that the same gender indicators actually captured genre characteristics.",
        "In summary, related work has shown that function words may contribute to distinguishing topic, authorship, author gender, and genre.",
        "A question soon emerges: which dimension do function words characterize the most saliently?",
        "In other words, given a document set of mixed author, topic, and genre, would they interfere with each other in classification tasks?",
        "Answer to this question would help guide experiment design for AA tasks, and explain the real authorial characteristics captured by function words.",
        "This paper aims to study the use of function words for Chinese authorship attribution (C-FWAA), since FWAA has not been well-studied in Chinese.",
        "Existing studies of C-FWAA are limited to the analysis of famous authorship dispute cases like whether Gao E or Cao Xueqin wrote the last 40 chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber, and no consensus was reached among these C-FWAA studies (Zeng and Zhu, 2006).",
        "Therefore no baseline was available yet for general-purpose C-FWAA studies.",
        "This study consists of three tasks.",
        "First, examine the effectiveness of C-FWAA in three genres of creative writing: novel, essay, and blog.",
        "Second, compare the strength of function words as both genre and authorship indicators, and explore the genre interference on C-FWAA.",
        "Third, examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive to the time periods when the texts were written.",
        "The third task is proposed for a unique reason that the influence of ancient Chinese (???)",
        "on modern Chinese (??? )",
        "may affect function word use.",
        "For example, ?also?",
        "corresponds to ???",
        "in ancient Chinese, and ???",
        "in modern Chinese.",
        "???",
        "(??s?",
        "or ?of?",

        "(?-ly?",
        "), and ???",
        "(?so?)",
        "are only used in modern Chinese.",
        "The government of Republic of China (RoC, 1912-1949) and the government of People's Republic of China (PRC, 1949- ) both made changes to the Chinese language.",
        "Hence the hypothesis is that Chinese function word use may also reflect the time period of literary works."

        "When the data set mixed authors and genres, these two factors may interfere with each other, and in such cases it depends on the data set which factor do function words characterize more saliently.",
        "Third, this study examined the hypothesized relationship between time period and",
        "Chinese function word use in novels and essays between 1930s and 2000s, but did not find evidence to support this hypothesis.",
        "This study has several limitations that need to be improved in future work.",
        "First, the data set is small and not quite balanced.",
        "More authors and works will be added in the future.",
        "Second, the random seed for EM is set to the default value 100 in Weka.",
        "However, EM clustering result may vary to some extent with different random seeds.",
        "More rigorous design is needed for robust performance comparison.",
        "One design is to run each clustering experiment multiple times, each time with a different random seed.",
        "The clustering accuracy will be averaged over all runs.",
        "This new design will allow for performance comparison based on paired-sample t-test significance.",
        "Third, the Cultural Revolution time period is excluded from this study due to strong political influence on writers.",
        "One reviewer pointed out that this time period should be valuable for examining the relationship between authorship, genre, and time period.",
        "Relevant data will be collected in future study."
