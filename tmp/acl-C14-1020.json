        "This paper presents an empirical study on using syntactic and semantic information for Concept Segmentation and Labeling (CSL), a well-known component in spoken language understanding.",
        "Our approach is based on reranking N -best outputs from a state-of-the-art CSL parser.",
        "We perform extensive experimentation by comparing different tree-based kernels with a variety of representations of the available linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS tags, shallow and full syntax, and discourse trees.",
        "The results show that the structured representation with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser, much larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation.",
        "We also show that shallow syntax helps improve the results and that discourse relations can be partially beneficial."

        "Spoken Language Understanding aims to interpret user utterances and to convert them to logical forms, or, equivalently, database queries, which can then be used to satisfy the user's information needs.",
        "This process is known as Concept Segmentation and Labeling (CSL): it maps utterances into meaning representations based on semantic constituents.",
        "The latter are basically sequences of semantic entities, often referred to as concepts, attributes or semantic tags.",
        "Traditionally, grammar-based methods have been used for CSL, but more recently machine learning approaches to semantic structure computation have been shown to yield higher accuracy.",
        "However, most previous work did not exploit syntactic/semantic structures of the utterances, and the state-of-the-art is represented by conditional models for sequence la-beling, such as Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) trained with simple morphological and lexical features.",
        "In our study, we measure the impact of syntactic and discourse structures by also combining them with innovative features.",
        "In the following subsections, we present the application context for our CSL task and then we outline the challenges and the findings of our research.",
        "1.1 Semantic parsing for the ?restaurant?",
        "domain We experiment with the dataset of McGraw et al. (2012), containing spoken and typed questions about restaurants, which are to be answered using a database of free text such as reviews, categorical data such as names and locations, and semi-categorical data such as user-reported cuisines and amenities.",
        "Semantic parsing, in the form of sequential segmentation and labeling, makes it easy to convert spoken and typed questions such as ?cheap lebanese restaurants in doha with take out?",
        "into database queries.",
        "First, a language-specific semantic parser tokenizes, segments and labels the question: [ Price cheap] [ Cuisine lebanese] [ Other restaurants in] [ City doha] [ Other with] [ Amenity take out] Then, label-specific normalizers are applied to the segments, with the option to possibly relabel mis-labeled segments; at this point, discourse history may be incorporated as well.",
        "[ Price low] [ Cuisine lebanese] [ City doha] [ Amenity carry out] ?",
        "193 Finally, a database query is formed from the list of labels and values, and is then executed against the database, e.g., MongoDB; a backoff mechanism may be used if the query does not succeed.",
        "{$and [{cuisine:\"lebanese\"}, {city:\"doha\"}, {price:\"low\"}, {amenity:\"carry out\"}]} 1.2 Related work on CSL Pieraccini et al. (1991) used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for CSL, where the observations were word sequences and the hidden states were meaning units, i.e, concepts.",
        "In subsequent work (Rubinstein and Hastie, 1997; Santaf?e et al., 2007; Raymond and Riccardi, 2007; De Mori et al., 2008), other generative models were applied, which model the joint probability of a word sequence and a concept sequence, as well as discriminative models, which directly model a conditional probability over the concepts in the input text.",
        "Seneff (1989) and Miller et al. (1994) used stochastic grammars for CSL.",
        "In particular, they applied stochastic Finite State Transducers (FST) for recognizing constituent annotations.",
        "FSTs describe local syntactic structures with a sequence of words, e.g., noun phrases or even constituents.",
        "Papineni et al. (1998) proposed and evaluated exponential models, but, nowadays, Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are considered to be the state-of-the-art.",
        "More recently, Wang et al. (2009) illustrated an approach for CSL that is specific to query understanding for web applications.",
        "A general survey of CSL approaches can be found in (De Mori et al., 2008).",
        "CSL is also connected to a large body of work on shallow semantic parsing; see (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; M`arquez et al., 2008) for an overview.",
        "Another relevant line of research with a considerable body of work is reranking in NLP.",
        "Tree kernels for reranking syntactic parse trees were first proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).",
        "Some variants used explicit spaces (Kudo et al., 2005), and feature vector approaches were proposed in (Koo and Collins, 2005).",
        "Other reranking work using tree kernels regards predicate argument structures (Moschitti et al., 2006) and named entities (Nguyen and Moschitti, 2012).",
        "In (Dinarelli et al., 2011), we rerank CSL hypotheses using structures built on top of concepts, words and features that are simpler than those studied in this paper.",
        "The work of Ge and Mooney (2006) and Kate and Mooney (2006) is also similar to ours, as it models the extraction of semantics as a reranking task using string kernels.",
        "1.3 Syntactic and semantic structures for CSL The related work has highlighted that automatic CSL is mostly based on powerful machine learning algorithms and simple feature representations based on word and tag n-grams.",
        "In this paper, we study the impact of more advanced linguistic processing on CSL, such as shallow and full syntactic parsing and discourse structure.",
        "We use a reranking approach to select the best hypothesis annotated with concepts derived by a local model, where the hypotheses are represented as trees enriched with semantic concepts similarly to (Dinarelli et al., 2011).",
        "These tree-based structures can capture dependencies between sentence constituents and concepts.",
        "However, extracting features from them is rather difficult as their number is exponentially large.",
        "Thus, we rely on structural kernels (e.g., see (Moschitti, 2006)) for automatically encoding tree fragments, which represent syntactic and semantic dependencies from words and concepts, and we train the reranking functions with Support Vector Machines (e.g., see (Joachims, 1999)).",
        "Additionally, we experiment with several types of kernels and newly designed feature vectors.",
        "We test our models on the above-mentioned Restaurant domain.",
        "The results show that (i) the basic CRF model, in fact semi-CRF (see below), is very accurate, achieving more than 83% in F 1 -score, which indicates that improving over the semi-CRF approach is very hard; (ii) the upper-bound performance of the reranking approach is very high as well, i.e., the correct annotation is generated in the first 100 hypotheses in 98.72% of the cases; (iii) our feature vectors show improvement only when all feature groups are used together; otherwise, we only observe marginal improvement; (iv) structural kernels yield a 10% relative error reduction from the semi-CRF baseline, which is more than double the feature vector result; (v) syntactic information significantly improves on the best model, but only when using shallow syntax; and finally, (vi) although, discourse structures provide good improvement over the semi-CRF model, they perform lower than shallow syntax (thus, a valuable use of discourse features is still an open problem that we plan to pursue in future work).",
        "194 2 CSL reranking Reranking is based on a list of N annotation hypotheses, which are generated and sorted by probability using local classifiers.",
        "Then a reranker, typically a meta-classifier, tries to select the best hypothesis from the list.",
        "The reranker can exploit global information, and, specifically, the dependencies between the different concepts that are made available by the local model.",
        "We use semi-CRF as our local model since it yields the highest accuracy in CSL (when using a single model), and preference reranking with kernel machines to rerank the N hypotheses generated by the semi-CRF.",
        "2.1 Basic parser using semi-CRF We use a semi-Markov CRF (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), or semi-CRF, a variation of a linear-chain CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001), to produce the N -best list of labeled segment hypotheses that serve as the input to reranking.",
        "In a linear-chain CRF, with a sequence of tokens x and labels y, we approximate p(y|x) as a product of factors of the form p(y i |y i?1 , x), which corresponds to features of the form f j (y i?1 , y i , i, x), where i iterates over the token/label positions.",

        "For each y ?",
        "m , we pick the N best extended paths.",
        "With semi-CRF, we want a labeled segmentation s rather than a sequence of labels.",
        "Each segment s i = (y i , t i , u i ) has a label y i as well as a starting and ending token position for the segment, t i and u i respectively, where u i + 1 = t i+1 .",
        "We approximate p(s|x), with factors of the form p(s i |s i?1 , x), which we simplify to p(y i , u i |y i?1 , t i ), so features take the form f j (y i?1 , y i , t i , u i ), i.e., they can use the previous segment's label and the current segment's label and endpoints.",
        "The Viterbi search is extended to search for a pair of label and segment end.",
        "Whereas for M labels we kept track of MN paths, we must keep track of MLN paths, where L is the maximum segment length.",
        "We use token n-gram features relative to the segment boundaries, n-grams within the segment, token regular expression and lexicon features within a segment.",
        "Each of these features also includes the labels of the previous and current segment, and the segment length.",
        "2.2 Preference reranking with kernel machines Preference reranking (PR) uses a classifier C of pairs of hypotheses ?H i , H j ?, which decides if H i is better thanH j .",
        "Given each training question Q, positive and negative examples are generated for training the classifier.",
        "We adopt the following approach for example generation: the pairs ?H 1 , H i ?",
        "constitute positive examples, where H 1 has the lowest error rate with respect to the gold standard among the hypotheses for Q, and vice versa, ?H i , H 1 ?",

        "Also, the classifier score can be used as a weighted vote.",

        "One interesting aspect is that these kernels correspond to a scalar product in the fragment space, where each substructure is a feature.",
        "Therefore, they can be used in the training and testing algorithms of kernel machines (see Section 2.2).",
        "Below, we briefly describe different types of kernels we tested in our study, which are made available in the SVM-Light-TK toolkit (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "Subtree Kernel (K0) is one of the simplest tree kernels, as it only generates complete subtrees, i.e., tree fragments that, given any arbitrary starting node, necessarily include all its descendants.",
        "Syntactic Tree Kernel (K1), also known as a subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002), maps objects in the space of all possible tree fragments constrained by the rule that the sibling nodes cannot be separated from their parents.",
        "In other words, substructures are composed of atomic building blocks corresponding to nodes, along with all of their direct children.",
        "In the case of a syntactic parse tree, these are complete production rules for the associated parser grammar.",
        "Syntactic Tree Kernel + BOW (K2) extends ST by allowing leaf nodes to be part of the feature space.",
        "The leaves of the trees correspond to words, i.e., we allow bag-of-words (BOW).",
        "Partial Tree Kernel (K3) can be effectively applied to both constituency and dependency parse trees.",
        "It generates all possible connected tree fragments, e.g., sibling nodes can be also separated and be part of different tree fragments.",
        "In other words, a fragment is any possible tree path from whose nodes other tree paths can depart.",
        "Thus, it can generate a very rich feature space.",
        "Sequence Kernel (K4) is the traditional string kernel applied to the words of a sentence.",
        "In our case, we apply it to the sequence of concepts.",
        "3.2 Semantic/syntactic structures As mentioned before, tree kernels allow us to compute structural similarities between two trees without explicitly representing them as feature vectors.",
        "For the CSL task, we experimented with a number of tree representations that incorporate different levels of syntactic and semantic information.",
        "To capture the structural dependencies between the semantic tags, we use a basic tree (Figure 1a) where the words of a sentence are tagged with their semantic tags.",
        "More specifically, the words in the sentence constitute the leaves of the tree, which are in turn connected to the pre-terminals containing the semantic tags in BIO notation (?B?=begin, ?I?=inside, ?O?=outside).",
        "The BIO tags are then generalized in the upper level, and so on.",
        "The basic tree does not include any syntactic information.",
        "196 However, part-of-speech (POS) and phrasal information could be informative for both segmentation and labeling in semantic parsing.",
        "To incorporate this information, we use two extensions of the basic tree: one that includes the POS tags of the words (Figure 1e), and another one that includes both POS tags and syntactic chunks (Figure 1c).",
        "The POS tags are children of the semantic tags, whereas the chunks (i.e., phrasal information) are included as parents of the semantic tags.",
        "We also experiment with full syntactic trees (Figure 1d) to see the impact of deep syntactic information.",
        "The semantic tags are attached to the pre-terminals (i.e., POS tags) in the syntactic tree.",
        "We use the Stanford POS tagger and syntactic parser and the Twitter NLP tool 1 for the shallow trees.",
        "A sentence containing multiple clauses exhibits a coherence structure.",
        "For instance, in our example, the first clause ?along my route tell me the next steak house?",
        "is elaborated by the second clause ?that is within a mile?.",
        "The relations by which clauses in a text are linked are called coherence relations (e.g., Elaboration, Contrast).",
        "Discourse structures capture this coherence structure of text and provide additional semantic information that could be useful for the CSL task (Stede, 2011).",
        "To build the discourse structure of a sentence, we use a state-of-the-art discourse parser (Joty et al., 2012) which generates discourse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory of discourse (Mann and Thompson, 1988), as exemplified in Figure 1b.",
        "Notice that a text span linked by a coherence relation can be either a nucleus (i.e., the core part) or a satellite (i.e., a supportive one) depending on how central the claim is.",
        "3.3 New features In order to compare to the structured representation, we also devoted significant effort towards engineering a set of features to be used in a flat feature-vector representation; they can be used in isolation or in combination with the kernel-based approach (as a composite kernel using a linear combination): CRF-based: these include the basic features used to train the initial semi-CRF model (cf.",
        "Section 2.1).",
        "n-gram based: we collected 3- and 4-grams of the output label sequence at the level of concepts, with artificial tags inserted to identify the start (?S?)",
        "and end (?E?)",
        "of the sequence.",
        "2 Probability-based: two features computing the probability of the label sequence as an average of the probabilities at the word level p(l i |w i ) (i.e., assuming independence between words).",
        "The unigram probabilities are estimated by frequency counts using maximum likelihood in two ways: (i) from the complete 100-best list of hypotheses; (ii) from the training set (according to the gold standard annotation).",
        "DB-based: a single feature encoding the number of results returned from the database when constructing a query using the conjunction of all semantic segments in the hypothesis.",
        "Three possible values are considered by using a threshold t: 0 (if the query result is void), 1 (if the number of results is in [1, t]), and 2 (if the number of results is greater than t).",
        "In our case, t is empirically set to 10,000.",
        "4 Experiments The experiments aim at investigating which structures, and thus which linguistic models and combination with other models, are the most appropriate for our reranker.",
        "We first calculate the oracle accuracy in order to compute an upper bound of the reranker.",
        "Then we present experiments with the feature vectors, tree kernels, and representations of linguistic information introduced in the previous sections.",

        "Going down to 10-best only adds 2.5 extra F 1 points absolute, and a 100-best list adds 3.5 F 1 points more to yield a respectable F 1 score of 98.72.",
        "This high result can be explained considering that the size of the complete hypothesis set is smaller than 100 for most questions.",
        "Thus, we can conclude that theN -best lists do include many good options and do offer quite a large space for potential improvement.",
        "We can further observe that going to 5-best lists offers a good balance between the length of the list and the possibility to improve F 1 -score: generally, we do not want too long N -best lists since they slow down computation and also introduce more opportunities to make the wrong choice for a reranker (since there are just more candidates to choose from).",

        "This is probably explained by the fact that user queries are rather short and linguistically not very complex.",
        "We also observed that the upper bound performance for the reranker still leaves large room for improvement.",
