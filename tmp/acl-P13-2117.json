        "Distant supervision has attracted recent interest for training information extraction systems because it does not require any human annotation but rather employs existing knowledge bases to heuristically label a training corpus.",
        "However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples misla-beled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases.",
        "To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features.",
        "We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudo-relevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation.",
        "Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments."

        "A recent approach for training information extraction systems is distant supervision, which exploits existing knowledge bases instead of annotated texts as the source of supervision (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011).",
        "To combat the noisy training data produced by heuristic labeling in distant supervision, researchers (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) exploited multi-instance *This work was done while Le Zhao was at Carnegie Mellon University.",

        "Only a few studies have directly examined the influence of the quality of the training data and attempted to enhance it (Sun et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Takamatsu et al., 2012).",
        "However, their methods are handicapped by the built-in assumption that a sentence does not express a relation unless it mentions two entities which participate in the relation in the knowledge base, leading to false negatives.",
        "aligned",
        "In reality, knowledge bases are often incomplete, giving rise to numerous false negatives in the training data.",
        "We sampled 1834 sentences that contain two entities in the New York Times 2006 corpus and manually evaluated whether they express any of a set of 50 common Freebase1 relations.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, of the 133 (7.3%) sentences that truly express one of these relations, only 32 (1.7%) are covered by Freebase, leaving 101 (5.5%) false negatives.",
        "Even for one of the most complete relations in Freebase, Employee-of (with more than 100,000 entity pairs), 6 out of 27 sentences with the pattern ?PERSON executive of ORGANIZATION?",
        "contain a fact that is not included in Freebase and are thus mislabeled as negative.",
        "These mislabelings dilute the discriminative capability of useful features and confuse the models.",
        "In this paper, we will show how reducing this source of noise can significantly improve the performance of distant supervision.",
        "In fact, our system corrects the relation labels of the above 6 sentences before training the relation extractor.",
        "(1) matches relation instances to sentences and (2) learns a passage retrieval model to (3) provide relevance feedback on sentences; Relevant sentences (4) yield new relation instances which are added to the knowledge base; Finally, instances are again (5) matched to sentences to (6) create training data",
        "for relation extraction.",
        "Encouraged by the recent success of simple methods for coreference resolution (Raghunathan et al., 2010) and inspired by pseudo-relevance feedback (Xu and Croft, 1996; Lavrenko and Croft, 2001; Matveeva et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2008) in the field of information retrieval, which expands or reformulates query terms based on the highest ranked documents of an initial query, we propose to increase the quality and quantity of training data generated by distant supervision for information extraction task using pseudo feedback.",
        "As shown in Figure 2, we expand an original knowledge base with possibly missing relation instances with information from the highest ranked sentences returned by a passage retrieval model (Xu et al., 2011) trained on the same data.",
        "We use coarse features for our passage retrieval model to aggressively expand the knowledge base for maximum recall; at the same time, we exploit a multi-instance learning model with fine features for relation extraction to handle the newly introduced false positives and maintain high precision.",
        "Similar to iterative bootstrapping techniques (Yangarber, 2001), this mechanism uses the outputs of the first trained model to expand training data for the second model, but unlike bootstrapping it does not require iteration and avoids the problem of semantic drift.",
        "We further note that iterative bootstrapping over a single distant supervision system is difficult, because state-of-the-art systems (Surdeanu et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2010; Mintz et al., 2009), detect only few false negatives in the training data due to their high-precision low-recall features, which were originally proposed by Mintz et al. (2009).",
        "We present a reliable and novel way to address these issues and achieve significant improvement over the MULTIR system (Hoffmann et al., 2011), increasing recall from 47.7% to 61.2% at comparable precision.",
        "The key to this success is the combination of two different views as in co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998): an information extraction technique with fine features for high precision and an information retrieval technique with coarse features for high recall.",
        "Our work is developed in parallel with Min et al. (2013), who take a very different approach by adding additional latent variables to a multi-instance multi-label model (Surdeanu et al., 2012) to solve this same problem."
