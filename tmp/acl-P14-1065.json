        "From its foundations, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) had two defining characteristics: first, translation was modeled as a generative process at the sentence-level.",
        "Second, it was purely statistical over words or word sequences and made little to no use of linguistic information.",
        "Although modern SMT systems have switched to a discriminative log-linear framework, which allows for additional sources as features, it is generally hard to incorporate dependencies beyond a small window of adjacent words, thus making it difficult to use linguistically-rich models.",
        "Recently, there have been two promising research directions for improving SMT and its eval-uation: (a) by using more structured linguistic information, such as syntax (Galley et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2005), hierarchical structures (Chi- ang, 2005), and semantic roles (Wu and Fung, 2009; Lo et al., 2012), and (b) by going beyond the sentence-level, e.g., translating at the document level (Hardmeier et al., 2012).",
        "Going beyond the sentence-level is important since sentences rarely stand on their own in a well-written text.",
        "Rather, each sentence follows smoothly from the ones before it, and leads into the ones that come afterwards.",
        "The logical relationship between sentences carries important information that allows the text to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its separate parts.",
        "Note that sentences can be made of several clauses, which in turn can be interrelated through the same logical relations.",
        "Thus, in a coherent text, discourse units (sentences or clauses) are logically connected: the meaning of a unit relates to that of the previous and the following units.",
        "Discourse analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure underneath the text.",
        "Several formal theories of discourse have been proposed to describe the coherence structure (Mann and Thomp-son, 1988; Asher and Lascarides, 2003; Webber, 2004).",
        "For example, the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), or RST, represents text by labeled hierarchical structures called Discourse Trees (DTs), which can incorporate several layers of other linguistic information, e.g., syntax, predicate-argument structure, etc.",
        "Modeling discourse brings together the above research directions (a) and (b), which makes it an attractive goal for MT.",
        "This is demonstrated by the establishment of a recent workshop dedicated to Discourse in Machine Translation (Webber et al., 2013), collocated with the 2013 annual meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics.",
        "The area of discourse analysis for SMT is still nascent and, to the best of our knowledge, no previous research has attempted to use rhetorical structure for SMT or machine translation evaluation.",
        "One possible reason could be the unavailability of accurate discourse parsers.",
        "However, this situation is likely to change given the most recent advances in automatic discourse analysis (Joty et al., 2012; Joty et al., 2013).",
        "687 We believe that the semantic and pragmatic information captured in the form of DTs (i) can help develop discourse-aware SMT systems that produce coherent translations, and (ii) can yield better MT evaluation metrics.",
        "While in this work we focus on the latter, we think that the former is also within reach, and that SMT systems would benefit from preserving the coherence relations in the source language when generating target-language translations.",
        "In this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored.",
        "We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-available discourse parser (Joty et al., 2012); then, we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "These metrics tasks are based on sentence-level evaluation, which arguably can limit the benefits of using global discourse properties.",
        "Fortunately, several sentences are long and complex enough to present rich discourse structures connecting their basic clauses.",
        "Thus, although limited, this setting is able to demonstrate the potential of discourse-level information for MT evaluation.",
        "Furthermore, sentence-level scoring (i) is compatible with most translation systems, which work on a sentence-by-sentence basis, (ii) could be beneficial to modern MT tuning mechanisms such as PRO (Hop- kins and May, 2011) and MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008), which also work at the sentence-level, and (iii) could be used for re-ranking n-best lists of translation hypotheses.",
        "2 Related Work Addressing discourse-level phenomena in machine translation is relatively new as a research direction.",
        "Some recent work has looked at anaphora resolution (Hardmeier and Federico, 2010) and discourse connectives (Cartoni et al., 2011; Meyer, 2011), to mention two examples.",
        "1 However, so far the attempts to incorporate discourse-related knowledge in MT have been only moderately suc-cessful, at best.",
        "1 We refer the reader to (Hardmeier, 2012) for an in-depth overview of discourse-related research for MT.",
        "A common argument, is that current automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate to capture discourse-related aspects of translation quality (Hardmeier and Federico, 2010; Meyer et al., 2012).",
        "Thus, there is consensus that discourse-informed MT evaluation metrics are needed in order to advance research in this direction.",
        "Here we suggest some simple ways to create such metrics, and we also show that they yield better correlation with human judgments.",
        "The field of automatic evaluation metrics for MT is very active, and new metrics are continuously being proposed, especially in the context of the evaluation campaigns that run as part of the Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2008-2012), and NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge (MetricsMATR), among others.",
        "For example, at WMT12, 12 metrics were compared (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), most of them new.",
        "There have been several attempts to incorporate syntactic and semantic linguistic knowledge into MT evaluation.",
        "For instance, at the syntactic level, we find metrics that measure the structural similarity between shallow syntactic sequences (Gim?enez and M`arquez, 2007; Popovic and Ney, 2007) or between constituency trees (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",
        "In the semantic case, there are metrics that exploit the similarity over named entities and predicate-argument structures (Gim?enez and M`arquez, 2007; Lo et al., 2012).",
        "In this work, instead of proposing a new metric, we focus on enriching current MT evaluation metrics with discourse information.",
        "Our experiments show that many existing metrics can benefit from additional knowledge about discourse structure.",
        "In comparison to the syntactic and semantic extensions of MT metrics, there have been very few attempts to incorporate discourse information so far.",
        "One example are the semantics-aware metrics of Gim?enez and M`arquez (2009) and Comelles et al. (2010), which use the Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and tree-based discourse representation structures (DRS) produced by a semantic parser.",
        "They calculate the similarity between the MT output and references based on DRS subtree matching, as defined in (Liu and Gildea, 2005), DRS lexical overlap, and DRS morpho-syntactic overlap.",
        "However, they could not improve correlation with human judgments, as evaluated on the MetricsMATR dataset.",
        "688 Compared to the previous work, (i) we use a different discourse representation (RST), (ii) we compare discourse parses using all-subtree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001), (iii) we evaluate on much larger datasets, for several language pairs and for multiple metrics, and (iv) we do demonstrate better correlation with human judgments.",
        "Wong and Kit (2012) recently proposed an extension of MT metrics with a measure of document-level lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "Lexical cohesion is achieved using word repetitions and semantically similar words such as synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms.",
        "For BLEU and TER, they observed improved correlation with human judgments on the MTC4 dataset when linearly interpolating these metrics with their lexical cohesion score.",
        "Unlike their work, which measures lexical cohesion at the document-level, here we are concerned with coherence (rhetorical) structure, primarily at the sentence-level.",
        "3 Our Discourse-Based Measures Our working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems.",
        "In particular, we believe that good translations should tend to preserve discourse relations.",
        "As an example, consider the three discourse trees (DTs) shown in Figure 1: (a) for a reference (human) translation, and (b) and (c) for translations of two different systems on the WMT12 test dataset.",
        "The leaves of a DT correspond to contiguous atomic text spans, called Elementary Discourse Units or EDUs (three in Figure 1a).",
        "Adjacent spans are connected by certain coherence relations (e.g., Elaboration, Attribution), forming larger discourse units, which in turn are also subject to this relation linking.",
        "Discourse units linked by a relation are further distinguished based on their relative importance in the text: nuclei are the core parts of the relation while satellites are supportive ones.",
        "Note that the nuclearity and relation labels in the reference translation are also realized in the system translation in (b), but not in (c), which makes (b) a better translation compared to (c), according to our hypothesis.",
        "We argue that existing metrics that only use lexical and syntactic information cannot distinguish well between (b) and (c).",
        "In order to develop a discourse-aware evaluation metric, we first generate discourse trees for the reference and the system-translated sentences using a discourse parser, and then we measure the similarity between the two discourse trees.",
        "We describe these two steps below.",
        "3.1 Generating Discourse Trees In Rhetorical Structure Theory, discourse analysis involves two subtasks: (i) discourse segmentation, or breaking the text into a sequence of EDUs, and (ii) discourse parsing, or the task of linking the units (EDUs and larger discourse units) into labeled discourse trees.",
        "Recently, Joty et al. (2012) proposed discriminative models for both discourse segmentation and discourse parsing at the sentence level.",
        "The segmenter uses a maximum entropy model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, having an F 1 -score of 90.5%, while human agreement is 98.3%.",
        "The discourse parser uses a dynamic Conditional Random Field (Sutton et al., 2007) as a parsing model in order to infer the probability of all possible discourse tree constituents.",
        "The inferred (posterior) probabilities are then used in a probabilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm to find the most likely DT.",
        "Using the standard set of 18 coarse-grained relations defined in (Carlson and Marcu, 2001), the parser achieved an F 1 -score of 79.8%, which is very close to the human agreement of 83%.",
        "These high scores allowed us to develop successful discourse similarity metrics.",
        "2 3.2 Measuring Similarity A number of metrics have been proposed to measure the similarity between two labeled trees, e.g., Tree Edit Distance (Tai, 1979) and Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Moschitti and Basili, 2006).",
        "Tree kernels (TKs) provide an effective way to integrate arbitrary tree structures in kernel-based machine learning algorithms like SVMs.",
        "In the present work, we use the convolution TK defined in (Collins and Duffy, 2001), which efficiently calculates the number of common subtrees in two trees.",
        "Note that this kernel was originally designed for syntactic parsing, where the subtrees are subject to the constraint that their nodes are taken with either all or none of the children.",
        "This constraint of the TK imposes some limitations on the type of substructures that can be compared.",

        "We experiment with TKs applied to two different representations of the discourse tree: non-lexicalized (DR), and lexicalized (DR-LEX).",
        "In Figure 2 we show the two representations for the subtree that spans the text: ?sug- gest the ECB should be the lender of last resort?, which is highlighted in Figure 1b.",
        "As shown in Figure 2a, DR does not include any lexical item, and therefore measures the similarity between two translations in terms of their discourse structures only.",
        "On the contrary, DR-LEX includes the lexical items to account for lexical matching; moreover, it separates the structure (the skeleton) of the tree from its labels, i.e. the nuclearity and the relations, in order to allow the tree kernel to give partial credit to subtrees that differ in labels but match in their skeletons.",
        "More specif-ically, it uses the tags SPAN and EDU to build the skeleton of the tree, and considers the nuclearity and/or the relation labels as properties, added as children, of these tags.",
        "For example, a SPAN has two properties (its nuclearity and its relation), and an EDU has one property (its nuclearity).",
        "The words of an EDU are placed under the predefined children NGRAM.",
        "In order to allow the tree kernel to find subtree matches at the word level, we include an additional layer of dummy leaves as was done in (Moschitti et al., 2007); not shown in Figure 2, for simplicity.",
        "4 Experimental Setup In our experiments, we used the data available for the WMT12 and the WMT11 metrics shared tasks for translations into English.",
        "3 This included the output from the systems that participated in the WMT12 and the WMT11 MT evaluation cam-paigns, both consisting of 3,003 sentences, for four different language pairs: Czech-English (CS- EN), French-English (FR-EN), German-English (DE-EN), and Spanish-English (ES-EN); as well as a dataset with the English references.",
