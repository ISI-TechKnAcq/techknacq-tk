        "One of the main motivations for research on parsing is that syntactic structure provides important information for semantic interpretation; hence syntactic parsing is an important first step in a variety of",
        "useful tasks.",
        "Broad coverage syntactic parsers with good performance have recently become available (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000), but these typically produce as output a parse tree that only encodes local syntactic information, i.e., a tree that does not include any “empty nodes”.",
        "(Collins (1997) discusses the recovery of one kind of empty node, viz., WH-traces).",
        "This paper describes a simple pattern-matching algorithm for post-processing the output of such parsers to add a wide variety of empty nodes to its parse trees.",
        "Empty nodes encode additional information about non-local dependencies between words and phrases which is important for the interpretation of constructions such as WH-questions, relative clauses, etc.1 For example, in the noun phrase the man Sam likes the fact the man is interpreted as the direct object of the verb likes is indicated in Penn treebank notation by empty nodes and coindexation as shown in Figure 1 (see the next section for an explanation of why likes is tagged VB Z _t rather than the standard VB Z).",
        "The broad-coverage statistical parsers just mentioned produce a simpler tree structure for such a relative clause that contains neither of the empty nodes just indicated.",
        "Rather, they produce trees of the kind shown in Figure 2.",
        "Unlike the tree depicted in Figure 1, this type of tree does not explicitly represent the relationship between likes and the man.",
        "This paper presents an algorithm that takes as its input a tree without empty nodes of the kind shown",
        "in Figure 2 and modifies it by inserting empty nodes and coindexation to produce a the tree shown in Figure 1.",
        "The algorithm is described in detail in section 2.",
        "The standard Parseval precision and recall measures for evaluating parse accuracy do not measure the accuracy of empty node and antecedent recovery, but there is a fairly straightforward extension of them that can evaluate empty node and antecedent recovery, as described in section 3.",
        "The rest of this section provides a brief introduction to empty nodes, especially as they are used in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Non-local dependencies and displacement phenomena, such as Passive and WH-movement, have been a central topic of generative linguistics since its inception half a century ago.",
        "However, current linguistic research focuses on explaining the possible non-local dependencies, and has little to say about how likely different kinds of dependencies are.",
        "Many current linguistic theories of non-local dependencies are extremely complex, and would be difficult to apply with the kind of broad coverage described here.",
        "Psycholinguists have also investigated certain kinds of non-local dependencies, and their theories of parsing preferences might serve as the basis for specialized algorithms for recovering certain kinds of non-local dependencies, such as WH dependencies.",
        "All of these approaches require considerably more specialized linguitic knowledge than the pattern-matching algorithm described here.",
        "This algorithm is both simple and general, and can serve as a benchmark against which more complex approaches can be evaluated.",
        "The pattern-matching approach is not tied to any particular linguistic theory, but it does require a treebank training corpus from which the algorithm extracts its patterns.",
        "We used sections 2–21 of the Penn Treebank as the training corpus; section 24 was used as the development corpus for experimentation and tuning, while the test corpus (section 23) was used exactly once (to obtain the results in section 3).",
        "Chapter 4 of the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) contains an extensive description of the kinds of empty nodes and the use of co-indexation in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Table 1 contains summary statistics on the distribution of empty nodes in the Penn Treebank.",
        "The entry with POS SBAR and no label refers to a “compound” type of empty structure labelled SBAR consisting of an empty complementizer and an empty (moved) S (thus SBAR is really a nonterminal label rather than a part of speech); a typical example is shown in Figure 3.",
        "As might be expected the distribution is highly skewed, with most of the empty node tokens belonging to just a few types.",
        "Because of this, a system can provide good average performance on all empty nodes if it performs well on the most frequent types of empty nodes, and conversely, a system will perform poorly on average if it does not perform at least moderately well on the most common types of empty nodes, irrespective of how well it performs on more esoteric constructions.",

        "The “label” column gives the terminal label of the empty node, the “POS” column gives its preterminal label and the “Antecedent” column gives the label of its antecedent.",
        "The entry with an SBAR POS and empty label corresponds to an empty compound SBAR subtree, as explained in the text and Figure 3.",
        "be regarded as an instance of the Memory-Based Learning approach, where both the pattern extraction and pattern matching involve recursively visiting all of the subtrees of the tree concerned.",
        "It can also be regarded as a kind of tree transformation, so the overall system architecture (including the parser) is an instance of the “transform-detransform” approach advocated by Johnson (1998).",
        "The algorithm has two phases.",
        "The first phase of the algorithm extracts the patterns from the trees in the training corpus.",
        "The second phase of the algorithm uses these extracted patterns to insert empty nodes and index their antecedents in trees that do not contain empty nodes.",
        "Before the trees are used in the training and insertion phases they are passed through a common preproccessing step, which relabels preterminal nodes dominating auxiliary verbs and transitive verbs."

        "Note that the use of a pre-order traversal effectively biases the procedure toward “deeper”, more embedded patterns.",
        "Since empty nodes are typically located in the most embedded local trees of patterns (i.e., movement is usually “upward” in a tree), if two different patterns (corresponding to different non-local dependencies) could potentially insert empty nodes into the same tree fragment in t, the deeper pattern will match at a higher node in t, and hence will be substituted.",

        "This paper described a simple pattern-matching algorithm for restoring empty nodes in parse trees that do not contain them, and appropriately indexing these nodes with their antecedents.",
        "The pattern-matching algorithm combines both simplicity and reasonable performance over the frequently occuring types of empty nodes.",
        "Performance drops considerably when using trees produced by the parser, even though this parser’s precision and recall is around 0.9.",
        "Presumably this is because the pattern matching technique requires that the parser correctly identify large tree fragments that encode long-range dependencies not captured by the parser.",
        "If the parser makes a single parsing error anywhere in the tree fragment matched by a pattern, the pattern will no longer match.",
        "This is not unlikely since the statistical model used by the parser does not model these larger tree fragments.",
        "It suggests that one might improve performance by integrating parsing, empty node recovery and antecedent finding in a single system, in which case the current algorithm might serve as a useful baseline.",
        "Alternatively, one might try to design a “sloppy” pattern matching algorithm which in effect recognizes and corrects common parser errors in these constructions.",
        "Also, it is undoubtedly possible to build programs that can do better than this algorithm on special cases.",
        "For example, we constructed a Boosting classifier which does recover *U* and empty complementizers 0 more accurately than the pattern-matcher described here (although the pattern-matching algorithm does quite well on these constructions), but this classifier’s performance averaged over all empty node types was approximately the same as the pattern-matching algorithm.",
        "As a comparison of tables 3 and 4 shows, the pattern-matching algorithm’s biggest weakness is its inability to correctly distinguish co-indexed NP * (i.e., NP PRO) from free (i.e., unindexed) NP *.",
        "This seems to be a hard problem, and lexical information (especially the class of the governing verb) seems relevant.",
        "We experimented with specialized classifiers for determining if an NP * is co-indexed, but they did not perform much better than the algorithm presented here.",
        "(Also, while we did not systematically investigate this, there seems to be a number of errors in the annotation of free vs. co-indexed NP *in the treebank).",

        "We experimented with lexicalizing patterns, but the simple method we tried did not improve results.",
        "Inspired by results suggesting that the pattern-matching algorithm suffers from over-learning (e.g., testing on the training corpus), we experimented with more abstract “skeletal” patterns, which improved performance on some types of empty nodes but hurt performance on others, leaving overall performance approximately unchanged.",
