        "Therefore, it is necessary to generate a set of candidate segmentations and select between them according to the MDL principle.",

        "The goal of unsupervised word segmentation is to discover correct word boundaries in natural language corpora where explicit boundaries are absent.",
        "Often, unsupervised word segmentation algorithms rely heavily on parameterization to produce the correct segmentation for a given language.",
        "The goal of fully unsupervised word segmentation, then, is to recover the correct boundaries for arbitrary natural language corpora without explicit human parameterization.",
        "This means that a fully unsupervised algorithm would have to set its own parameters based only on the corpus provided to it.",
        "In principle, this goal can be achieved by creating a function that measures the quality of a segmentation in a language-independent way, and applying this function to all possible segmentations of the corpora to select the best one.",
        "Evidence from the word segmentation literature suggests that description length provides a good approximation to this segmentation quality function.",
        "We discuss the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle in more detail in the next section.",
        "Unfortunately, evaluating all possible segmentations is intractable, since a corpus of length n has 2n-1 possible segmentations.",
        "As a result, MDL methods have to rely on an efficient algorithm to generate a relatively small number of candidate segmentations to choose between.",
        "It is an empirical question which algorithm will generate the most effective set of candidate segmentations.",
        "In this work, we compare a variety of unsupervised word segmentation algorithms operating in conjunction with MDL for fully unsupervised segmentation, and find that the Bootstrapped Voting Experts (BVE) algorithm generally achieves the best performance."

        "At a formal level, a segmentation algorithm is a function Segment(c, 6) that maps a corpus c and a vector of parameters 6 g 6 to one of the possible segmentations of that corpus.",
        "The goal of fully unsupervised segmentation is to reduce Segment(c, 6) to Segment(c) by removing the need for a human to specify a particular 6.",
        "One way to achieve this goal is to generate a set of candidate segmentations by evaluating the algorithm for multiple values of 6, and then choose the segmentation that minimizes some cost function.",
        "Thus, we can define Segment(c) in terms of Segment(c, 6):",
        "Segment(c) = argmin CostSegmentc,",
        "Now, selecting the best segmentation is treated as a model selection problem, where each segmentation provides a different model of the corpus.",
        "Intuitively, a general approach is to choose the simplest model that explains the data, a principle known as Occam's Razor.",
        "In information theory, this intuitive principle of simplicity or parsimony has been formalized as the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which states that the most likely model of the data is the one that requires the fewest bits to encode (Rissanen, 1983).",
        "The number of bits required to represent a model is called its description length.",
        "Previous work applying the MDL principle to segmentation (Yu, 2000; Argamon et al., 2004; Zhikov et al., 2010) is motivated by the observation that every segmentation of a corpus implicitly defines a lexicon, or set of words.",
        "More formally, the segmented corpus S is a list of words s1s2 ... sN.",
        "L(S), the lexicon implicitly defined by S, is simply the set of unique words in S. The description length of S can then be broken into two components, the description length of the lexicon and the description length of the corpus given the lexicon.",
        "If we consider S as being generated by sampling words from a probability distribution over words in the lexicon, the number of bits required to represent each word si in S is simply its surprisal, – log P(si).",
        "The information cost of the corpus given the lexicon is then computed by summing the surprisal of each word si in the corpus:",
        "To properly compute the description length of the segmentation, we must also include the cost of the lexicon.",
        "Adding in the description length of the lexicon forces a trade-off between the lexicon size and the size of the compressed corpus.",
        "For purposes of the description length calculation, the lexicon is simply treated as a separate corpus consisting of characters rather than words.",
        "The description length can then be computed in the usual manner, by summing the surprisal of each character in each word in the lexicon:",
        "where k g w refers to the characters in word w in the lexicon.",
        "As noted by Zhikov et al.",
        "(Zhikov et al., 2010), an additional term is needed for the information required to encode the parameters ofthe lexicon model.",
        "This quantity is normally estimated by (k/2) log n, where k is the degrees of freedom in the model and n is the length of the data (Rissanen, 1983).",
        "Substituting the appropriate values for the lexicon model yields:",
        "The full description length calculation is simply the sum of three terms shown in 2, 3, and 4.",
        "From this definition, it follows that a low description length will be achieved by a segmentation that defines a small lexicon, which nonetheless reduces the corpus to a short series of mostly high-frequency words."

        "By \"unsupervised,\" we mean operating on a single unbroken sequence of characters without any boundary information; Excluded from consideration are a class of algorithms that are semi-supervised because they require sentence boundaries to be provided.",

        "PtM posits a boundary whenever the increase in the branching entropy exceeds a threshold.",
        "This threshold provides an adjustable parameter for PtM, which we exploit to generate 41 candidate segmentations by trying every threshold in the range [0.0, 2.0], in steps of 0.05.",
        "The Voting Experts (VE) algorithm (Cohen and Adams, 2001) is based on the premise that words may be identified by an information theoretic signature: Entropy within a word is relatively low, entropy at word boundaries is relatively high.",
        "The name Voting Experts refers to the \"experts\" that vote on possible boundary locations.",
        "VE has two experts: One votes to place boundaries after sequences that have low internal entropy (surprisal), given by Hj(seq) = – logP(seq), the other votes after sequences that have high branching entropy.",
        "All sequences are evaluated locally, within a sliding window, so the algorithm is very efficient.",
        "A boundary is generated whenever the vote total at a given location exceeds a threshold, and in some cases only if the vote total is a local maximum.",
        "VE thus has three parameters that can be manipulated to generate potential segmentations: Window size, threshold, and local maximum.",
        "Pairing VE with MDL was first examined by Hewlett and Cohen (2009).",
        "We generated a set of 104 segmentations by trying every viable threshold and local max setting for each window size between 2 and 9.",
        "The Bootstrapped Voting Experts (BVE) algorithm (Hewlett and Cohen, 2009) is an extension to VE.",
        "BVE works by segmenting the corpus repeatedly, with each new segmentation incorporating knowledge gained from previous segmentations.",
        "As with many bootstrapping methods, three essential components are required: some initial seed knowledge, a way to represent knowledge, and a way to leverage that knowledge to improve future performance.",
        "For BVE, the seed knowledge consists of a high-precision segmentation generated by VE.",
        "After this seed segmentation, BVE segments the corpus repeatedly, lowering the vote threshold with each iteration.",
        "Knowledge gained from prior segmentations is represented in a data structure called the knowledge trie.",
        "During voting, this knowledge trie provides statistics for a third expert that places votes in contexts where boundaries were most frequently observed during the previous iteration.",
        "Each iteration of BVE provides a candidate segmentation, and executing BVE for window sizes 2-8 and both local max settings generated a total of 126 segmentations."

        "We have shown that the combination of BVE and MDL provides an effective approach to unsupervised word segmentation, and that it can equal or surpass semi-supervised algorithms such as MBDP-1, HDP, and WordEnds in some cases.",

        "One area for future work is a full investigation of the performance of these algorithms in polysynthetic languages such as Inukti-tut, where each word contains many morphemes.",
        "It is likely that in such languages, the algorithms will find morphs rather than words."
