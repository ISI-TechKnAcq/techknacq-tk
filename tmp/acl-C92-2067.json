        "(4).",
        "In a parameterized system, if a quantified cost function is provided, it can be used directly for parameter tuning.",
        "Thus, a systematic and standardized approach for performance evaluation and the establishment of a common testing base arc urgently required.",
        "Most conventional approaches evaluate system performance by human inspection and subjective measures.",
        "While post-editing, the post-editors can provide feedback on the quality of machine translation, which then is used for dictionary update and linguistic analyses of errors [Ross 82J.",
        "Also, feedback can be obtained from professional translators who annotate carefully on the printouts of raw translation output [Pigo 82].",
        "From human feedback, system designers tend to overtune the system.",
        "Another approach, proposed in [King 90], is to collect the test suites and divide them into two sections: one to look at source language coverage, the other to examine translational problems.",
        "Such an approach can avoid tile over-tuning problem caused by human feedback.",
        "The advantage of human inspection is that humans can pinpoint the real linguistic problems and make corrections.",
        "However, there are several disadvantages: (1).",
        "It is too costly for human inspection of the translation output quality.",
        "'lb get significant statistics on the real system performance, a large volume of text must be provided.",
        "The cost for human inspection is thus extremely high.",
        "(2).",
        "It will take too long for the results to come out.",
        "For this reason and the cost consideration, it can not be repeated frequently.",
        "Therefore, it can not provide a quick suggestion to a system designer when the system is changed or when the domain is alerted.",
        "For a system that must handle a wide variety of types of text, it fails to provide immediate help to adapt to the particular domain or field.",
        "(3).",

        "Even for the same person, it is very likely that he/she would judge a translation result differently at different time, especially when the evaluation criteria am loosely defined.",

        "The test points are coded in programs, therefore the testing can be done automatically.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that since their criteria are purely linguistic, they can do a very delicate evaluation and find the real linguistics problems involved.",

        "Corpus collecting and test points selecting are very time-consuming.",

        "According to our experience on providing translation services with the ArchTran MTS, for most translation materials, even for manuals or announcement, the final versions are intended for publication, not just for information retrieval.",
