        "Language tools are applications that support linguistic research and processing of various language computational layers.",
        "These include lexical units, to syntax and semantics.",
        "Specifically, we have worked on the morphological processes, part of speech tagging and parsing.",
        "These processes usually employ either the rule-based approach or the example-based approach.",
        "In general, rule-based approaches capture language processes by formally capturing these processes which would require consultations and inputs from linguists.",
        "On the other hand, example-based approaches employ machine learning methodologies where automatic learning of rules is performed based on manually annotated data that are done also by linguists.",
        "We have tested both rule-based and example-based approaches in developing our morphological analyzers and generators.",
        "Rule-based morphological analysis in the current methods, such as finite-state and unification-based, are predominantly effective for handling concatenative morphology (e.g. prefixation and suffixation), although some of these techniques can also handle limited non-concatenative phenomena (e.g. infixation and partial and full-stem reduplication) which are largely used in Philippine languages.",
        "TagMA (Fortes-Galvan and Roxas, 2007) uses a constraint-based method to perform morphological analysis that handles both concatenative and non-concatenative morphological phenomena, based on the optimality theory framework and the two-level morphology rule representation.",
        "Test results showed 96% accuracy.",
        "The 4% error is attributed to d-r alteration, an example of which is in the word lakaran, which is from the root word lakad and suffix -an, but d is changed to r. Unfortunately, since all candidates are generated, and erroneous ones are later eliminated through constraints and rules, time efficiency is affected by the exhaustive search performed.",
        "To augment the rule-based approach, an example-based approach was explored by extending Wicentowski's Word Frame model through learning of morphology rules from examples (Cheng and See, 2006).",
        "In the WordFrame model, the seven-way split rewrite rules composed of the canonical prefix/beginning, point-of-prefixation, common prefix substrings, internal vowel change, common suffix substring, point-of-suffixation, and canonical suffix/ending.",
        "Infixation, partial and full reduplication as in Tagalog and other Philippine languages are improperly modeled in the WordFrame model as point-of-prefixation as in the word (hin)-intay which should have been modeled as the word hintay with infix -in-.",
        "Words with an infix within a prefix are also modeled as point-of-prefixation as in the word (hini-)hintay which should be represented as infix in in partial reduplicated syllable hi-.",
        "In the revised WordFrame model (Cheng and See, 2006), the non-concatenative Tagalog morphological behaviors such as infixation and reduplication are modeled separately and correctly.",
        "Unfortunately, it is still not capable of fully modeling Filipino morphology since some occurrences of reduplication are still represented as point-of-suffixation for various locations of the longest common substring.",
        "There are also some problems in handling the occurrence of several partial or whole-word reduplications within a word.",
        "Despite these problems, the training of the algorithm that learns these rewrite rules from 40,276 Filipino word pairs derived 90% accuracy when applied to an MA.",
        "The complexity of creating a better model would be computationally costly but it would ensure an increase in performance and reduced number of rules.",
        "Work is still to be done on exploring techniques and methodologies for morphological generation (MG).",
        "Although it could be inferred that the approaches for MA can be extended to handle MG, an additional disambiguation process is necessary to choose the appropriate output from the many various surface form of words that can be generated from one underlying form.",
        "One of the most useful information in the language corpora are the part of speech tags that are associated with each word in the corpora.",
        "These tags allow applications to perform other syntactic and semantic processes.",
        "Firstly, with the aid of linguists, a revised tagset for Tagalog has been formulated (Miguel and Roxas, 2007), since a close examination of the existing tagset for languages such as English showed the insufficiency of this tagset to handle certain phenomena in Philippine languages such as the lexical markers, ligatures and enclitics.",
        "The lexical marker ay is used in inverted sentences such as She is good (Siya ay mabuti).",
        "Ligatures can take the form of the word na or suffixes -ng (-g), the former is used if the previous noun, pronoun or adjective ends with a consonant (except for n), and the latter if the previous word ends with a vowel (or n).",
        "Manual tagging of corpora has allowed the performance of automatic experiments on some approaches for tagging for Philippine languages namely MBPOST, PTPOST4.1, TPOST and TagAlog, each one exploring on a particular approach in tagging such as memory-based POS, template-based and rule-based approaches.",
        "A study on the performance of these taggers showed accuracies of 85, 73, 65 and 61%, respectively (Miguel and Roxas, 2007).",
        "Grammar checkers are some of the applications where syntactic specification of languages is necessary.",
        "SpellCheF is a spell checker for Filipino that uses a hybrid approach in detecting and correcting misspelled words in a document (Cheng, et al., 2007).",
        "Its approach is composed of dictionary-lookup, n-gram analysis, Soundex and character distance measurements.",

        "Two spelling rules and guidelines, namely, the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino 2001 Revision of the Alphabet and Guidelines in Spelling the Filipino Language, and the Gabay sa Editing sa Wi-kang Filipino rulebooks, were incorporated into the system.",
        "SpellCheF consists of the lexicon builder, the detector, and the corrector; all of which utilized both manually formulated and automatically learned rules to carry out their respective tasks.",
        "FiSSAn, on the other hand, is a semantics-based grammar checker.",
        "Lastly, PanPam (Jasa, et al.",
        ", 2007) is an extension of FiSSAn that also incorporates a dictionary-based spell checker (Borra, et al., 2007).",
        "These systems make use of the rule-based approach.",
        "To complement these systems, an example-based approach is considered through a grammar rule induction method (Alcantara and Borra, 2008).",
        "Constituent structures are automatically induced using unsupervised probabilistic approaches.",
        "Two models are presented and results on the Filipino language show an F1 measure of greater than 69%.",
        "Experiments revealed that the Filipino language does not follow a strict binary structure as English, but is more right-biased.",
        "A similar experiment has been conducted on grammar rule induction for the automatic parsing of the Philippine component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-PHI) (Flores and Roxas, 2008).",

        "The MT engines explore on approaches in translation using a rule-based method and two example-based methods.",
        "The rule-based approach requires the formal specification of the human languages covered in the study and utilizes these rules to translate the input.",
        "The two other MT engines make use of examples to determine the translation.",
        "The example-based MT engines have different approaches in their use of the examples (which are existing English and Filipino documents), as well as the data that they are learning.",
        "The system accepts as input a sentence or a document in the source language and translates this into the target language.",
        "If source language is English, the target language is Filipino, and vise versa.",
        "The input text will undergo preprocessing that will include POS tagging and morphological analysis.",
        "After translation, the output translation will undergo natural language generation including morphological generation.",
        "Since each of the MT engines would not necessarily have the same output translation, an additional component called the Output Modeler was created to determine the most appropriate among the translation outputs (Go and See, 2008).",
        "There are ongoing experiments on the hybridization of the rule-based and the template-based approaches where transfer rules and unification constraints are derived (Fontanilla and Roxas, 2008).",
        "The rule-based MT builds a database of rules for language representation and translation rules from linguists and other experts on translation from English to Filipino and from Filipino to English.",
        "We have considered lexical functional grammar (LFG) as the formalism to capture these rules.",
        "Given a sentence in the source language, the sentence is processed and a computerized representation in LFG of this sentence is constructed.",
        "An evaluation of how comprehensive and exhaustive the identified grammar is will be considered.",
        "Is the system able to capture all possible Filipino sentences?",
        "How are all possible sentences to be represented since Filipino exhibits some form of free word order in sentences?",
        "The next step is the translation step, that is, the conversion of the computerized representation of the input sentence into the intended target language.",
        "After the translation process, the computerized representation of the sentence in the target language will now be outputted into a sentence form, or called the generation process.",
        "Although it has been shown in various studies elsewhere and on various languages that LFG can be used for analysis of sentences, there is still a question of whether it can be used for the generation process.",
        "The generation involves the outputting of a sentence from a computer-based representation of the sentence.",
        "This is part of the work that the group intends to address.",
        "The major advantage of the rule-based MT over other approaches is that it can produce high quality translation for sentence patterns that were accurately captured by the rules of the MT engine; but unfortunately, it cannot provide good translations to any sentence that go beyond what the rules have considered.",
        "In contrast to the rule-based MT which requires building the rules by hand, the corpus-based MT system automatically learns how translation is done through examples found in a corpus of translated documents.",
        "The system can incrementally learn when new translated documents are added into the knowledge-base, thus, any changes to the language can also be accommodated through the updates on the example translations.",
        "This means it can handle translation of documents from various domains (Alcantara, et al., 2006).",
        "The principle of garbage-in-garbage-out applies here; if the example translations are faulty, the learned rules will also be faulty.",
        "That is why, although human linguists do not have to specify and come up with the translation rules, the linguist will have to first verify the translated documents and consequently, the learned rules, for accuracy.",
        "It is not only the quality of the collection of translations that affects the overall performance of the system, but also the quantity.",
        "The collection of translations has to be comprehensive so that the translation system produced will be able to translate as much types of sentences as possible.",
        "The challenge here is coming up with a quantity of examples that is sufficient for accurate translation of documents.",
        "With more data, a new problem arises when the knowledge-base grows so large that access to it and search for applicable rules during translation requires tremendous amount of access time and to an extreme, becomes difficult.",
        "Exponential growth of the knowledge-base may also happen due to the free word order nature of Filipino sentence construction, such that one English sentence can be translated to several Filipino sentences.",
        "When all these combinations are part of the translation examples, a translation rule will be learned and extracted by the system for each combination, thus, causing growth of the knowledge-base.",
        "Thus, algorithms that perform generalization of rules are considered to remove specificity of translation rules extracted and thus, reduce the size of the rule knowledge-base.",
        "One of the main problems in language processing most especially compounded in machine translation is finding the most appropriate translation of a word when there are several meanings of source words, and various target word equivalents depending on the context of the source word.",
        "One particular study that focuses on the use of syntactic relationships to perform word sense disambiguation has been explored (Domingo and Roxas, 2006).",
        "It uses an automated approach for resolving target-word selection, based on \"word-to-sense\" and \"sense-to-word\" relationship between source words and their translations, using syntactic relationships (subject-verb, verb-object, adjective-noun).",
        "Using information from a bilingual dictionary and word similarity measures from WordNet, a target word is selected using statistics from a target language corpus.",
        "Test results using English to Tagalog translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for selecting word translation.",

        "PinoyTalk is an initial study on a Filipino-based text to speech system that automatically generates the speech from input text (Casas, et al., 2004).",
        "The input text is processed and parsed from words to syllables, from syllables to letters, and assigned prosodic properties for each one.",
        "Six rules for Filipino syllabication were identified and used in the system.",
        "A rule-based model for Filipino was developed and used as basis for the implementation of the system.",
        "The following were determined in the study considering the Filipino speaker: duration of each phoneme and silences, intonation, pitches of consonants and vowel, and pitches of words with the corresponding stress.",
        "The system generates an audio output and able to save the generated file using the mp3 or wav file format.",
        "A system has been developed at the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at the University of the Philippines at Diliman to automatically recognize emotions such as anger, boredom, happiness and satisfaction (Ebarvia, et al., 2008)."
