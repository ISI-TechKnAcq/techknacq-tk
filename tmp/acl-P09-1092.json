        "There are many factors that influence word order, e.g. humanness, definiteness, linear order of grammatical functions, givenness, focus, constituent weight.",
        "In some cases, it can be relatively straightforward to automatically detect these features (i.e. in the case of definiteness, this is a syntactic property).",
        "The more complex the feature, the more difficult it is to automatically detect.",
        "It is common knowledge that information status (henceforth, IS) has a strong influence on syntax and word order; for instance, in inversions, where the subject follows some preposed element, Birner (1994) reports that the preposed element must not be newer in the discourse than the subject.",
        "We would like to be able to use information related to IS in the automatic generation of German text.",
        "Ideally, we would automatically annotate text with IS labels and learn from this data.",
        "Unfortunately, however, to date, there has been little success in automatically annotating text with IS.",
        "We believe, however, that despite this shortcoming, we can still take advantage of some of the insights gained from looking at the influence of IS on word order.",
        "Specifically, we look at the problem from a more general perspective by computing an asymmetry ratio for each pair of IS categories.",
        "Results show that there are a large number of pairs exhibiting clear ordering preferences when co-occurring in the same clause.",
        "The question then becomes, without being able to automatically detect these IS category pairs, can we, nevertheless, take advantage of these strong asymmetric patterns in generation.",
        "We investigate the (automatically detectable) morphosyntactic characteristics of each asymmetric IS pair and integrate these syntactic asymmetric properties into the generation process.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the underlying realisation ranking system for our experiments.",
        "Section 3 introduces information status and Section 4 describes how we extract and measure asymmetries in information status.",
        "In Section 5, we examine the syntactic characteristics of the IS asymmetries.",
        "Section 6 outlines realisation ranking experiments to test the integration of IS into the system.",
        "We discuss our findings in Section 7 and finally we conclude in Section 8."
