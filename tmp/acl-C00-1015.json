        "For about a decade and a half now, researchers in Natural language processing (NLP) and general and applied linguistics have been working with parallel corpora, i.e., in the prototypical case corpora consisting of original texts in some source language (SL) together with their translations into one or more target languages (TL).",
        "In general linguistics, they arc used – in the same fashion as monolingual corpora – as handy sources of authentic language.",
        "In computational linguistics and language engineering, various methods for (semi-)automatic extraction from such corpora of, among others, translation equivalents, have been explored.",
        "2 Why is word alignment more interesting and why is it difficult?",
        "Alignment – the explicit linking of items in the SL and TL texts judged to correspond to each other – is a prerequisite for the extraction of translation equivalents from parallel corpora, and the granularity of the alignment naturally determines what kind of translation units you can get out of these resources.",
        "With sentence alignment, you get data which can be used in, e.g., translation memories.",
        "If you want to build bi or multilingual lexica for machine translation systems (or for people), however, you want to be able to align parallel texts on the word (and phrase) level.",
        "This is because, in the last two decades, NLP grammars have become increasingly lexicalized, and grammars for machine translation – as opposed to translation memories, or example-based machine translation, neither of which uses a grammar in any interesting sense of the word – form no exception in this regard.",
        "The entries of the lexicon, which is the major repository of linguistic knowledge in a lexicalized grammar, are mainly made up of units on the linguistic levels of words and phrases.",
        "The problem here is that sentence alignment is a fairly well-understood problem, but word alignment is much less so.",
        "This means that while language-independent sentence alignment programs typically achieve a recall in the 90 percent range, the same cannot be said about word alignment systems, where normal recall figures tend to fall somewhere between 20 and 40 percent, in the language-independent case.",
        "Thus, we need methods to increase word alignment recall, preferably without sacrificing",
        "precision.' There are many conceivable reasons for word alignment being less 'effective' than sentence alignment.",
        "Different language structures ensure that words comparatively more seldom stand in a one-to-one relationship between the languages in a parallel text, because, e.g.,",
        "• SL function words may correspond to TL grammatical structural features, i.e. morphology or syntax, or even to nothing at all, if the TL happens not to express the feature in question.",
        "At the same time, function words tend to display a high type frequency, both because of high functional load (i.e., they are needed all over the place) and because they tend to be uninflected (i.e. each function word is typically represented by one text word type, while content words tend to appear in several inflectional variants).",
        "This of course means that function words will account for a relatively large share of the differences in recall figures between sentence and word alignment; • orthographic conventions may disagree on",
        "where word divisions should be written, as when compounds are written as several words in English, but as single words in German or Swedish, the extreme case being that some orthographies get along entirely without word divisions; • word alignment must by necessity (because word orders differ between languages) work with word types rather than with word tokens, while sentence lAlignment recall is here understood as the number of units aligned by the alignment program divided by the total number of correct alignments (established by independent means, normally by human annotation).",
        "Precision is the number of correct alignments (again established by independent means) divided by the number of units aligned by the alignment program (i.e., the numerator in the recall calculation).",
        "We will not in this paper go into a discussion of null alignments (source language units having no correspondence in the target language expression) or partial alignments (part, but not all, of a phrase aligned), as we believe that the results we present here are not dependent on a particular treatment of these – admittedly troublesome – phenomena.",
        "alignment always works with sentence tokens, i.e., it relies on linear order.",
        "This means that polysemy (one type in the SL corresponding to several types in the TL), homonymy (several types in the SL corresponding to one type in the TL), and combinations of polysemy and homonymy will disrupt the correspondence even between structurally similar languages; Thus, the circumstance that linear order cannot be used to constrain word alignment – beyond the restriction that putative word alignments must appear in one and the same sentence alignment unit – together with the other factors just mentioned, conspire to make word alignment a much harder problem than sentence alignment in the language-independent case.3"

        "Lately, we have been concentrating on finding good ways to improve word alignment.",
        "The word alignment system we currently use (which was developed in a sister project in our department, the PLUG project; see Sagvall Hein (to appear)) works iteratively with many kinds of information sources, and it seems that this is a good way to proceed.",

        "similarity (both between and within languages), and part of speech are some of the information sources used, and also (heuristically based) stemming to increase type frequencies for the distributional measures (see, e.g. Tiedemann (to appear a), Tiedemann (to appear b); Melamed (1995), Melamed (1998)).",
        "In our work in the ETAP project we are looking for additional such information sources, and so far we have concentrated our efforts on exploring linguistically rich information, such as word similarity (Bonin, 1998) and the combination of word alignment and POS tagging (Bonin, to appear a).",
        "There must certainly exist other sources of information, in addition to those mentioned above, that can be used to improve word alignment.",

        "Do the same for the indirect path SE-->PL-SBC and the direct path SE-->SBC In order for this procedure to work, we must believe that 1. there will be differences in the SE->PL and SE--+SBC alignments, and 2. that these differences will 'survive' the PL--4,SBC and SBC--->PL aligments.'",
        "Hypothesis (1) seems plausible, since the word alignment system used (Tiedemann (to appear a), Tiedemann (to appear b)) actually already utilizes several kinds of information to align the words in the two texts.",
        "In particular, it uses distributional information, cooccurrence statistics, iterative size reduction, `naive' stemming, and string similarity to select and rank word alignment candidates (but not linear order; cf. also section 3 above).",
        "Thus it is fully conceivable, e.g., that distributional information will provide one of the links and word similarity the other in a three-language path, such as SE-÷PL->SBC,' while synonymy or polysemy (i.e., distributional differences; see above) will 41t is this metaphor of the alignments going by different 'paths' or 'roads' to the same goal which has inspired me to borrow the first part of the title of this paper from the chorus of the song \"Loch Lomond\".",
