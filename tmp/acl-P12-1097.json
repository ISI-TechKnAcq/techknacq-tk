        "In the WMT shared tasks, many new generation metrics, such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover et al., 2006), and TESLA (Liu et al., 2010) have consistently outperformed BLEU as judged by the correlations with human judgments.",

        "However, many different segmentation standards exist for different purposes, such as Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Chinese Treebank (CTB) for parsing and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and City University of Hong Kong (CITYU) and Academia Sinica (AS) for general word segmentation and POS tagging.",

        "In this work, we devise a new MT evaluation metric in the family of TESLA (Translation Evaluation of Sentences with Linear-programming-based Analysis), called TESLA-CELAB (Character-level Evaluation for Languages with Ambiguous word Boundaries), to address the problem of fuzzy word boundaries in the Chinese language, although neither the phenomenon nor the method is unique to Chinese.",
        "Our metric combines the advantages of character-level and word-level metrics: 1.",
        "TESLA-CELAB is able to award scores for partial word-level matches.",
        "2.",
        "TESLA-CELAB does not have a segmentation step, hence it will not introduce word segmentation errors.",
        "3.",
        "TESLA-CELAB is able to take full advantage of the synonym dictionary, even when the synonyms differ in the number of characters.",
        "We show empirically that TESLA-CELAB significantly outperforms the strong baseline of character-level BLEU in two well known English-Chinese MT evaluation data sets.",
        "The source code of TESLA-CELAB is available from http://nlp.comp.nus.edu.sg/software/."
