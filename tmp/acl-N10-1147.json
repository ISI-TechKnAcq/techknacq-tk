        "Metaphors arise when one concept is viewed in terms of the properties of the other.",
        "In other words it is based on similarity between the concepts.",
        "Similarity is a kind of association implying the presence of characteristics in common.",
        "Here are some examples of metaphor.",
        "(3) And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.",
        "In metaphorical expressions seemingly unrelated features of one concept are associated with another concept.",
        "In the example (2) the computational process is viewed as something alive and, therefore, its forced termination is associated with the act of killing.",
        "Metaphorical expressions represent a great variety, ranging from conventional metaphors, which we reproduce and comprehend every day, e.g. those in (1) and (2), to poetic and largely novel ones, such as (3).",
        "The use of metaphor is ubiquitous in natural language text and it is a serious bottleneck in automatic text understanding.",
        "In order to estimate the frequency of the phenomenon, we conducted a corpus study on a subset of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) representing various genres.",
        "We manually annotated metaphorical expressions in this data and found that 241 out of 761 sentences contained a metaphor or (rarely) an idiom.",
        "Due to such a high frequency of their use, a system capable of interpreting metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text would become an invaluable component of any semantics-oriented NLP application.",
        "Automatic processing of metaphor can be clearly divided into two subtasks: metaphor recognition (distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language in text) and metaphor interpretation (identifying the intended literal meaning of a metaphorical expression).",
        "Both of them have been repeatedly addressed in NLP.",
        "To date the most influential account of metaphor recognition has been that of Wilks (1978).",
        "According to Wilks, metaphors represent a violation of selectional restrictions in a given context.",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "The verb drink normally takes an animate subject and a liquid object.",
        "Therefore, drink taking a car as a subject is an anomaly, which may as well indicate metaphorical use of drink.",
        "Most approaches to metaphor interpretation rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge (Fass, 1991; Martin, 1990; Narayanan, 1997; Narayanan, 1999; Feldman and Narayanan, 2004; Barnden and Lee, 2002; Agerri et al., 2007) and produce interpretations in a non-textual format.",
        "However, the ultimate objective of automatic metaphor processing is a type of interpretation that can be directly embedded into other systems to enhance their performance.",
        "Thus, we define metaphor interpretation as a paraphrasing task and build a system that automatically derives literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text.",
        "In summary, our system (1) produces a list of all possible paraphrases for a metaphorical expression (induced automatically from a large corpus); (2) ranks the paraphrases according to their likelihood derived from the corpus; (3) discriminates between literal and figurative paraphrases by detecting selectional preference violation and outputs the literal ones; and (4) disambiguates the sense of the paraphrases using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) inventory of senses.",
        "We tested our system on a collection of metaphorical expressions representing verb-subject and verb-object constructions, where the verb is used metaphorically.",
        "To compile this dataset we manually annotated such phrases in a subset of the BNC using the metaphor identification procedure (MIP) (Prag-glejaz Group, 2007).",
        "We then evaluated the quality of paraphrasing with the help of human annotators and created a gold standard for this task."

        "Since we focus on single-word metaphors expressed by a verb, our annotation task can be viewed as verb classification according to whether the verbs are used metaphorically or literally.",
        "However, some verbs have weak or no potential of being a metaphor and, thus, our study is not concerned with them.",
        "We excluded the following verb classes: (1) auxiliary verbs; (2) modal verbs; (3) aspectual verbs (e.g. begin, start, finish); (4) light verbs (e.g. take, give, put, get, make).",
        "Our corpus is a subset of the BNC.",
        "We sampled texts representing various genres: literature, newspaper/journal articles, essays on politics, international relations and history, radio broadcast (transcribed speech).",
        "The corpus contains 761 sentences and 13642 words.",
        "The annotation scheme we use is based on the principles of the metaphor identification procedure (MIP) developed by Pragglejaz Group (2007).",
        "We adopt their definition of basic sense of a word and their approach to distinguishing basic senses from the metaphorical ones.",
        "MIP involves metaphor annotation at the word level as opposed to identifying metaphorical relations (between words) or source-target domain mappings (between concepts or domains).",
        "Such annotation can be viewed as a form of word sense disambiguation with an emphasis on metaphoricity.",
        "In order to discriminate between the verbs used metaphorically and literally we use the following procedure as part of our guidelines:",
        "1.",
        "For each verb establish its meaning in context and try to imagine a more basic meaning of this verb on other contexts.",
        "As defined in the framework of MIP (Pragglejaz Group, 2007) basic meanings normally are: (1) more concrete; (2) related to bodily action; (3) more precise (as opposed to vague); (4) historically older.",
        "2.",
        "If you can establish the basic meaning that is distinct from the meaning of the verb in this context, the verb is likely to be used metaphorically.",
        "Consider the following example sentence:",
        "(5) If he asked her to post a letter or buy some razor blades from the chemist, she was transported with pleasure.",
        "In this sentence one needs to annotate four verbs that are underlined.",
        "The first 3 verbs are used in their basic sense, i.e. literally (ask in the context of \"a person asking another person a question or a favour\"; post in the context of \"a person posting/sending a letter\"; buy in the sense of \"making a purchase\").",
        "Thus, they are tagged as literal.",
        "The verb transport, however, in its basic sense is used in the context of \"goods being transported/carried by a vehicle\".",
        "The context in this sentence involves \"a person being transported by a feeling\", which contrasts the basic sense in that the agent of transporting is an EMOTION as opposed to a VEHICLE.",
        "Thus, we can infer that the use of transport in this sentence is metaphorical.",
        "We tested reliability of this annotation scheme using multiple annotators on a subset of the corpus.",
        "The rest of the annotation was done by a single annotator.",
        "Annotators We had three independent volunteer annotators, who were all native speakers of English and had some linguistics background.",
        "Material and Task All of them received the same text taken from the BNC containing 142 verbs to annotate.",
        "They were asked to classify verbs as metaphorical or literal.",
        "Guidelines and Training The annotators received written guidelines (2 pages) and were asked to do a small annotation exercise (2 sentences containing 8 verbs in total).",
        "The goal of the exercise was to ensure they were at ease with the annotation format.",
        "Interannotator Agreement We evaluate reliability of our annotation scheme by assessing interannota-tor agreement in terms of k (Siegel and Castellan, 1988).",
        "The classification was performed with the agreement of 0.64 (k), which is considered reliable.",
        "The main source of disagreement was the high conventionality of some expressions, i.e. cases where the metaphorical etymology could be clearly traced, but the senses are highly lexicalized.",
        "Only the phrases that were tagged as metaphorical by all of the annotators were included in the test set.",
        "Here are some examples of such phrases: memories were slipping away; hold the truth back; stirred an unfathomable excitement; factors shape results; mending their marriage; brushed aside the accusations etc.",
        "In order to avoid extra noise we placed some additional criteria to select the test phrases:",
        "(1) exclude phrases where subject or object referent is unknown, e.g. containing pronouns such as in in which they [changes] operated; (2) exclude phrases whose metaphorical meaning is realised solely in passive constructions (e.g. sociologists have been inclined to [..]); (3) exclude phrases where the subject or object of interest are represented by a named entity (e.g. Then Hillary leapt into the conversation); (4) exclude multiword metaphors (e.g. go on pilgrimage with Raleigh or put out to sea with Tennyson).",

        "Subsequently it identifies shared features of the paraphrases and the metaphorical verb using WordNet hierarchy of concepts and removes the unrelated concepts.",
        "Among the related paraphrases it then identifies the literal ones given the context relying on the automatically induced selectional preferences.",
        "We model the likelihood of a particular paraphrase as a joint probability of the following events: the interpretation (another term to replace the one used metaphorically) i co-occurring with the other lexical items from its context w1,wN in the relations r1,rN respectively.",
        "where w1,wN and r1,rN represent the fixed context of the term used metaphorically in the sentence.",
        "This context will be kept as part of the paraphrase, and the term used metaphorically will be replaced.",

        "E.g. for a verb in the presence of both the subject and the object the Verb-Subject and Verb-Object relations would be considered to be independent events within the model.",
        "This yields the following approximation:",
        "We can calculate the probabilities using maximum likelihood estimation where f(i) is the frequency of the interpretation on its own, k f(ik) is the number of times this part of speech is attested in the corpus and f (wn, rn, i) - the frequency of the co-occurrence of the interpretation with the context word wn in the relation rn.",
        "By performing appropriate substitutions into (2) we obtain",
        "This model is then used to rank the possible replacements of the term used metaphorically in the fixed context according to the data.",
        "The parameters of the model were estimated from the British National Corpus that was parsed using the RASP parser of Briscoe et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We used the grammatical relations (GRs) output of RASP same output of RASP was used to identify the GRs in the metaphorical expressions themselves, as the metaphor corpus from which they were extracted is a subset of the BNC.",
        "To obtain the counts for f(wn, rn, i) we extracted all the terms appearing in the corpus in the relation rn with wn for each lexical item - relation pair.",
        "The initial list of replacements for the metaphorical term was constructed by taking an overlap of the lists of terms for each lexical item - relation pair.",
        "It should be noted that the context-based model described in 3.1 overgenerates and hence there is a need to further narrow the search space.",
        "It is acknowledged in the linguistics community that metaphor is to a great extent based on similarity between the concepts involved.",
        "We exploit this fact to refine paraphrasing.",
        "After obtaining the initial list of possible substitutes for the metaphorical term, we filter out the terms whose meaning does not share any common features with that of the metaphorical term.",
        "Consider a Computer Science metaphor kill a process, which stands for terminate a process.",
        "The basic sense of kill implies an end or termination of life.",

        "Selecting the highest ranked paraphrase from this list as a literal interpretation will serve as a baseline.",

        "However, the task is to identify the literal interpretation, therefore, these need to be removed.",
        "One way of dealing with both problems at once is to take into account selectional preferences of the verbs in our list.",
        "The verbs used metaphorically are likely to demonstrate strong semantic preference for the source domain, e.g. suppress would select for movements (political) rather than ideas, or truth, (the target domain), whereas the ones used literally (e.g.,",
        "Table 1: The list of paraphrases with the initial ranking Table 2: The list of paraphrases reranked using selectional preferences",

        "It originates in the work of Wilks (1978) and utilizes hand-coded knowledge.",
        "Fass (1991) developed a system called met*, capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly.",
        "It does this in three stages.",
        "First, literalness is distinguished from non-literalness using selectional preference violation as an indicator.",
        "In the case that non-literalness is detected, the respective phrase is tested for being a metonymic relation using hand-coded patterns (such as CONTAINER-for-CONTENT).",
        "If the system fails to recognize metonymy, it proceeds to search the knowledge base for a relevant analogy in order to discriminate metaphorical relations from anomalous ones.",
        "E.g., the sentence in (4) would be represented in this framework as (car,drink,gasoline), which does not satisfy the preference (animal,drink,liquid), as car is not a hy-ponym of animal.",
        "met* then searches its knowledge base for a triple containing a hypernym of both the actual argument and the desired argument and finds (thing,use,energy.source), which represents the metaphorical interpretation.",

        "The idea behind this work is that the more specific conventional metaphors descend from the general ones.",
        "Given an example of a metaphorical expression, MIDAS searches its database for a corresponding metaphor that would explain the anomaly.",
        "If it does not find any, it abstracts from the example to more general concepts and repeats the search.",

        "We presented a novel approach to metaphor interpretation and a system that produces literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions.",
        "Such a representation is directly transferable to other applications that can benefit from a metaphor processing component.",
        "Our method is distinguished from the previous work in that it does not rely on any hand-crafted knowledge, other than WordNet, but in contrast employs automatically induced selectional preferences.",
        "Our system is the first of its kind and it is capable of paraphrasing metaphorical expressions with a high accuracy (0.81).",
        "Although we reported results on a test set consisting of verb-subject and verb-object metaphors only, we are convinced that the described interpretation techniques can be similarly applied to other parts of speech and a wider range of syntactic constructions.",
        "Extending the system to deal with more types of phrases is part of our future work."
