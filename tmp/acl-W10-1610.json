        "The striking differences between the Iliad and the Oddysey in the way the characters' behaviors are attributed to divine intervention, or to the individual's volition, has been pointed out by numerous scholars (Onians, 1988; Dodds, 1951; Adkins, 1970; De Jong and Sullivan, 1994).",
        "However, not until the highly influential work of Marshall McLuhan (McLuhan, 1962) and Julian Jaynes (Jaynes, 2000) was it pointed out that these changes may reflect not just artistic or even cultural tendencies, but profound alterations in the mental structure of those who wrote, collected and assimilated the stories.",
        "While",
        "McLuhan argued for a materialistic effect ofthe type of medium (the linearity of written language, the holistic nature of the moving image) on the organization of thoughts (linear or integrative, respectively), Jaynes proposed a more radical hypothesis: a relatively abrupt transition from a \"bicameral mind\", where one hemisphere produced godlike commands that the other followed blindly, to the modern mind with its ability of self-awareness.",
        "Moreover, Jaynes boldly suggested that this transition may have been accompanied by a physical process that altered the relationship between the hemispheres, and changed culture permanently.",
        "Since its publication, The origins of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind has been highly influential inside and outside scientific quarters, as well as a source of continuing controversy (Cavanna et al., 2007).",
        "Whether brought about by nature or nurture, however, Jaynes presents compelling arguments about the effects of this transition, including stylistic changes throughout the other foundational text of the western world, the Bible.",
        "Simply put, a less radical version of Jaynes' hypothesis would state that, within the judeo-greco-christian cultural tradition, there exists an \"arrow of time\" pointing to increasing introspection.",
        "The question we set out to answer in the present manuscript is to what extent it is possible to analyze, quantitatively, this hypothesis.",
        "The widespread availability of classic and modern literary texts has paved the road to a wide variety of linguistic studies.",
        "Matters of literary style and structure are necessarily more controversial, although the recent work of F. Moretti (Moretti, 2005) has shown that it is indeed possible to quantify the subtle variations in the structure of the novel over temporal peri-odizations and geographical locations.",
        "In any event, given that our intention is to complete a preliminary study of feasibility, we focus here on capturing the textual traces of words or lexical structures that can be reasonably argued to reflect introspective thinking on the part of the characters, using techniques from machine learning and computational linguistics."
