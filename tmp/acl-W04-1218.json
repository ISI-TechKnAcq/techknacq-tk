        "The optimal practice in NER yields efficient and highly reliable results based only on cheaply available resources like an annotated corpus of reasonable size and non-annotated data.",
        "Approaches rich in handcrafted knowledge or dependent on other language technology tools suffer from several limitations: They are laborious to maintain and to adapt to new domains, especially with respect to the creation and evaluation of the domain-sensitive lists of NEs.",
        "Furthermore, the application of additional tools like part-of-speech tagger, syntactic chunker etc.",
        "increases processing time, and it is not clear at the moment whether such tools facilitate the task without additional adaptations to the new domain.",

        "• any additional linguistic tools like morphological analyser, part of speech tagger or syntactic chunker; • any handcrafted linguistic resources like dictionaries; • any handcrafted knowledge providing lists",
        "like gazetteers, lists of NEs or lists of trigger words.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, NEs are phenomena located at the phrase-level.",
        "Nevertheless, for the sake of straightforwardness, we restrict our model to single words.",
        "To overcome the knowledge sparseness, the so-called three-level model of word form observance was developed and successfully applied to German person names (Rössler, 2004).",
        "In Section 4 we discuss our attempts to apply this model to the biomedical domain.",
        "The approach is based on linear SVM classifiers.",
        "SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is a powerful machine learning algorithm for binary classification able to handle large numbers of parameters efficiently.",

        "Beside the good classifier capabilities of non-linear kernels, they are very expensive in terms of processing time for training and applying.",
        "Therefore, we favor linear SVMs1 not suffering from these limitations.",
        "Instead of using surface words in combination with morphological analyses and/or handcrafted suffix and prefix lists, we represent words with a set of positional character n-grams.",
        "Using the training data, this set is compiled by extracting the last uni and bigram, three trigrams from the end, and three trigrams from the beginning of every word.",

        "Table 1 contains an example of this feature set f3.",
        "The representation is capable of capturing simple morphological regularities of NEs and the context words surrounding them.",
        "Additionally, we use deterministic word-surface features (feature set f1) commonly used in NER (see Bykel et al., 1997), indexing, for instance, whether a word form is capitalized, consists of numbers, contains capitals, etc.",
        "We also consider word length and map it to one dimension (feature set f2).",
        "To capture the context of the word to classify, we set a six-word window, consisting of the three preceding, the current, and the two succeeding words.",

        "We trained TnT (Brants, 1998), a Markov Model implemented for POS-tagging on the surface words, and used the probabilities for all classes as features for the SVMs (feature set f4 on Table 1).",
        "The second step was implemented within the post-processing component designed to transform the output of the SVM-classifiers to the IOB-notation.",
        "In order to facilitate the multi-class output, we set up a total of seven classifiers: Five of them specific to the five NE-classes and two additional classifiers assigning a general begin-tag and a general outside-tag.",
        "Although a dynamic programming approach to resolve the multi-class issue for SVMs is an important desideratum, we implemented asimple heuristic as a first step.",
        "To transform the output of the seven classifiers into the IOB-output, we first applied a simple one-vs-rest method based on the decision values of the SVMs.",
        "The general begin tag was used to support the correct detection of the B-tags.",
        "In a second post-processing step, we improved the results based on a definition of the revisability of a label assigned with respect to a competing label.",
        "According to this, a label is revisable if the competing label is among the three best labels and has a decision value higher than 0.2, or if the value of the outside-classifier is lower than 0.2, i.e. the label OUTSIDE is not that confident.",
        "A label is considered to be competing to the current label if it was assigned to the word before or the word after.",
        "4 Attempting to utilize the three-level model to the biomedical domain The three-level model described in Rössler (2004) is motivated by the fact that lexical resources in the form of named entity lists deal with surface words, i.e. word forms, thus ignoring the problems of homonymy and polysemy.",
        "To address this issue, we distinguish three different levels to observe word forms and the semantic labels assigned to them and show how they are related to and support the NER:",
        "• The local level describes a single occurrence of a word form.",
        "The correct labelling of these occurrences is the actual task of NER.",
        "• The discourse level describes all occurrences of a word form within a text unit and the semantic labels assigned to them.",
        "Addressing word sense disambiguation, Gale et al.",
        "(1992) introduced the idea of a word sense located at the discourse-level and observed a",
        "strong one-sense-per-discourse tendency, i.e. several occurrences of a polysemous word form have a tendency to belong to the same semantic class within one discourse.",
        "It is common practice in NER to utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non-predictive contexts (see e.g. Mikheev et al., 1999).",
        "• The corpus level describes all occurrences of a word form within all texts available for the application.",
        "The larger the corpus, the more likely a particular word form is seen as member of two or more semantic classes.",
        "In order to utilize the discourse level, all words tagged as entity within one MEDLINE abstract are stored in a dynamic lexicon.",
        "Then, the processed discourse unit is matched against the dynamic lexicon in order to detect entities in non-predictive contexts.",
        "To find the correct boundaries the unit is post-processed as described in Section 3.",
        "To reflect the issues concerning polysemy and homonymy of lexical resources, we propose sophisticated word-form based NE lists, representing how likely a particular entry will be tagged with a particular label.",
        "These values are specific for a corpus, i.e. they are located at the corpus level.",
        "To create such resources, we propose a form of lexical bootstrapping.",
        "We assume that the probabilities calculated on the basis of a weak classifier applied to a large unlabeled corpus are sufficient for our task.",
        "Therefore, we trained classifiers for all classes and applied them to a 30-million word corpus extracted from MEDLINE (1999), using the search term [”blood cell” or ”transcription factor”].",
        "This automatically annotated corpus was used to create a corpus specific lexicon containing about 95,000 word forms.",
        "For all these entries, we extracted the total frequency of being tagged with a particular label and the relative frequency of being tagged with a discretized decision value by the SVM classifiers, i.e. we set five thresholds and counted how often an item was labelled with a decision value fulfilling a particular threshold.",
        "Both techniques completely failed: Neither the utilization of the discourse-level, nor the lexical bootstrapping had a positive impact when applied to the biomedical domain.",
        "This raises the question on the specifics of the biomedical domain.",
        "The utilization of the discourse-level is proved of value in most NE-tasks, thus the failure within the biomedical domain is surprising.",
        "The one-sense-per-discourse tendency is obviously weaker in the biomedical domain, since genes and proteins can share the same name and be mentioned in the same abstract.",
        "Additionally, the NEs occurring within the GENIA corpus consist in average of more than two words and seem to be diverse in their appearance, even within one document.",
        "For almost every word form, even brackets and stop-words can be a part of an NE, it is a great deal of work to develop heuristics improving recall without lowering precision dramatically.",
        "Moreover, the method is highly sensitive to precision errors, as it spreads out elements tagged incorrectly.",
        "Furthermore, it is questionable if abstracts – due to their enormous density and shortness – are appropriate text units for this method.",
        "The failure of the lexical bootstrapping is more difficult to interpret since this technique is not that well-tested.",
        "In our experiments, it was successfully applied to German person names and also had some positive impact on German organization and location names.",
        "One source of problems can be seen in the low precision of the classifier used to create the annotated corpus.",
        "We assume that a high-precision and low-recall classifier will produce better lexical resources.",
        "Another source can be seen in the complexity and the length of biological names.",
        "The restriction to single words is probably not appropriate for the bootstrapping process.",
        "For future research, we will investigate the bootstrapping of external evidence, i.e. we will not focus on the learning of names, but rather on the units that indicate the beginning or the end of a name-class."
