        "errors introduced by early components cascade through the remainder of the pipeline causing subsequent components to commit additional errors.",

        "sentence example ?The horse raced past the barn fell.?",
        "To this end, this paper presents cross-task flexible transition models (CTF-TMs), which model multiple tasks and solve these tasks in a more flexible order than pipeline approaches.",
        "We implement and experiment with a CTF-TM for Arabic1 language processing and report experimental results for it on Arabic tokenization (i.e., clitic separation), affix detection, affix labeling, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.",
        "In addition to error propagation between modules within a parsing pipeline, errors may propagate within the parsing process itself due to the fixed order of operations of the parser.",
        "This is common for standard transition-based dependency parsing models (McDonald and Nivre, 2007), such as shift-reduce parsers, which incrementally construct a parse by processing the input in a fixed left-to-right or right-to-left fashion.",
        "However, using a transition model that allows a more flexible order of operations, such as Goldberg and Elhadad's (2010) parser, allows difficult decisions to be postponed until later, when more of the solution has been constructed.",
        "CTF-TMs extend this approach by modeling multiple tasks and providing this flexibility across tasks so that no one task needs to be complete before another can be partially solved.",
        "As a morphologically rich language, Arabic requires a significant number of processing steps.",
        "Arabic uses a variety of affixes to inflect for case, gender, number (including dual), and mood, has clitics that attach to other words, permits both VSO and SVO constructions, and rarely includes short vowels in written form.",
        "The presence of clitics and the absence of written short vowels are particularly significant sources of ambiguity.",
        "As Tsarfaty (2006) argues for Modern Hebrew, a Semitic language that shares these characteristics, we contend that mor",
        "phological analysis and parsing should be done in a unified framework, such as a CTF-TM, rather than by separate components.",
        "In this paper, we describe CTF-TMs, which can be used for a wide variety of NLP tasks, and present our Arabic CTF-TM for Arabic tokenization, affix detection, affix labeling, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing as well as the results obtained in applying it to our dependency conversion of the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri and Bies, 2004).",
        "We find that our Arabic CTF-TM for tokenization, affix detection, affix labeling, POS tagging, and parsing achieves slightly better results than a similar CTF-TM that performs all the tasks except parsing.",

        "Our system achieves tokenization accuracy similar to Kulick's (2011) state-of-the-art system for a standard split of the ATB part 3, and, in our experiments using ATB parts 1?3, our system achieves the highest labeled attachment, unlabeled attachment, and clitic separation figures (including pronomial clitics) for Arabic yet reported (although no other work can be compared directly)."

        "This strategy is much more flexible than shift-reduce style parsing because the system has more options available to it at any one step for building up the solution.",
        "However, simply having flexibility within a single component does not reduce error propagation to or from other components in a pipeline and, to mitigate the potential for this, one may use a cross-task flexible transition model (CTF-TM) that does not have to wait for lower level tasks to be 100% complete before starting work on higher level tasks.",
        "McDonald and Nivre (2007) define a transition system as follows:",

        "Second, we specify that there exists a routine for enumerating a set of anchors for any given configuration.",
        "Anchors are an organizational concept for dealing with arbitrary data structures; each anchor acts as a hook into some portion of the configuration that may be changed.",
        "Finally, there exist routines for enumerating legal actions that can be performed in relation to any anchor and, for training, a routine for verifying that performing a given action will lead to a configuration consistent with the final solution.",
        "The performance of an action constitutes a transition between configurations.3 It is quite straightfoward to adapt Goldberg and Elhadad's (2010) parsing approach to any configuration that is indexable by anchors, and in so doing we are able to create cross-task flexible transition models.",
        "3For example, in a fixed order, one-word-at-a-time POS tagging system, there would be only one anchor?the word currently being labeled?but, for a one-at-a-time POS tagger capable of tagging words in any order, the anchor set would contain the entire list of still-unlabeled words.",
