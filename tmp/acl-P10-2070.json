        "In this paper we adopt the general framework for summarization put forward by Sparck-Jones (1999) - which views summarization as a threefold process: interpretation, transformation and generation - and attempt to provide a clean instantiation for each processing phase, with a particular emphasis on the last, summary-generation phase often omitted or oversimplified in the mainstream work on summarization.",
        "The advantages of looking at the summarization problem in terms of distinct processing phases are numerous.",
        "It not only serves as a common ground for comparing different systems and understanding better the underlying logic and assumptions, but it also provides a neat framework for developing systems based on clean and extendable designs.",
        "For instance, Gong and Liu (2002) proposed a method based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and later J. Steinberger et al.",
        "(2007) showed that solely by enhancing the first source interpretation phase, one is already able to produce better summaries.",
        "There has been limited work on the last summary generation phase due to the fact that it is unarguably a very challenging problem.",
        "The vast",
        "Nello Cristianini",
        "amount of approaches assume simple sentence selection, a type of extractive summarization, where often the summary representation and the end summary are, indeed, conflated.",
        "The main focus of this work is, thus, to investigate robust ways for generating summaries from summary representations without recurring to simple sentence extraction and aiming at more human-like summaries.",
        "This decision is also motivated by empirical evidence from TAC 2009 data (see table 1) showing that human summaries contain on average more and shorter sentences than the system summaries.",
        "The intuition behind this is that, by containing more sentences, a summary is able to capture more of the important content from the source.",
        "Our initial experimental results show that our approach is feasible, since it produces summaries, which when evaluated against the TAC 2009 datayield ROUGE scores (Lin and Hovy, 2003) comparable to the participating systems in the Summarization task at TAC 2009.",
        "Taking into account that our approach is completely unsupervised and language-independent, we find our preliminary results encouraging.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in the next section we briefly survey the related work, in §3 we describe our approach to summarization, in §4 we explain how we tackle the generation step, in §5 we present and discuss our experimental results and towards the end we conclude and give pointers to future work."

        "The most closely related work to the approach presented hereby is work on summarization attempting to go beyond simple sentence extraction and to a lesser degree work on sentence compression.",
        "We survey below work along these lines.",
        "Although our approach is related to sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2008), it is subtly different.",
        "Firstly, we reduce the number of terms to be used in the summary at a global level, not at a local per-sentence level.",
        "Secondly, we directly exploit the resulting structures from the SVD making the last generation step fully aware ofprevious processing stages, as opposed to tackling the problem of sentence compression in isolation.",
        "A similar approach to our sentence reconstruction method has been developed by Quirk et al.",
        "(2004) for paraphrase generation.",
        "In their work, training and test sets contain sentence pairs that are composed of two different proper English sentences and a paraphrase of a source sentence is generated by finding the optimal path through a paraphrases lattice.",
        "Finally, it is worth mentioning that we are aware of the 'capsule overview' summaries proposed by Boguraev and Kennedy ( 997) which is similar to our TSR (see below), however, as opposed to their emphasis on a suitable browsing interface rather than producing a readable summary, we precisely attempt the latter."

        "Interpretation, Transformation and Generation",
        "We chose the LSA paradigm for summarization, since it provides a clear and direct instantiation of Sparck-Jones' three-stage framework.",
        "In LSA-based summarization the interpretation phase takes the form of building a term-by-sentence matrix A = [A\\, A2,..., An], where each column Aj = [ay ,a2j,..., anj]T represents the weighted term-frequency vector of sentence j in a given set of documents.",
        "We adopt the same weighting scheme as the one described in (Stein-berger et al., 2007), as well as their more general definition of term entailing not only unigrams and bigrams, but also named entities.",
        "The transformation phase is done by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the initial term-by-sentence matrix defined as A = USVT.",
        "The generation phase is where our main contribution comes in.",
        "At this point we depart from standard LSA-based approaches and aim at producing a succinct summary representation comprised only of salient terms - Term Summary Representation (TSR).",
        "Then this TSR is passed on to another module which attempts to produce complete sentences.",
        "The module for sentence reconstruction is described in detail in section 4, in what follows we explain the method for producing a TSR.",
        "To explain how a term summary representation (TSR) is produced, we first need to define two concepts: salience score of a given term and salience threshold.",
        "Salience score for each term in matrix A is given by the magnitude of the corresponding vector in the matrix resulting from the dot product of the matrix of left singular vectors with the diagonal matrix of singular values.",
        "More formally, let T = U • S and then for each term i, the salience score is given by |Tj|.",
        "Salience threshold is equal to the salience score of the top kth term, when all terms are sorted in descending order on the basis of their salience scores and a cutoff is defined as a percentage (e.g., top 15%).",
        "In other words, if the total number of terms is n, then 100 * k/n must be equal to the percentage cutoff specified.",
        "The generation of a TSR is performed in two steps.",
        "First, an initial pool of sentences is selected by using the same technique as in (Steinberger and Jezek, 2009) which exploits the dot product of the diagonal matrix of singular values with the right singular vectors: S • VT.",
        "This initial pool of sentences is the output of standard LSA approaches.",
        "Second, the terms from the source matrix A are identified in the initial pool of sentences and those terms whose salience score is above the salience threshold are copied across to the TSR.",
        "Thus, the TSR is formed by the most (globally) salient terms from each one of the sentences.",

        "To model our interpretation of the noisy channel, we make use of one of the most popular classes of SMT systems: the Phrase Based Model (PBM) (Zens et al., 2002; Och and Ney, 2001; Koehn et al., 2003).",

        "Additionally, we also measured these statistics of summaries produced by our system at five different percentage cutoffs: 100%, 15%, 10%, 5% and 1%.",
        "The results from this exploration are summarised in table 1.",
        "The most notable thing is that human summaries contain on average more and shorter sentences than the system summaries (see 2nd and 3rd column from left to right).",
        "Secondly, we note that as the percentage cutoff decreases (from 4th column rightwards) the characteristics of the summaries produced by our system are increasingly more similar to those of the human summaries.",
        "In other words, within the 100-word window imposed by the TAC guidelines, our system is able to fit more (and hence shorter) sentences as we decrease the percentage cutoff.",
        "Summarization performance results are shown in table 2.",
        "We used the standard ROUGE evaluation (Lin and Hovy, 2003) which has been also used for TAC.",
        "We include the usual ROUGE metrics: R1 is the maximum number of co-occurring unigrams, R2 is the maximum number of co-occurring bigrams and RSU4 is the skip bigram measure with the addition of unigrams as counting unit.",
        "The last five columns of table 2 (from left to right) correspond to summaries produced by our system at various percentage cutoffs.",
        "The 2nd column, LSAextract, corresponds to the performance of our system at producing summaries by sentence extraction only.",
        "In the light of the above, the decrease in performance from column LSAextract to column 'At 100%' can be regarded as reconstruction error.Then, as we decrease the percentage cutoff (from 4th column rightwards) we are increasingly covering more of the content comprised by the human summaries (as far as the ROUGE metrics are able to gauge this, of course).",
        "In other words, the improvement of content coverage makes up for the reconstruction error, and at 5% cutoff we already obtain ROUGE scores comparable to LSAextract.",
        "This suggests that if we improve the quality of our sentence reconstruction we would potentially end up with a better performing system than a typical LSA system based on sentence selection.",
        "Hence, we find these results very encouraging.",
