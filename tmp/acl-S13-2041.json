        "For two years, now, our team has focussed on researching global algorithms.",
        "The local algorithm we use, a variant of the Lesk algorithm that we have evaluated with several global algorithms (Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithms (ACA)) (Schwab et al., 2012; Schwab et al., 2013), has shown its robustness with WordNet 3.0.",
        "For the present campaign, we chose to work with an ant colony based global algorithms that has proven its efficiency (Schwab et al., 2012; Tchechmedjiev et al., 2012).",
        "Presently, for this SemEval 2013 Task 12 (Nav-igli et al., 2013), the objective is to disambiguate a set of target words (nouns) in a corpus of 13 texts in 5 Languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish) by providing, for each sense the appropriate sense labels.",
        "The evaluation of the answers is performed by comparing them to a gold standard annotation of the corpus in all 5 languages using three possible sense inventories and thus sense tags: BabelNet 1.1.1 Synset ids (Navigli and Pozetto, 2012), Wikipedia page names and Wordnet sense keys (Miller, 1995).",
        "Our ant colony algorithm is a stochastic algorithm that has several parameters that need to be selected and tuned.",

        "The score given to a sense pair is the number of common words (space separated strings) in the definition of the senses, without taking into account neither the word order in the definitions (bag-of-words approach), nor any syntactic or morphological information.",
        "Variants of this algorithm are still today among the best on English-language texts (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).",
        "Our local algorithm exploits the links provided by WordNet: it considers not only the definition of a sense but also the definitions of the linked senses (using all the semantic relations for WordNet, most of them for BabelNet) following (Banerjee and Ped-ersen, 2002), henceforth referred asExtLesk1 Con-1All dictionaries and Java implementations of all algorithms of our team can be found on our WSD page trarily to Banerjee, however, we do not consider the sum of squared sub-string overlaps, but merely a bag-of-words overlap that allows us to generate a dictionary from WordNet, where each word contained in any of the word sense definitions is indexed by a unique integer and where each resulting definition is sorted.",

        "We will first review the principles pertaining to global algorithms and then a more detailed account of our Ant Colony algorithm.",
        "A global algorithm is a method that allows to propagate a local measure to a whole text in order to assign a sense label to each word.",
        "In the similarity-based WSD perspective, the algorithms require some fitness measure to evaluate how good a configuration is.",
        "With this in mind, the score of the selected sense of a word can be expressed as the sum of the local scores between that sense and the selected senses of all the other words of a context.",
        "Hence, in order to obtain a fitness value (global score) for the whole configuration, it is possible to simply sum the scores for all selected senses of the words of the context: Score(C) =",
        "j=iExtLesk(wi,C[i], wj,C[j]).",
        "For a given text, the chosen configuration is the one which maximizes the global score among the evaluated ones.",
        "The simplest approach is the exhaustive evaluation of sense combinations (BF), used for example in (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002), that assigns a score to each word sense combination in a given context (window or whole text) and selects the one with the highest score.",
        "The main issue with this approach is that it leads to a combihttp://getalp.imag.fr/WSD and more specifically for SemEval 2013 Task 12 on the following page",
        "natorial explosion in the length of the context window or text.",
        "The number of combinations is indeed",
        "i=1(|s(wi)|), where s(wi) is the set of possible senses of word i of a text T .",
        "For this reason it is very difficult to use the BF approach on an analysis window larger than a few words.",
        "In our work, we consider the whole text as context.",
        "In this perspective, we studied several methods to overcome the combinatorial explosion problem.",
        "Several approximation methods can be used in order to overcome the combinatorial explosion issue.",
        "On the one hand, complete approaches try to reduce dimensionality using pruning techniques and sense selection heuristics.",
        "Some examples include: (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), based on lexical chains that restrict the possible sense combinations by imposing constraints on the succession of relations in a taxonomy (e.g. WordNet); or (Gelbukh et al., 2005) that review general pruning techniques for Lesk-based algorithms; or yet (Brody and Lapata, 2008) who exploit distributional similarity measures extracted from corpora (information content).",
        "On the other hand, incomplete approaches generally use stochastic sampling techniques to reach a local maximum by exploring as little as necessary of the search space.",
        "Our present work focuses on such approaches.",
        "Furthermore, we can distinguish two possible variants: ?",
        "local neighbourhood-based approaches (new configurations are created from existing configurations) among which are some approaches from artificial intelligence such as genetic algorithms or optimization methods such as simulated annealing; ?",
        "constructive approaches (new configurations are generated by iteratively adding new elements of solutions to the configuration under construction), among which are for example ant colony algorithms.",
        "2.2.3 Principle of our Ant Colony Algorithm In this section, we briefly describe out Ant Colony Algorithm so as to give a general idea of how it operates.",
        "However, readers are strongly encouraged to read the detailed papers (Schwab et al., 2012; Schwab et al., 2013) for a more detailed description of the system, including examples of how the graph is built, of how the algorithm operates step by step as well all pseudo code listing.",
        "Ant colony algorithms (ACA) are inspired from nature through observations of ant social behavior.",
        "Indeed, these insects have the ability to collectively find the shortest path between their nest and a source of food (energy).",
        "It has been demonstrated that cooperation inside an ant colony is self-organised and allows the colony to solve complex problems.",
        "The environment is usually represented by a graph, in which virtual ants exploit pheromone trails deposited by others, or pseudo-randomly explore the graph.",
        "ACAs are a good alternative for the resolution of optimization problems that can be encoded as graphs and allow for a fast and efficient exploration on par with other search heuristics.",
        "The main advantage of ACAs lies in their high adaptivity to dynamically changing environments.",
        "Readers can refer to (Dorigo and St?tzle, 2004) or (Monmarch?, 2010) for a state of the art.",
        "In this article we use a simple hierarchical graph (text, sentence, word) that matches the structure of the text and that exploits no external linguistic information.",
        "In this graph we distinguish two types of nodes: nests and plain nodes.",
        "Following (Schwab et al., 2012), each possible word sense is associated to a nest.",
        "Nests produce ants that move in the graph in order to find energy and bring it back to their mother nest: the more energy is brought back by ants, the more ants can be produced by the nest in turn.",
        "Ants carry an odour (a vector) that contains the words of the definition of the sense of its mother nest.",
        "From the point of view of an ant, a node can be: (1) its mother nest, where it was born; (2) an enemy nest that corresponds to another sense of the same word; (3) a potential friend nest: any other nest; (4) a plain node: any node that is not a nest.",
        "Furthermore, to each plain node is also associated an odour vector of a fixed length that is initially empty.",
        "Ant movement is function of the scores given by the local algorithm, of the presence of energy, of the passage of other ants (when passing on an edge ants leave a pheromone trail that evaporates over time) and of the nodes?",
        "odour vectors (ants deposit a part of their odour on the nodes they go through).",
        "When an ant arrives onto the nest of another word (that corresponds to a sense thereof), it can either continue its",
        "exploration or, depending on the score between this nest and its mother nest, decide to build a bridge between them and to follow it home.",
        "Bridges behave like normal edges except that if at any given time the concentration of pheromone reaches 0, the bridge collapses.",
        "Depending on the lexical information present and the structure of the graph, ants will fa-vor following bridges between more closely related senses.",
        "Thus, the more closely related the senses of the nests are, the more bridges between them will contribute to their mutual reinforcement and to the sharing of resources between them (thus forming meta-nests); while the bridges between more distant senses will tend to fade away.",
        "We are thus able to build interpretative paths (possible interpretations of the text) through emergent behaviour and to suppress the need to use a complete graph that includes all the links between the senses from the start (as is usually the case with classical graph-based optimisation approaches).",
        "Through the emergence of interpretative paths, sense pairs that are closer semantically benefit from an increased ant traffic and thus tend to capture most of the energy of the system at a faster pace, thus favouring a faster convergence over an algorithm that uses a local neighbourhood graph (nodes are senses interconnected so as to represent all sense combinations in a context window) without sacrificing the quality of the results.",
        "The selected answers correspond, for each word to the nest node with the highest energy value.",
        "The reason for this choice over using the pheromone concentration is that empirically, the energy level better correlates with the actual F1 scores.",
        "In turn, the global Lesk score of a selected sense combination correlates even better with the F1 score, which is why, we keep the sense combinations resulting from each iteration of the algorithm (highest energy nests at each iteration) and select the one with the highest global Lesk score as the final solution."

        "In this section we will first make a more detailed analysis for each text on the English corpus, by looking where our algorithm performed best.",
        "We restrict ourselves on one language for this analysis for the sake of brevity.",
        "As we can see in Table 2, the results can vary greatly depending on the text (within a twofold range).",
        "The system consistently performs better on texts from the general domain (T 4, 6, 10), often beating the first sense baseline.",
        "For more specialized texts, however, (T 2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13) the algorithm performs notably lower than the baseline.",
        "The one instance where the algorithm truly fails, is when the text in question contains many ambiguous entities.",
        "Indeed for text 7, which is about football, many of the instance words to disambiguate are the names of players and of clubs.",
        "Intuitively, this behaviour is understandable and can be mainly attributed to the local Lesk algorithm.",
        "Since we use glosses from the resource, that mostly remain in the general domain, a better performance in matching texts is likely.",
        "As for named entities, the Lesk algorithm is mainly meant to capture the similarity between concepts and it is much more difficult to differentiate two football players from a definition over concepts (often more general).",
        "To further outline the strength of our approach, we need to look back further at a setting with all parts of speech being considered, namely Task 7 from SemEval 2007.",
        "As can be seen in Table 3, even though for adjectives and adverbs the system is slightly below the MFS (respectively), it has a good performance compared to graph based WSD approaches that would be hindered by the lack of taxonomical relations.",
        "For verbs the performance is lower as is consistently observed with WSD algorithms due to the high degree of polysemy of verbs.",
        "For example, in the case of Degree (Navigli and Pozetto, 2012), nouns are the part of speech for which the system performs the best, while the scores for other parts of speech are somewhat lower.",

        "In this paper, we present a method based on a Lesk inspired local algorithm and a global algorithm based on ant colony optimisation.",
        "An endogenous version (parameter estimation based on the maximisation of the F-score on an annotated corpus) and an exogenous version (parameter estimation based on the maximisation of the global Lesk score on the corpus) of the latter algorithm do not exhibit a significant difference in terms of the F-score of the result.",
        "After a more detailed analysis on a text by text basis, we found that the algorithm performs best on general domain texts with as little named entities as possible (around or above the MFS baseline).",
        "For texts of more specialized domain the algorithm consistently performs below the MFS baseline, and for texts with many named entities, the performance plummets greatly slightly above the level of a random selection.",
        "We also show that with our Lesk measure the system is best suited for WSD in a more general setting with all parts of speech, however in the context of just nouns, it is not the most suitable local measure.",
        "As we have seen from the other systems, graph based local measures may be the appropriate answer to reach the level of the best systems on this task, however it is important not to dismiss the potential of other approaches.",
        "The quality of the results depend on the global algorithm, however they are also strongly bounded by the local measure considered.",
        "Our team, is headed towards investigating local semantic similarity measures and towards exploiting multilingual features so as to improve the disambiguation quality."
