        "In the framework of projects ChinFaDial and ERIM we have developed in recent years several platforms allowing to handle various aspects of bilingual spoken dialogues on the web – mainly, spontaneous speech corpus collection through distant human interpreting.",
        "Current development of the core ERIM-Interp and ERIM-Collect platforms now includes multimodal user interaction, integration of some machine aids (such as speech turn logs through speech recognition, or tentatively speech machine translation, both based on server-grounded market products), and next, online aids to speakers and/or interpreters.",
        "First collected data should be made available on the web in fall 2004 (DistribDial) along with, as soon as available, a robust version of the collecting platform, in order to promote collaborative building, and sharing, of \"raw\" unannotated multilingual speech corpora.",
        "A variant of the ERIM environment is to extend to distant e-training in interpreting, possibly creating situations which should in turn, in our view, foster larger-scale data collection and sharing in open access mode."

        "Ongoing burst in the development of both portable telecommunications tools open to Internet transactions, and videoconferencing means, is creating rapid expansion of teleservicing and telebusiness applications with spontaneous dialogue, information inquiry, distant negotiation, etc.",
        "Multilingualism, now in spoken transaction as it has been in written one, appears as a key issue in distant communication, with sensitive questions, both in supporting the diversity of the native or origin language of conversing users (particularly within the opening European economic area), and in bringing some kind of balance between main \"linguae francae\" (common languages).",
        "Thus new stakes arise in enhancing distant web-based on-line interpreting services.",
        "Meanwhile, Speech Machine Translation (SMT) steadily takes steps towards style spontaneity and multilingualism.",
        "In this context though, we face a notorious lack of large open-access corpora of bilingual spoken dialogues.",
        "This led us to study, to model and propose a set of generic platforms, aiming at enhancing distant multilingual multimodal oral communication with full recording and collecting facilities, also addressing expectations from the MT systems engineering community.",
        "The paper first looks over project motivation, then introduces the interpreting and collecting platforms presently available in the ERIM family, with current variants.",
        "It then reports on their first use in collecting domain-oriented spontaneously spoken French-Chinese dialogues.",
        "Finally we present ongoing or planned development, advocating for collaborative building and voluntary sharing of resulting multilingual resources."

        "It is widely recognized that realistic and large corpora are key resources for building Speech Recognition (SR) and Speech MT systems.",
        "If the Web has recently been put to use as the largest possible corpus, modeling casual spontaneous spoken language requires transcribed speech corpora of hundreds of hours.",
        "Speech translation systems thus need large parallel translation corpora of transcribed and aligned spontaneous utterances in dialogue context, ideally with complete sets of parse trees.",
        "However, few such corpora have been developed (by NEC, ATR and a few others), and these are not publicly available.",
        "Why not?",
        "Because these corpora are very expensive to transcribe once collected, and to annotate.",
        "After so much time has been spent in compiling a corpus, giving it away seems unreasonable.",
        "Besides, a future research objective is to use collected corpora for studying and modeling real life spontaneous spoken language and dialogues, and possibly to investigate if and how specific linguistic traits can be expected depending on specific dialogue situations, translation process settings, or various multimodal interaction means.",
        "For instance, two speakers in a bilingual dialogue may hear one another's original speech or not, they may use video or fixed images, etc.",
        "Their linguistic behavior is expected to vary accordingly: the number of clarification sub-dialogues may vary; third person use or indirect speech may be used more in the presence of a speech translation system than with a human interpreter; the use of deictic and anaphoric elements may turn out to depend on the use of visible markable objects on whiteboards, maps, images.",
        "With these considerations in mind, we thus endeavoured to propose open-acces corpus resources – and therefore open-access collecting resources – , in order to ease collaborative building of \"raw\" unannotated multilingual translated speech corpora, likely taking advantage of new web-based interpreting situations or scenarios."
