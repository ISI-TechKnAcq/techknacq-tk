        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of machine translation and information retrieval.",
        "Named entities are words which belong to certain categories like persons, places, organizations, numerical quantities, expressions of times etc.",
        "A large number of techniques have been developed to recognize named entities for different languages.",
        "Some of them are Rule based and others are Statistical techniques.",
        "The rule based approach uses the morphological and contextual evidence (Kim and Woodland, 2000) of a natural language and consequently determines the named entities.",
        "This eventually leads to formation of some language specific rules for identifying named entities.",
        "The statistical techniques use large annotated data to train a model (Malouf, 2002) (like Hidden Markov Model) and subsequently examine it with the test data.",
        "Both the methods mentioned above require the efforts of a language expert.",
        "An appropriately large set of annotated data is yet to be made available for the Indian Languages.",
        "Consequently, the application of the statistical technique for Indian Languages is not very feasible.",
        "This paper deals with a new technique to recognize named entities of different languages.",
        "Our approach does not use the previously mentioned techniques.",
        "Instead, we use an approach that not only reduces the burden of collecting and annotating data, but is language independent as well.",
        "We use this method to build a multilingual named entity list that can be used by the named entity recognizer.",
        "Our method recognizes and finds the actual representation of the named entities in the target language from an untagged corpus.",
        "Our idea was to match the two representations of the same named entity in two different languages using a phonetic matching algorithm.",
        "This comes from the property of named entities that they sound similar when written in native script or any other script.",
        "However this cross-lingual matching is not a trivial task.",
        "First of all, the two strings to be matched have to be represented in a common script.",
        "So we face two choices here.",
        "Either we should convert the two strings into some common intermediate representation (ex.",
        "Phonemic representation) or transliterate the name written in Indian language to English and then look for phonetic equivalence.",
        "Our engine has been tested for Hindi.",
        "After making transliteration rules for Hindi, we used a variation of the Editex algorithm to match the transliterated string with entries in English named entity database to find a match.",
        "Here it is worthwhile to mention that certain class of name entities which are not similar sounding (mostly phrases) cannot be extracted through this cross-lingual matching.",
        "E.g. \"United Nations\", \"Government of India\" etc.",
        "Abbreviations which are spelled character by character in both the languages can however be extracted.",
