        "However, one exception is IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) for word alignment, which is the only model commonly used for unsupervised learning in NLP that has a concave log-likelihood function.1 For other models, such as those used in unsupervised part-of-speech tagging and grammar induction, and indeed for more sophisticated word alignment models, the log-likelihood function maximized by EM is non-concave.",
        "As a result, researchers are obligated to consider initialization in addition to model design (Klein and Manning, 2004; Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "For example, consider the dependency grammar induction results shown in Table 1 when training the",
        "widely used dependency model with valence (DMV; Klein and Manning, 2004).",
        "Using uniform distributions for initialization (UNIF) results in an accuracy of 17.6% on the test set, well below the baseline of attaching each word to its right neighbor (ATTACHRIGHT, 31.7%).",
        "Furthermore, when using a set of 50 random initializers (RAND), the standard deviation of the accuracy is an alarming 8.3%.",
        "In light of this sensitivity to initialization, it is compelling to consider unsupervised models with concave log-likelihood functions, which may provide stable, data-supported initializers for more complex models.",
        "In this paper, we explore the issues involved with such an expedition and elucidate the limitations of such models for unsupervised NLP.",
        "We then present simple concave models for dependency grammar induction that are easy to implement and offer efficient optimization.",
        "We also show how linguistic knowledge can be encoded without sacrificing concavity.",
        "Using our models to initialize the DMV, we find that they lead to an improvement in average accuracy across 18 languages."
