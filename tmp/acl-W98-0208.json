        "Figure 2a illustrates the application of FISH to three Wide Area Information Server (WAIS)TM databases containing information on joint ventures from the Message Understanding Conference (MUC).",
        "Figure 2b illustrates the application of FISH to visualize email clustered by topic type for a moderator supporting a National Performance Review electronic town hall.",
        "The traditional WAIS interface of a query box and a list of resulting hits is replaced by an interface which includes a query box, a historical list of queries, and a graphically encoded display of resulting hits (an example of which is shown in Figure 2a).",
        "In WAIS, the relevancy of a document to a given keyword query is measured on a scale from 1-1000 (where 1000 is the highest relevancy) by the frequency and location of (stems of) query keywords in documents.",
        "Motivated by the University of Maryland's TreeMap research for hierarchical information visualization, FISH encodes the relevance of each document to a given query (or set of compound queries) using both color saturation and size.",
        "In the example presented in Figure 2a, each database is allocated screen size in proportion to the number of and degree with which documents are relevant to the given query.",
        "For example, the MEAD database on the left of the output window is given more space than the PROMT database in the middle because it has many more relevant documents.",
        "Similarly, individual documents that have higher relevancy measures for a given query are given proportionally more space and a higher color saturation.",
        "In this manner, a user can rapidly scan several large lists of documents to find relevant ones by focusing on those with higher color saturation and more space.",
        "Compound queries can be formulated via the \"Document Restrictions\" menu by selecting the union or intersection of previous queries, in effect an AND or OR Boolean operator across queries.",
        "In Figure 2a, the user has selected the union of documents relevant to the query \"japan\" and the query \"automobile\", which will return all documents which contain the keywords \"japan\" or \"automobile\".",
        "Color coding can be varied on these documents, for example, to keep their color saturation distinct (e.g., blue vs. red) to enable rapid contrast of hits across queries within databases (e.g., hits on Japan vs. hits on automobile) or to mix their saturation so that intersecting keyword hits can be visualized (e.g., bright blue-reds could indicate highly relevant Japanese automobile documents, dark the opposite).",
        "In the example in Figure 2a, blue encodes Japan, red Automobile; the color coding is set for mixed saturation, the union of the relevant document sets for those two keywords is selected, and the order (from top to bottom in the display) is used to encode the WAIS relevancy ranking.",
        "One issue is just how effectively users can discriminate mixed colors.",
        "More recently, we have explored multiple server evaluation on popular World Wide Web search engines.",
        "For example, Figure 2c illustrates a query across multiple servers.",
        "Research issues include differences in relevancy ranking algorithms, encoding of multiple attributes beyond relevancy using color or size (e.g., length,",
