        "Although formally syntactic, such models rarely respect linguistically-motivated syntax, and have no formal notion of semantics.",
        "As a result, they tend to produce translations containing both grammatical errors and semantic role confusions.",
        "Our goal is to take advantage of syntactic and semantic parsing to improve translation quality of HPB translation models.",
        "Rather than introducing semantic structure into the HPB model directly, we construct an improved translation model by incorporating linguistically motivated syntactic constraints into a standard HPB model.",
        "Once the translation phrases are linguistically constrained, we are able to propose a predicate-argument reordering model.",
        "This reordering model aims to solve two problems: ensure that arguments are ordered properly after translation, and to ensure that the proper argument structures even exist, for instance in the case of PRO-drop languages.",
        "Experimental results on Chinese-to-English translation show that both the hard syntactic constraints and the predicate-argument reordering model obtain significant improvements over the syntactically and semantically uninformed baseline.",
        "In principle, semantic frames (or, more specifically, predicate-argument structures: PAS) seem to be a promising avenue for translational modeling.",
        "While languages might diverge syntactically, they are less likely to diverge semantically.",
        "This has previously been recognized by Fung et al. (2006), who report that approximately 84% of semantic role mappings remained consistent across translations between English and Chinese.",
        "Subsequently, Zhuang and Zong (2010) took advantage of this consistency to jointly model semantic frames on Chinese/English bitexts, yielding improved frame recognition accuracy on both languages.",
        "While there has been some encouraging work on integrating syntactic knowledge into Chiang's HPB model, modeling semantic structure in a linguistically naive translation model is a challenge, because the semantic structures themselves are syntactically motivated.",

        "Translation rules in an HPB model are extracted from initial phrase pairs, which must include at least one word inside one phrase aligned to a word inside the other, such that no word inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside the other phrase.",
        "It is not surprising to observe that initial phrases frequently are non-intuitive and inconsistent with linguistic constituents, because they are based only on statistical word alignments.",
        "Nothing in the framework actually requires linguistic knowledge.",
        "Koehn et al. (2003) conjectured that such non-intuitive phrases do not help in translation.",

        "However, their phrase-based translation experiments (on Europarl data) showed the restriction to syntactic constituents is actually harmful, because too many phrases are eliminated.",
        "The idea of hard syntactic constraints then seems essentially to have been abandoned: it doesn't appear in later work.",
        "On the face of it, there are many possible reasons Koehn et al. (2003)'s hard constraints did not work, including, for example, tight restrictions that unavoidably exclude useful phrases, and practical issues like the quality of parse trees.",
        "Although ensuing work moved in the direction of soft syntactic constraints (see Section 6), our ultimate goal of capturing predicate-argument structure requires linguistically valid syntactic constituents, and therefore we revisit the idea of hard constraints, avoiding problems with their strictness by relaxing them in three ways.",
        "First, requiring source phrases to be subtrees in a linguistically informed syntactic parse eliminates many reasonable phrases.",
        "Consider the English-Chinese phrase pair ?the red car, hongse de qiche?.1 It is easily to get a translation entry for the whole phrase pair.",
        "By contrast, the phrase pair ?the red, hongse de?",
        "is typically excluded because it does not correspond to a complete subtree on the source side.",
        "Yet translating the red is likely to be more useful than translating the red car, since it is more general: it can be followed by any other noun translation.",
        "To this end, we relax the syntactic constraints by allowing phrases on the source side corresponding to either one subtree or sibling subtrees with a common parent node in the syntactic parse.",
        "For example, the red in Figure 1(a) is allowed since it spans two subtrees that have a common parent node NP.",
        "Second, we might still exclude useful phrases because the syntactic parses of some languages, like Chinese, prefer deep trees, resulting in a head and its modifiers being distributed across multiple structural levels.",
        "Consider the English sentence I still",
        "like the red car very much and its syntactic structure as shown in Figure 1(a).",
        "Phrases I still, still like, I still like are not allowed, since they don't map to either a subtree or sibling subtrees.",
        "Logically, however, it might make sense not just to include phrases mapping to (sibling) subtrees, but to include phrases mapping to subtrees with the same head.",
        "To this end, we flatten the syntactic parse so that a head and all its modifiers appear at the same level.",
        "Another advantage of this flattened structure is that flattened trees are more reliable than unflattened ones, in the sense that some bracketing errors in unflattened trees can be eliminated during tree flattening.",
        "Figure 1(b) illustrates flattening a syntactic parse by moving the head (like) and all its modifiers (I, still, the red car, and very much) to the same level.",
        "Third, initial phrase pair extraction in Chiang's HPB generates a very large number of rules, which makes training and decoding very slow.",
        "To avoid this, a widely used strategy is to limit initial phrases to a reasonable length on either side during rule extraction (e.g., 10 in Chiang (2007)).",
        "A corresponding constraint to speed up decoding prohibits any X from spanning a substring longer than a fixed length, often the same as the maximum phrase length in rule extraction.",
        "Although the initial phrase length limitation mainly keeps non-intuitive phrases out, it also closes the door on some useful phrases.",
        "For example, a translation rule ?I still like X, wo rengran xihuan X?",
        "will be prohibited if the non-terminal X covers 8 or more words.",
        "In contrast, our hard constraints have already filtered out dominating non-intuitive phrases; thus there is more room to include additional useful phrases.",

        "In addition to the fact that the constraints of Shen et al. (2010) and this paper are based on different syntactic perspectives (i.e., dependency structure vs. constituency structure), the major difference is that in this work we don't limit the length of phrases to a fixed maximum size (e.g., 10 in Hiero).",
        "Consequently, we obtain some translation rules that are not found in Hiero systems constrained by the length.",

        "Although Xiong et al. (2012) and our work are both focusing on source side PAS reordering, our model differs from theirs in two main aspects: 1) we consider reordering not only between an argument and its predicate, but also between two arguments; and 2) our reordering model can naturally model cases of untranslated arguments or predicates."
