        "Translation knowledge acquisition from parallel/comparative corpora is one of the most important research topics of corpus-based MT.",
        "This is because it is necessary for an MT system to (semi-)automatically increase its translation knowledge in order for it to be used in the real world situation.",
        "One limitation of the corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition approach is that the techniques of translation knowledge acquisition heavily rely on availability of parallel/comparative corpora.",
        "However, the sizes as well as the domain of existing parallel/comparative corpora are limited, while it is very expensive to manually collect parallel/comparative corpora.",
        "Therefore, it is quite important to overcome this resource scarcity bottleneck in corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition research.",
        "In order to solve this problem, we proposed an approach of taking bilingual news articles on Web news sites as a source for translation knowledge acquisition (Utsuro et al., 2003).",
        "In the case of Web news sites in Japan, Japanese as well as English news articles are updated everyday.",
        "Although most of those bilingual news articles are not parallel even if they are from the same site, certain portion of those bilingual news articles share their contents or at least report quite relevant topics.",
        "This characteristic is quite important for the purpose of translation knowledge acquisition.",
        "Utsuro et al.",
        "(2003) showed that it is possible to acquire translation knowledge of domain specific named entities, event expressions, and collocational expressions from the collection of bilingual news articles on Web news sites.",
        "Based on the results of our previous study, this paper further examines the correlation of term frequency and the reliability of bilingual term correspondences estimated from bilingual news articles.",
        "We show that, for high frequency terms, it is relatively easier to reliably estimate bilingual term correspondences.",
        "However, for low frequency terms, it is relatively harder to reliably estimate bilingual term correspondences.",
        "Low frequency problem of this type often happens when a sufficient number of bilingual news articles are not available at hand.",
        "Considering such a situation, this paper then proposes to complementarily use much larger monolingual Web documents collected by search engines, as a resource for reliably re-estimating bilingual term correspondences.",
        "Those collected monolingual Web documents are regarded as comparable corpora.",
        "Here, a standard technique of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora is employed.",
        "In the evaluation, we show that, using a sufficient number of monolingual Web documents, it is relatively easier to have reliable estimate of bilingual term correspondences.",
        "As one of the most remarkable experimental evaluation results, we further show that, for the terms which appear infrequently in news articles, the accuracy of re-estimating bilingual term correspondences does actually improve."
