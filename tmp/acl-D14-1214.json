        "Social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter have recently challenged mainstream media as the freshest source of information on important news events.",
        "In addition to an important source for breaking news, social media presents a unique source of information on private events, for example a friend's engagement or college graduation (examples are presented in Figure 1).",
        "While a significant amount of previous work has investigated event extraction from Twitter (e.g., (Rit- ter et al., 2012; Diao et al., 2012)), existing approaches mostly focus on public bursty event ex-traction, and little progress has been made towards the problem of automatically extracting the major life events of ordinary users.",
        "A system which can automatically extract major life events and generate fine-grained descriptions as in Figure 1 will not only help Twitter users with the problem of information overload by summarizing important events taking place in their friends lives, but could also facilitate downstream applications such as friend recommendation (e.g., friend recommendation in realtime to people who were just admitted into the same university, get the same jobs or internships), targeted online advertising (e.g., recommend baby care products to newly expecting mothers, or wedding services to new couples), information extraction, etc.",
        "Before getting started, we first identify a number of key challenges in extracting significant life events from user-generated text, which account the reason for the lack of previous work in this area: Challenge 1: Ambiguous Definition for Major Life Events Major life event identification is an open-domain problem.",
        "While many types of events (e.g., marriage, engagement, finding a new job, giving birth) are universally agreed to be im-portant, it is difficult to robustly predefine a list of characteristics for important life events on which algorithms can rely for extraction or classification.",
        "Challenge 2: Noisiness of Twitter Data: The user-generated text found in social media websites such as Twitter is extremely noisy.",
        "The language used to describe life events is highly varied and ambiguous and social media users frequently discuss public news and mundane events from their daily lives, for instance what they ate for lunch.",
        "Even for a predefined life event category, such as marriage, it is still difficult to accurately identify mentions.",
        "For instance, a search for the keyphrase ?get married?",
        "using Twitter Search 1 results in a large number of returned results that do not correspond to a personal event: ?",
        "I want to get married once.",
        "No divorce & no cheating, just us two till the end.",
        "(error: wishes) 1 https://twitter.com/search?q= get ?",
        "married 1997 Figure 1: Examples of users mentioning personal life events on Twitter.",
        "?",
        "Can Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore just drop the pretense and get married already?",
        "(error: somebody else) ?",
        "I got married and had kids on purpose (error: past) Challenge 3: the Lack of Training Data Collecting sufficient training data in this task for machine learning models is difficult for a number of reasons: (1) A traditional, supervised learning ap-proach, requires explicit annotation guidelines for labeling, though it is difficult to know which categories are most representative in the data apriori.",
        "(2) Unlike public events which are easily identified based on message volume, significant private events are only mentioned by one or several users directly involved in the event.",
        "Many important categories are relatively infrequent, so even a large annotated dataset may contain just a few or no examples of these categories, making classification difficult.",
        "In this paper, we present a pipelined system that addresses these challenges and extracts a structured representation of individual life events based on users?",
        "Twitter feeds.",
        "We exploit the insight to automatically gather large volumes of major life events which can be used as training examples for machine learning models.",
        "Although personal life events are difficult to identify using traditional approaches due to their highly diverse nature, we noticed that users?",
        "followers often directly reply to such messages with CONGRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES speech acts, for example: User1: I got accepted into Harvard !",
        "User2: Congratulations !",
        "These speech acts are easy to identify with high precision because the possible ways to express them are relatively constrained.",
        "Instead of directly inspecting tweets to determine whether they correspond to major life events, we start by identifying replies corresponding to CONGRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES, and then retrieve the message they are in response to, which we assume refer to important life events.",
        "The proposed system automatically identifies major life events and then extracts correspondent event properties.",
        "Through the proposed system, we demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically reconstruct a detailed list of individual life events based on users?",
        "Twitter streams.",
        "We hope that work presented in this paper will facilitate downstream applications and encourage follow-up work on this task.",
        "2 System Overview An overview of the components of the system is presented in Figure 2.",
        "Pipeline1 first identifies the major life event category the input tweet talks about and filters out the irrelevant tweets and will be described in Section 4.",
        "Next, Pipeline2, as, demonstrated in Section 5, identifies whether the speaker is directly involved in the life event.",
        "Fi-nally, Pipeline3 extracts the property of event and will be illustrated in Section 6.",
        "Section 3 serves as the preparing step for the pipelined system, describing how we collect training data in large-scale.",
        "The experimental evaluation regarding each pipeline of the system is presented in the corresponding section (i.e., Section 4,5,6) and the end-to-end evaluation will be pre-1998 Figure 2: System Overview.",
        "Blue: original input tweets.",
        "Red: filtered out tweets.",
        "Magenta: life event category.",
        "Green: life event property.",
        "Pipeline 1 identifies the life category the input tweet talks about (e.g., marriage, graduation) and filter out irrelevant tweets (e.g., I had beef stick for lunch).",
        "Pipeline 2 identifies whether the speaker is directly involved in the event.",
        "It will preserve self-reported information (i.e. ?I got married?)",
        "and filtered out unrelated tweets (e.g., ?my friend Chris got married?).",
        "Pipeline 3 extracts the property of event (e.g. to whom the speaker married or the speaker admitted by which university).",
        "sented in Section 7.",
        "3 Personal Life Event Clustering In this section, we describe how we identify common categories of major life events by leveraging large quantities of unlabeled data and obtain a collection of tweets corresponding to each type of identified event.",
        "3.1 Response based Life Event Detection While not all major life events will elicit CONGRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES from a user's followers, this technique allows us to collect large volumes of high-precision personal life events which can be used to train models to recognize the diverse categories of major life events discussed by social media users.",
        "3.2 Life Event Clustering Based on the above intuition, we develop an approach to obtain a list of individual life event clusters.",
        "We first define a small set of seed responses which capture common CONGRATULATIONS and CONDOLENCES, including the phrases: ?Congrat- ulations?, ?Congrats?, ?Sorry to hear that?, ?Awe- some?, and gather tweets that were observed with seed responses.",
        "Next, an LDA (Blei et al., 2003) 2 based topic model is used to cluster the gathered 2 Topic Number is set to 120. tweets to automatically identify important categories of major life events in an unsupervised way.",
        "In our approach, we model the whole conversation dialogue as a document 3 with the response seeds (e.g., congratulation) masked out.",
        "We furthermore associate each sentence with a single topic, following strategies adopted by (Ritter et al., 2010; Gruber et al., 2007).",
        "We limit the words in our document collection to verbs and nouns which we found to lead to clearer topic representations, and used collapsed Gibbs Sampling for inference (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Next one of the authors manually inspected the resulting major life event types inferred by the model, and manually assigned them labels such as ?getting a job?, ?graduation?",
        "or ?marriage?",
        "and discarded incoherent topics 4 .",
        "Our methodology is inspired by (Ritter et al., 2012) that uses a LDA-CLUSTERING+HUMAN-IDENTIFICATION strategy to identify public events from Twitter.",
        "Similar strategies have been widely used in unsupervised information extraction (Bejan et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2011) and selectional preference 3 Each whole conversation usually contains multiple tweets and users.",
        "4 While we applied manual labeling and coherence evaluation in this work, an interesting direction for future work is automatically labeling major life event categories following previous work on labeling topics in traditional document-based topic models (Mimno et al., 2011; Newman et al., 2010).",

        "3.3 Expanding dataset using Bootstrapping While our seed patterns for identifying messages expressing CONGRATULATIONS and CONDOLENCES are very high precision, they don't cover all the possible ways these speech acts can be expressed.",
        "We therefore adopt a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach to expand our reply seeds and event-related tweets.",
        "Our bootstrapping approach is related to previous work on semi-supervised information harvesting (e.g., (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b; Davidov et al., 2007)).",

        "seeds).",
        "We collect responses to the newly added tweets, then select the top 20 frequent replies 5 .",
        "Next we manually inspect and filter the top ranked replies, and use them to harvest more tweets.",
        "This process is then repeated with another round of inference in LDA including manual labeling of newly inferred topics, etc... An illustration of our approach is presented in Figure 3 and the details are presented in Figure 4.",

        "We show examples of the mined topics with correspondent human labels in Table 3, grouped according to a specific kind of resemblance.",
        "3.4 Summary and Discussion The objective of this section is (1) identifying a category of life events (2) identifying tweets associated with each event type which can be used as candidates for latter self reported personal information and life event category identification.",
        "We understand that the event list retrieved from our approach based on replies in the conversation is far from covering all types of personal events (especially the less frequent life events).",
        "But our 5 We only treat the first sentence that responds to the beginning of the conversation as replies.",

        "Due to the ambiguity in defining life events, the value co-hen's kappa 14 as a measure of inter-rater agreement is 0.54; this does not show significant inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The authors examined disagreements and also verified all positively labeled tweets.",
        "The resulting dataset contains around 900 positive tweets and about 60,000 negative tweets.",
        "To demonstrate the advantage of leveraging large quantities of unlabeled data, the first baseline we investigate is a Supervised model which is trained on the manually annotated labeled dataset, and evaluated using 5 fold cross validation.",
        "Our Supervised baseline consists of a linear SVM classifier using bag of words, NER and POS features.",
        "We also tested a second baseline that combines Supervised algorithm with an our self-reported information classifier, denoted as Super-vised+Self.",

        "The explanations are as follows: (1) the labeled data can only cover a small proportion of life events (2) supervised learning does not separate important event categories and will therefore classify any tweet with highly weighted features (e.g., the mention of ?I?",

        "(3) Data harvesting in Information Extrac-tion, each of which contains large amount of related work, to which we can not do fully justice.",
        "User Information Extraction from Twitter Some early approaches towards understanding user level information on social media is focused on user profile/attribute prediction (e.g.,(Ciot et al., 2013)) user-specific content extraction (Diao 15 which are 24, 38, 42-class classifiers, where 24, 38, 42 denoted the number of topics discovered in each step of bootstrapping (see Figure 5).",
        "2004 et al., 2012; Diao and Jiang, 2013; Li et al., 2014) or user personalization (Low et al., 2011) identification.",
        "The problem of user life event extraction was first studied by Li and Cardie's (2014).",
        "They attempted to construct a chronological timeline for Twitter users from their published tweets based on two criterion: a personal event should be personal and time-specific.",
        "Their system does not explicitly identify a global category of life events (and tweets discussing correspondent event) but identifies the topics/events that are personal and time-specific to a given user using an unsupervised ap-proach, which helps them avoids the nuisance of explicit definition for life event characteristics and acquisition of labeled data.",
        "However, their system has the short-coming that each personal topic needs to be adequately discussed by the user and their followers in order to be detected 16 .",
        "Public Event Extraction from Twitter Twitter serves as a good source for event detection owing to its real time nature and large number of users.",
        "These approaches include identifying bursty public topics (e.g.,(Diao et al., 2012)), topic evolution (Becker et al., 2011) or disaster outbreak (Sakaki et al., 2010; Li and Cardie, 2013) by spotting the increase/decrease of word frequency.",
        "Some other approaches are focused on generating a structured representation of events (Ritter et al., 2012; Benson et al., 2011).",
        "Data Acquisition in Information Extraction Our work is also related with semi-supervised data harvesting approaches, the key idea of which is that some patterns are learned based on seeds.",
        "They are then used to find additional terms, which are subsequently used as new seeds in the patterns to search for additional new patterns (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b; Davidov et al., 2007; Riloff et al., 1999; Igo and Riloff, 2009; Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Also related approaches are distant or weakly supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Craven et al., 1999; Hoffmann et al., 2011) that rely on available structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for pattern extraction from related text corpora.",
        "16 The reason is that topic models use word frequency for topic modeling.",
        "9 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper, we propose a pipelined system for major life event extraction from Twitter.",
        "Experimental results show that our model is able to extract a wide variety of major life events.",
        "The key strategy adopted in this work is to obtain a relatively clean training dataset from large quantity of Twitter data by relying on minimum efforts of human supervision, and sometimes is at the sacrifice of recall.",
        "To achieve this goal, we rely on a couple of restrictions and manual screenings, such as relying on replies, LDA topic identification and seed screening.",
        "Each part of system depends on the early steps.",
        "For example, topic clustering in Section 3 not only offers training data for event identification in Section 4, but prepares the training data for self-information identification in Section 5. .",
        "We acknowledge that our approach is not perfect due to the following ways: (1) The system is only capable of discovering a few categories of life events with many others left unidentified.",
        "(2) Each step of the system will induce errors and negatively affected the following parts.",
        "(3) Some parts of evaluations are not comprehensive due to the lack of gold-standard data.",
        "(4) Among all pipelines, event property identification in Section 6 still requires full supervision in CRF model, making it hard to scale to every event type 17 .",
        "How to address these aspects and generate a more accurate, comprehensive and fine-grained life event list for Twitter users constitute our further work.",
