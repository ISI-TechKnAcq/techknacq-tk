        "The work we present in this paper addresses three issues: evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, the place of aggregation in NLG, and NL interfaces for Intelligent Tutoring Systems.",
        "NLG systems have been evaluated in various ways, such as via task efficacy measures, i.e., measuring how well the users of the system perform on the task at hand (Young, 1999; Carenini and Moore, 2000; Reiter et al., 2003).",
        "We also employed task efficacy, as we evaluated the learning that occurs in students interacting with an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) enhanced with NLG capabilities.",
        "We focused on sentence planning, and specifically, on aggregation.",
        "We developed two different feedback generation engines, that we systematically evaluated in a three way comparison that included the original system as well.",
        "Our work is novel for NLG evaluation in that we focus on one specific component of the NLG process, aggregation.",
        "Aggregation pertains to combining two or more of the messages to be communicated into one sentence (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Whereas it is considered an es",
        "sential task of an NLG system, its specific contributions to the effectiveness of the text that is eventually produced have rarely been assessed (Harvey and Carberry, 1998).",
        "We found that syntactic aggregation does not improve learning, but that what we call functional aggregation does.",
        "Further, we ran a controlled data collection in order to provide a more solid empirical base for aggregation rules than what is normally found in the literature, e.g. (Dalianis, 1996; Shaw, 2002).",
        "As regards NL interfaces for ITSs, research on the next generation of ITSs (Evens et al., 1993; Litman et al., 2004; Graesser et al., 2005) explores NL as one of the keys to bridging the gap between current ITSs and human tutors.",
        "However, it is still not known whether the NL interaction between students and an ITS does in fact improve learning.",
        "We are among the first to show that this is the case.",
        "We will first discuss DIAG, the ITS shell we are using, and the two feedback generators that we developed, DIAG-NLP1 and DIAG-NLP2.",
        "Since the latter is based on a corpus study, we will briefly describe that as well.",
        "We will then discuss the formal evaluation we conducted and our results."

        "The student tests indicators and tries to infer which faulty part (RU) may cause the abnormal states detected via the indicator readings.",

        "There are two main types of queries: Con-sultInd(icator) and ConsultRU.",

        "Our work touches on three issues: aggregation, evaluation of NLG systems, and the role of NL interfaces for ITSs.",
        "In much work on aggregation (Huang and Fiedler, 1996; Horacek, 2002), aggregation rules and heuristics are shown to be plausible, but are not based on any hard evidence.",
        "Even where corpus work is used (Dalianis, 1996; Harvey and Carberry, 1998; Shaw, 2002), the results are not completely convincing because we do not know for certain the content to be communicated from which these texts supposedly have been aggregated.",
        "Therefore, positing empirically based rules is guesswork at best.",
        "Our data collection attempts at providing a more solid empirical base for aggregation rules; we found that tutors exclude significant amounts of factual information, and use high degrees of aggregation based on functionality.",
        "As a consequence, while part of our rules implement standard types of aggregation, such as conjunction via shared participants, we also introduced functional aggregation (see conceptual aggregation (Reape and Mellish, 1998)).",
        "As regards evaluation, NLG systems have been evaluated e.g. by using human judges to assess the quality of the texts produced (Coch, 1996; Lester and Porter, 1997; Harvey and Carberry, 1998); by comparing the system’s performance to that of humans (Yeh and Mellish, 1997); or through task efficacy measures, i.e., measuring how well the users so, and the distribution of topics and of evaluations is too broad to be telling.",
        "of the system perform on the task at hand (Young, 1999; Carenini and Moore, 2000; Reiter et al., 2003).",
        "The latter kind of studies generally contrast different interventions, i.e. a baseline that does not use NLG and one or more variations obtained by parameterizing the NLG system.",
        "However, the evaluation does not focus on a specific component of the NLG process, as we did here for aggregation.",
        "Regarding the role of NL interfaces for ITSs, only very recently have the first few results become available, to show that first of all, students do learn when interacting in NL with an ITS (Litman et al., 2004; Graesser et al., 2005).",
        "However, there are very few studies like ours, that evaluate specific features of the NL interaction, e.g. see (Litman et al., 2004).",
        "In our case, we did find that different features of the NL feedback impact learning.",
        "Although we contend that this effect is due to functional aggregation, the feedback in DIAG-NLP2 changed along other dimensions, mainly using referents of indicators instead of indicators, and being more strongly directive in suggesting what to do next.",
        "Of course, we cannot argue that our best NL generator is equivalent to a human tutor – e.g., dividing the number of ConsultRU and ConsultInd reported in Sec. 2.2 by the number of dialogues shows that students ask about 10 Con-sultRus and 1.5 ConsultInd per dialogue when interacting with a human, many fewer than those they pose to the ITSs (cf. Table 2) (regrettably we did not administer a PostTest to students in the human data collection).",
        "We further discuss the implications of our results for NL interfaces for ITSs in a companion paper (Di Eugenio et al., 2005).",
        "The DIAG project has come to a close.",
        "We are satisfied that we demonstrated that even not overly sophisticated NL feedback can make a difference; however, the fact that DIAG-NLP2 has the best language and engenders the most learning prompts us to explore more complex language interactions.",
        "We are pursuing new exciting directions in a new domain, that of basic data structures and algorithms.",
        "We are investigating what distinguishes expert from novice tutors, and we will implement our findings in an ITS that tutors in this domain.",
