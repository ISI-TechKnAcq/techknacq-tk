        "A metagrammar (MG) factors common properties of TAG elementary trees to avoid redundancy, ease grammar development, and expand coverage with minimal effort: typically, from a compact manually encoded MG of a few dozen classes, one or more TAGs with several hundreds of elementary trees are automatically generated.",
        "This is appealing from a grammar engineering point of view, and also from a linguistic point of view: cross-linguistic generalizations are expressed directly in the MG.",
        "In this paper, we extend some earlier work on multilingual MGs (Candito, 1998; Kinyon and Rambow, 2003) by proposing cross-linguistic and framework-neutral syntactic invariants, which we apply to TAG.",
        "We focus on the verb-second phenomenon as a prototypical example of cross-language variation.",
        "The notion of Metagrammar Metagrammars were first introduced by Candito (1996) to manually encode syntactic knowledge in a compact and abstract class hierarchy which supports multiple inheritance, and from which a TAG is automatically generated offline.",
        "Candito’s class hierarchy imposes a general organization of syntax into three dimensions: Dimension 1: to encode initial subcategorization frames i.e. TAG tree families Dimension 2: to encode valency alternations / redistribution of syntactic functions Dimension 3: to encode the surface realization of arguments.",
        "Each class in the MG hierarchy is associated with a partial tree description The tool computes a set of well-formed classes by combining exactly one terminal class from dimension 1, one terminal class from dimension 2, and terminal classes from dimensions 3 ( being the number of arguments subcategorized by the lexical head anchoring the elementary tree(s) generated).",
        "The conjunction of the tree descriptions associated with each well-formed class in the set yields a minimal satisfying description, which results in the generation of one or more elementary trees.",
        "Candito’s tool was used to develop a large TAG for French as well as a medium-size TAG for Italian Candito (1999), so multilinguality was addressed from the start, but each language had its dedicated hierarchy, with no sharing of classes despite the obvious similarities between Italian and French.",
        "A related approach was proposed by (Xia, 2001); the work of Evans, Gazdar, and Weir (2000) also has some common elements with MG.",
        "Framework and language-neutral syntactic invariants Using a MG, and following Candito, we can postulate cross-linguistic and cross-framework syntactic invariants such as:",
        "Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms, pages 17 –24, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics The notion of subcategorization The existence of a finite number of syntactic functions (subject, object etc.)",
        "The existence of a finite number of syntactic categories (NP, PP, etc.)",
        "The existence of valency alternations (Can-dito’s dimension 2) The existence, orthogonal to valency alternations, of syntactic phenomena which do not alter valency, such as wh-movement (Can-dito’s dimension 3).",
        "These invariants – unlike other framework-specific syntactic assumptions such as the existence of “movement” or “wh-traces” – are accepted by most if not all existing frameworks, even though the machinery of a given framework may not necessarily account explicitly for each invariant.",
        "For instance, TAG does not have an explicit notion of syntactic function: although by convention node indices tend to reflect a function, it is not enforced by the framework’s machinery.1 Hypertags Based on such framework and language-neutral syntactic properties, Kinyon (2000) defined the notion of Hypertag (HT), a combination of Supertags (ST) Srinivas (1997) and of the MG. A ST is a TAG elementary tree, which provides richer information than standard POS tagging, but in a framework-specific manner (TAG), and also in a grammar-specific manner since a ST tagset can’t be ported from one TAG to another TAG.",
        "A HT is an abstraction of STs, where the main syntactic properties of any given ST is encoded in a general readable Feature Structure (FS), by recording which MG classes a ST inherited from when it was generated.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the ST, HT pair for Par qui sera accompagn´ee Marie ‘By whom will Mary be accompanied’.",
        "We see that a HT feature structure directly reflects the MG organization, by having 3 features “Dimension 1”, “Dimension 2” and “Dimension 3”, where each feature takes its value from the MG terminal classes used to generate a given ST.",
        "The XMG Tool Candito’s tool brought a significant linguistic insight, therefore we essentially retain the above-mentioned syntactic invariants.",
        "However, more recent MG implementations have been developed since, each adding its significant contribution to the underlying metagrammatical hypothesis.",
        "In this paper, we use the eXtensible MetaGram-mar (XMG) tool which was developed by Crabb´e",
        "(2005).",
        "In XMG, an MG consists of a set of classes similar to those in object-oriented programming, which are structured into a multiple inheritance hierarchy.",
        "Each class specifies a partial tree description (expressed by dominance and precedence constraints).",
        "The nodes of these tree fragment descriptions may be annotated with features.",
        "Classes may instantiate each other, and they may be parametrized (e.g., to hand down features like the grammatical function of a substitution node).",
        "The compiler unifies the instantiations of tree descriptions that are called.",
        "This unification is additionally guided by node colors, constraints that specify that a node must not be unified with any other node (red), must be unified (white), or may be unified, but only with a white node (black).",
        "XMG allows us to implement a hierarchy similar to that of Candito, but it also allows us to modify and extend it, as no structural assumptions about the class hierarchy are hard-coded."

        "We claim that what governs the appearance of the verb in these different positions (and thus the cross-linguistic differences) is that the heads – the verbal head and functional heads such as auxiliaries and complementizers – interact in specific ways.",
        "For example, in German a complementizer is not compatible with a verbal V2 head, while in Yiddish it is.",
        "We express the interaction among heads by assigning the heads different values for a set of features.",

        "Thus, we reinterpret Candito’s “Dimension 3” to concentrate on the position of the verbal heads, with the different argument realizations (topicalized, base position) depending on the available heads, rather than defined as first-class citizens.",
        "The sub-cat and argument redistributions result in a set of structures for arguments which are left or right-branching (depending on language and grammatical function).",
        "Figure 2 shows some argument structures for German.",
        "The topology reflects the basic clause structure, that is, the distribution of arguments and adjuncts, and the position of the verb (initial, V2, final, etc.).",
        "Our notion of sentence topology is thus similar to the notion formalized by Gerdes (2002).",
        "Specifically, we see positions of arguments and adjuncts as defined by the positions of their verbal heads.",
        "However, while Gerdes (2002) assumes as basic underlying notions the fields created by the heads (the traditional Vorfeld for the topicalized element and the Mittelfeld between the verb in second position and the verb in clause-final position), we only use properties of the heads.",
        "The fields are epiphenomenal for us.As mentioned above, we use the following set of features to define our MG topology: I (finite tense and subject-verb agreement): creates a specifier position for agreement which must be filled in a derivation, but allows recursion (i.e., adjunction at IP).",
        "Top (topic): a feature which creates a specifier position for the topic (semantically represented in a lambda abstraction) which must be filled in a derivation, and which does not allow recursion.",
        "M (mood): a feature with semantic content (to be defined), but no specifier.",
        "C (complementizer): a lexical feature introduced only by complementizers.",

        "It consists of two main parts:",
        "The projection includes the origin of the verb in the phrase structure (with an empty head since we assume it is no longer there) and its maximal projection.",
        "It is shown in Figure 3.",
        "The maximal projection expresses the expected feature content.",
        "For example, if we want to model non-finite clauses, the maximal projection will have[ I], while root V2 clauses will have [+Top], and embedded finite clauses with complementizers will have [+I,+C].",

        "Two such lists are shown in Figure 4, for German and Yiddish.",
        "The corresponding head structures are shown in Figures 5 and 6.",
        "A topology is a combination of the projection and any combination of heads allowed by the language-specific head inventory.",

        "This allows not only the reuse of MG parts for new (often, not well-studied) languages, but it also enables us to study small-scale parametric variation between languages in a controlled and formal way.",
        "We are currently modifying and extending our implementation in several ways.",
        "The Notion of Projection In our current approach, the verb is never at the basis of the projection, it has always been removed into a new location.",
        "This may seem unmotivated in certain cases, such as German verb-final sentences.",
        "We are looking into using the XMG unification to actually place the verb at the bottom of the projection in these cases.",
        "Generating Top and Bottom Features The generated TAG grammar currently does not have top and bottom feature sets, as one would expect in a feature-based TAG.",
        "These are important for us so we can force adjunction in adjunct-initial V2 sentences (where the element in clause-initial position is not an argument of the verb).",
        "We intend to follow the approach laid out in Crabb´e (2005) in order to generate top and bottom feature structures on the nodes of the TAG grammar.",
        "Generating test-suites to document our grammars Since XMG offers more complex object-oriented functionalities, including instances, and therefore recursion, it is now straightforward to directly generate parallel multilingual sentences directly from XMG, without any intermediate grammar generation step.",
        "The only obstacle remains the explicit encoding of Hypertags into XMG."
