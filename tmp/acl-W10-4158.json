        "For this task, we propose a Jumping-Distance based n-gram model (abbr.",
        "DJ n-gram) to describe the semantics of the closest contexts of the target person-name strings.",
        "The generation of the DJ n-gram model mainly involves two steps.",
        "First, we mine the Jumping tree for the target string; second, we give the statistical description of the tree.",
        "• Jumping Tree",
        "Given a target string, we firstly extract the sentence where it locates as its closest context.",
        "Then we segment the sentence into n-grams(Chen et al.",
        ",2009) (only Bi-gram and Tri-gram are used in this paper).",
        "For each n-gram, we regard it as the beginning of a jumping journey.",
        "And the places where we jump are the sentences which involve the n-gram.",
        "By the same way, we segment the sentences into n-grams which will be regarded as the new beginnings to open further jumping.",
        "The procedure will run iteratively until there are no sentences in the",
        "1 Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.",
        "60970057, No.60873105.",
        "document (viz. the document which involves the target string) can be used to jump.",
        "Actually, we find there are only 3 jumps in average in our previous test and simultaneously 11 sentences in a document can be involved into the jumping journey.",
        "Thus, we can obtain a Jumping Tree where each jumping route from the initially n-gram (viz. the gram in the closes context) refer to a branch.",
        "And for each intermediate node, its child-nodes are the n-grams co-occurred with it in the same sentences.",
        "The motivation to generate the Jumping Tree is to imitate the thinking model of human recognizing the word senses and semantics.",
        "In detail, for each intermediate node of the tree, its child-nodes all come from its closest contexts, especially the nodes co-occur with it in the same sentences which involve the real grammar and semantic relations.",
        "Thus the child-nodes normally provide the natural inference for its word sense.",
        "For example, given the string \"SARS\", we can deduce its sense from its child nodes \"Severe\", \"Acute\", \"Respiratory\" and \"Syndromes\" even if we see the string for the first time.",
        "On the basis, the procedure of inference run iteratively, that is, the tree always use the child nodes deduce the meaning of their father nodes then further ancestor nodes until the root.",
        "Thus the tree acts as a hierarchical understanding procedure.",
        "Additionally, the distances among nodes in the tree give the degree of semantic relation.",
        "In the task of person-name disambiguation, we use the Jumping Tree to deduce the identities and backgrounds of a person.",
        "Each branch of the tree refers to a property of the person.",
        "• Jumping-Distance based n-gram model",
        "In this paper, we give a simple statistical model to describe the Jumping Tree.",
        "Given a node in the tree (viz. an n-gram), we record the steps jumping from the root to it, viz. the depth of the node in the tree.",
        "Then based on the priori-trained TFIDF value, we calculate the generation probability of the node as follows:",
        "where the a denotes the smoothing factor.",
        "In fact, we create more comprehensive models to describe the semantic correlations among the nodes in the Jumping Tree.",
        "The models well use the distances among the nodes in local Jumping Tree (viz. the tree generated based on the test document) and that normalized on the large-scale training data to calculate the probability of n-grams correboratively generate a semantics.",
        "They try to imitate the thinking model of human combine differents features to understand panoramic knowledge.",
        "In the task of name disambiguation, we can use the models to improve the distinguishment of different persons who have the same name.",
        "And we have illustrate the well effectiveness on the topic description and relevance measurement in other tasks, such as Link Detection.",
        "But we actually didn't use the models to perform the task of name diaambiguation this time with the aim to purely evaluate the usefulness of the Jumping Tree."

        "For the task of Chinese person name disambiguation, we submitted two systems as follows: • System1",
        "The system involves two main components: DJ-based name Identification error detection and DJ-based person name disambiguation.",
        "The first component, viz. DJ-based name segmentation error detection, aims to distinguish the target string referring to person name from that referring to something else.",
        "Such as, the string \"MM?'",
        "can be a person name \"Hai Huang\" but also a name of sea \"the Yellow Sea\".",
        "And the detection component focuses on obtaining the pure person name \"Hai Huang\".",
        "The detection component firstly establish two classes of features which respectively describe the nature of human and that of things.",
        "Such as, the features \"professor\", \"research\", \"honest\" et al., can roughly be determined as the nature of human, and conversely the features \"solid\", \"collapse\", \"deep\" et al., can be that of things.",
        "For obtaining the features, we extract 10,000 documents that discuss person, eg.",
        "\"Albert Einstein\" and 6000 documents that discuss technology, science, geography, et.al., from Wikipedia.",
        "For each document, we generate its Jumping Tree, and regard the nodes in the tree as the features.",
        "After that, we combine the weights of the same features and normalized the value by dividing that by the average weight in the specific class of features.",
        "Based on the two classes of features, given a target string and the document where it occurs, the detection component firstly generate the Jumping Tree of the document, and then determines whether the string is person name or things by measuring the similarity of the tree to the classes of features.",
        "Here, we simply use the VSM and Cosine metric ( Bagga and Baldwin, 1998 ) to obtain the similarity.",
        "The second component, viz. DJ-based person name disambiguation, firstly generates the Jumping trees for all documents that involve specific person name.",
        "And a two-stage clustering algorithm is adopted to divide the documents and refer each cluster to a person.",
        "The first stage of the algorithm runs a strict division which focuses on obtaining high precision.",
        "The second stage performs a soft division which is used to improve recall.",
        "The two-stage clustering algorithm(Ikeda et al.,2009) initially obtains the optimal parameters that respectively refer to the maximum precision and recall based on training data, and then regards a statistical tradeoff as the final value of the parameters.",
        "Here, the Affinity Propagation clustering tools (Frey BJ and Dueck D, 2007) is in use.",
        "• System2",
        "The system is similar to the system1 except that it additionally involve Named Entity Identification (Artiles et.al,2009B; Popescu,O.",
        "and Magnini, B.,2007)before the two-stage clustering in the component of person name disambiguation.",
        "In detail, given a person name and the documents that it occurs in, the disambiguation component of System2 firstly adopt NER CRF++ toolkit provided by MSRA to identify Named Entities(Chen et al., 2006) that involve the given name string, such as the entity \"^yif BJJ\" (viz. Gao-ming Li in English) when given the target name string \"/if^/\"(viz. Ming Gao in English).",
        "Thus the documents can be roughly divided into different clusters of Named Entities without name segmentation errors.",
        "After that, we additionally adopt the two-stage clustering algorithm to further divide each cluster.",
