        "We present an overview of the first shared task on language identification on codeswitched data.",
        "The shared task included code-switched data from four language pairs: Modern Standard Arabic-Dialectal Arabic (MSA-DA), Mandarin-English (MAN-EN), Nepali-English (NEP- EN), and Spanish-English (SPA-EN).",
        "A total of seven teams participated in the task and submitted 42 system runs.",
        "The evaluation showed that language identification at the token level is more difficult when the languages present are closely related, as in the case of MSA-DA, where the prediction performance was the lowest among all language pairs.",
        "In contrast, the language pairs with the higest F-measure where SPA-EN and NEP-EN.",
        "The task made evident that language identification in code-switched data is still far from solved and warrants further research."

        "The main goal of this language identification shared task is to increase awareness of the outstanding challenges in the automated processing of Code-Switched (CS) data and motivate more research in this direction.",
        "We define CS broadly as a communication act, whether spoken or written, where two or more languages are being used interchangeably.",
        "In its spoken form, CS has probably been around ever since different languages first came in contact.",
        "Linguists have studied this phenomenon since the mid 1900s.",
        "In contrast, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has only recently started to pay attention to CS, with the earliest work in this area dating back to Joshi's theoretical work proposing an approach to parsing CS data (Joshi, 1982) based on the Matrix and Embedded language framework.",
        "With the wide-spread use of social me-dia, CS is now being used more and more in written language and thus we are seeing an increase in published papers dealing with CS.",
        "We are specifically interested in intrasentential code switched phenomena.",
        "As a result of this task, we have successfully created the first set of annotated data for several language pairs with a coherent set of labels across the languages.",
        "As the shared task results show, CS poses new research questions that warrant new NLP approaches, and thus we expect to see a significant increase in NLP work in the coming years addressing CS phenomena in data.",
        "The shared task covers four language pairs and is focused on social media data.",
        "We provided participants with annotated data from Twitter for the 62 language pairs: Modern Standard Arabic-Arabic dialects (MSA-DA), Mandarin-English (MAN- EN), NEP-EN (NEP-EN), and SPA-EN (SPA-EN).",
        "These language pairs represent a good variety in terms of language typology and relatedness among pairs.",
        "They also cover languages with different representation in terms of number of speakers world wide.",
        "Participants were asked to make predictions on unseen Twitter data for each language pair.",
        "We also provided participants with test data from a ?surprise genre?",
        "with the objective of assessing the robustness of language identification systems to genre variation.",
        "2 Task Description The task consists of labeling each token/word in the input file with one of six labels: lang1, lang2, other, ambiguous, mixed, and named entities NE.",
        "The lang1, lang2 labels refer to the two languages addressed in the subtask, for example for the language pair MSA-DA, lang1 would be an MSA and lang2 is DA.",
        "The other category is a label used to tag all punctuation marks, emoticons, numbers, and similar tokens that do not represent actual words in any of the given languages.",
        "The ambiguous label is for instances where it is not possible to assign a language with certainty, for example, a lexical form that belongs to both languages, appearing in a context that does not indicate one language over the other.",
        "The mixed category is for words composed of CS morphemes, such as the word snapchateando ?to chat?",
        "from SPA-EN, the word overai from NEP-EN, or the word hayqwlwn 1 ?they will say?, from MSA-DA, where the ?ha?",
        "is a DA future morpheme and the stem ?yqwlwn?",
        "is MSA.The NE label is included in this task in an effort to allow for a more focused analysis of CS data with the exclusion of proper nouns.",
        "NEs have a very different behavior than most other words in a language vocabulary and thus from our perspective they need to be identified to be handled properly.",
        "Table 1 shows Twitter examples taken from the training data.",
        "The annotation guidelines are posted on the workshop website 2 .",
        "We post the ones used for SPA-EN as for the other language pairs the only differences are the examples provided.",

        "3 Related Work In the past, most language identification research has been done at the document level.",
        "Some re-searchers, however, have developed methods to identify languages within multilingual documents (Singh and Gorla, 2007; Nguyen and Do?gru?oz, 2013; King and Abney, 2013).",
        "Their test data comes from a variety of sources, including web pages, bilingual forum posts, and jumbled data from monolingual sources, but none of them are trained on code-switched data, opting instead for a monolingual training set per language.",
        "This could prove to be a problem when working on codeswitched data, particularly in shorter samples such as social media data, as the code-switching context is not present in training material.",
        "One system tackled both the problems of code-switching and social media in language and codeswitched status identification (Lignos and Marcus, 2013).",
        "Lignos and Marcus gathered millions of monolingual tweets in both English and Spanish in order to model the two languages, and used crowdsourcing to annotate tens of thousands of Spanish tweets, approximately 11% of which contained code-switched content.",
        "This system was able to achieve 96.9% word-level accuracy and a 0.936 F-measure in identifying code-switched tweets.",
        "The issue still stands that relatively little code-switching data, such as that used in Lignos and 63 Marcus?",
        "research, is readily available.",
        "Even in their data, the percentage of code-switched tweets was barely over a tenth of the total test data.",
        "There have been other corpora built, particularly for other language pairs such as Mandarin-English (Li et al., 2012; Lyu et al., 2010), but the amount of data available and the percentage of code-switching data within that data are not up to the standards of other areas of the natural language processing field.",
        "With this in mind, we sought to provide corpora for multiple language pairs, each with a better distribution of code-switching phenomena.",
        "4 Data Sets Most of the data for the shared task comes form Twitter.",
        "However, we also collected and annotated data from other social media sources, including Facebook, web forums, and blogs.",
        "These additional sources of data were used as the surprise data.",
        "In this section we describe briefly the corpora curated for the shared task.",
        "Language-pair Training Test Surprise MAN-EN 1000 313 n/a MSA-DA 5,838 2332, 1,777 12,017 NEP-EN 9,993 3,018 (2,874) 1,087 SPA-EN 11,400 3,060 (1,626) 1,102 Table 2: Statistics of the shared task data sets per language pairs.",
        "The numbers are according to what was actually annotated, numbers in parenthesis show what the participating systems were able to crawl from Twitter.",
        "The Surprise genre comes from various sources, other than Twitter.",
        "Table 2 shows some statistics about the different datasets used in this task.",
        "We strive to provide dataset sizes that would allow a robust analysis of results.",
        "However, an unexpected challenge was the rate at which tweets became unavailable.",
        "Different language pairs had different attrition rates with SPA-EN being the most affected language and MSA-DA and NEP-EN the least affected.",
        "Note that we provided two test datasets for MSA-DA.",
        "Since we separated the data on a per user basis, the first test set had a highly skewed distribution.",
        "The second test set was distributed to participants to allow a comparison with a data set having a class distribution more similar to the training set.",
        "4.1 SPA-EN data Developing the corpus involved two primary steps: locating code-switching tweets and using crowdsourcing to annotate their tokens with language tags.",
        "A small portion of the tweets were annotated in-lab and this was used as the gold data for quality control in the crowdsourcing annotation.",
        "To avoid biasing the data used in this task, we used a two step process to select the tweets: first we identified CS tweets by doing a keyword search on Twitter's API.",
        "We selected a few frequently used English words and restricted the search to tweets identified by Twitter as Spanish from users in California and Texas.",
        "An additional set of tweets was then collected by using frequent Spanish words in an all English tweet, from users in the same locations.",
        "We filtered these tweets to remove tweets containing URLs, duplicates, spam tweets and retweets.",
        "In-lab annotators labeled the filtered tweets using the guidelines referenced above.",
        "From this set of labeled data we then ranked the users in this set by the percentage of CS tweets.",
        "We selected the 12 most prolific CS users and then pulled all of their available tweets.",
        "These 12 users contributed the tweets used in the shared task.",
        "The tweets were labeled using CrowdFlower 3 .",
        "After analyzing the number and content distribution of the tweets, the SPA-EN data was split into a 11,400 tweet training set and a 3,014 tweet test set.",
        "The SPA-EN Surprise Genre (SPA-EN-SG) included Facebook comments from the Veteranas community 4 and the Chicanas community 5 and blog data from the Albino Bean 6 .",
        "Data was collected using Python scripts that implemented the Beautiful Soup library and the third-party Python Facebook SDK (for Blogger and Facebook respec-tively).",
        "Post and comment IDs were used to identify Facebook posts, and URLs were used to identify Blogger posts.",
        "The collected posts were formatted to match those collected from Twitter.",
        "In-lab annotators were used to annotate approximately 1K tokens.",
        "All the data we collected in this manner was released as surprise data to all participants.",
        "4.2 NEP-EN data The collection of NEP-EN data followed a similar approach to that of SPA-EN.",
        "We first focused on finding users that switched frequently between 3 http://www.crowdflower.com/ 4 https://www.facebook.com/ VeteranaPinup 5 https://www.facebook.com/pages/ Chicanas/444483772293893 6 http://thealbinobean.blogspot.com/ 64 Nepali and English.",
        "In addition, the users must not be using Devnagari script as done by Nepalese to write Nepali, but must have used its Romanized form.",
        "We started by manually reading tweets from some of our Nepali friends.",
        "We then crawled their followers who corresponded with them using code-switched tweets or replies.",
        "We found that a lot of these users were regular code-switchers themselves.",
        "We repeated the same process with the followers and collected nearly 30 such users.",
        "We then collected about 2,000 tweets each from these users using the Twitter API.",
        "We filtered out all the retweets and the tweets with URLs, following the same process that was used for SPA-EN.",
        "For the surprise test data, we crawled codeswitched data from Facebook comments and posts.",
        "We found that most Nepalese comments had a rich amount of code-switched data.",
        "However, we could not crawl their data because of privacy issues.",
        "Nev-ertheless, we could crawl data from public Facebook pages.",
        "We identified some public Nepali Facebook pages where anyone could comment.",
        "These pages include FM, news and public figures?",
        "public Facebook pages.",
        "We crawled the latest 10 feeds from these public pages using the Facebook API and gathered about 12,000 comments and posts for the shared task.",
        "Initially, we sought out help from Nepali graduate students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to annotate 100 tweets (1739 tokens).",
        "We gave the same annotation file to two annotators to do the annotation.",
        "We found that they agreed with an accuracy of 95.34%.",
        "These tweets were then reviewed and used as initial gold data in Crowdflower to annotate the first 1000 tweets.",
        "The annotation job was enabled only in Nepal and Bhutan.",
        "We disabled India, even though people living in some regions of India (Darjeeling, Sikkim) also speak and write in Nepali, as most spammers were coming from India.",
        "We then ran two batches of 5000 tweets and one batch of 3000 tweets along with the initial 1,000 tweets as the gold data.",
        "This NEP-EN data was then split into a 9,993 tweet training set and a 2,874 tweet test set.",
        "No Twitter user appeared in both sets.",
        "4.3 MAN-EN data The MAN-EN tweets were collected from Twitter with the Twitter API.",
        "Users were selected from lists of most followed Twitter accounts in Taiwan (where Mandarin Chinese is the official language).",
        "These users?",
        "tweets were checked for Mandarin English bilingualism and added to our data collection if they contained both languages.",
        "The next round of usernames came from the lists of users that our original top accounts were following.",
        "The tweets written by this new set of users were then examined for Mandarin English code switching and stored as data if they matched the criteria.",
        "The jieba tokenizer 7 was used to segment the Mandarin sections of the tweets and compute offsets of each segment.",
        "We format the code switching tweets into columns including language type, labels, and offsets.",
        "Named entities were labeled manually by a single annotator.",
        "The data was split by user into 1000 tweets for training and 313 for testing.",
        "No MAN-EN surprise data for the current shared task.",
        "4.4 MSA-DA data For the MSA-DA language pair, we selected Egyptian Arabic (EGY) as the Arabic dialect.",
        "We harvested data from two social media sources: Twitter [TWT] and Blog commentaries [COM].",
        "The TWT data served as the main gold standard data for the task where we provided fully annotated data for Training/Tuning and Test.",
        "We provided two TWT data sets for the test data that exemplified different tag distributions.",
        "The COM data set comprised only test data and it served as the Arabic surprise data set.",
        "To reduce the potential of TWT data attrition from users deleting their accounts or tweets, we selected tweets that are less prone to deletion and/or change.",
        "Thereby we harvested tweets by a select set of Egyptian Public Figures.",
        "The percentage of deleted tweets and deactivated accounts among those users is significantly lower if we compare it to the tweets crawled from random Egyptian users.",
        "We used the ?Tweepy?",
        "library to crawl the time-lines of 12 Public Figures.",
        "Similar to other language pairs, we excluded all re-tweets, tweets with URLs, tweets mentioning other users, and tweets containing Latin characters.",
        "We accepted 9,947 tweets, for each we extracted the tweet-id and user-id.",
        "Using these IDs, we retrieved the tweets text, tokenized it and assigned character offsets.",
        "To guarantee consistency and avoid any misalignment is-sues, we compiled the full pipeline into the ?Arabic Tweets Token Assigner?",
        "package which is made 7 https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba 65 available through the workshop website 8 .",
        "For COM, we selected 6723 commentaries (half MSA and half DA) from ?youm7?",
        "9 commentaries provided by the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011).",
        "The COM data set was processed (12017 total tokens) using the same pipeline created for the task.",
        "We also provided the participants with the data formatted with character offsets to maintain consistency across data sets in the Arabic subtask.",
        "The annotation of MSA-DA language pair data is based on two sets of guidelines.",
        "The first set is a generic set of guidelines for code switching in general across different language pairs.",
        "These guidelines provide the overarching framework for annotating code switched data on the morpholog-ical, lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic levels.",
        "The second set of guidelines is language pair specific.",
        "We created the guidelines for the Arabic language specifically.",
        "We enlisted the help of 3 annotators in addition to a super annotator, hence resulting in 4 annotators overall for the whole collection of the data.",
        "All the annotators are native speakers of Egyptian Arabic with excellent proficiency in MSA.",
        "The super annotator only annotated 10% of the overall data and served as the adjudicator.",
        "The annotation process was iterative with several repetitions of the cycle of training, annotation, revision, adjudication until we approached a stable Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) of over 90% pairwise agreement.",
        "5 Survey of Shared Task Systems We received submissions from seven different teams.",
        "Each participating system had the freedom to submit responses to any of the language pairs covered in the shared task.",
        "All seven participants submitted system responses for SPA-EN, making this language pair the most popular in this shared task and MAN-EN the least popular.",
        "All but one participating system used a machine learning algorithm or language models, or even a combination of both, as part of their configuration.",
        "A couple of the participating systems used hand-crafted rules of some sort, either at the intermediate steps or as the final post-processing step.",
        "We also observed a good number of systems using external resources, in the form of labeled monolingual 8 http://emnlp2014.org/workshops/ CodeSwitch/call.html 9 An Egyptian newspaper, www.youm7.com corpora, language specific gazetteers, off the shelf tools (NE recognizers, language id systems, or morphological analyzers) and even unsupervised data crawled from the same users present in the data sets provided.",
        "Affixes were also used in some form by different systems.",
        "The architecture of the different systems ranged from a simple approach based on frequencies of character n-grams combined in a rule-based system, to more complex approaches using word embed-dings, extended Markov Models, and CRF autoen-coders.",
        "The majority of the systems that participated in more than one language pair did little to no customization to account for the morphological differences of the specific language pairs beyond language specific parameter-tuning, which probably reflects participants?",
        "goal to develop a multilingual id system.",
        "Due to the presence of the NE label, several systems included a component for NE recognition where there was one available for the specific language.",
        "In addition, many systems also included case information.",
        "One unexpected finding from the shared task was that no participating system tried to embed in their models some form of linguistic theory or framework about CS.",
        "Only one system made an explicit reference to CS theories (Chittaranjan et al., 2014) in their motivation to use contextual information, which can be considered as a loose embedding of CS theory.",
        "While system performance was competitive (see next section), there is still room for improvement and perhaps some of that improvement can come out of adding this kind of knowledge into the models.",
        "Lastly, we were surprised to see that not all systems made use of character encoding information, even though for Mandarin-English that would have been a strong indicator.",
        "In Table 3 we present a summary highlighting some of the design choices of participating systems.",
        "6 Results We used the following evaluation metrics: Accu-racy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure.",
        "We use F-measure to provide a ranking of systems.",
        "In the evaluation at the tweet level we use the standard f-measure.",
        "For the evaluation at the token level we use instead the average weighted f-measure to account for the highly imbalanced distribution of classes.",
        "To provide a fair evaluation, we only scored pre-66 System Machine Learning Rules Case Character Encoding External Resources LM Affixes Context (Chittaranjan et al., 2014) CRF 4 4 dbpedia dumps, online sources ?",

        "All systems were compared to a simple lexicon-based baseline.",
        "The lexicon was gathered from the training data for classes lang1 and lang2 only.",
        "Emoti-cons, punctuation marks, usernames and URLs are by default tagged as other.",
        "In the case of a tie or a new token, the baseline system assigns the majority class for that language pair.",
        "Figure 1 shows prediction performance on the Twitter test data for each language pair at the tweet level.",
        "The system predictions for this task are taken directly from the individual token predictions in the following manner: if the system predictions for the same tweet contain at least one tag from each language (lang1 and lang2), the tweet is labeled as code-switched, otherwise it is labeled as monolingual.",
        "As illustrated, each language pair shows different patterns.",
        "Comparing the systems that participated in all language pairs, there is no clear winner across the board.",
        "However, (Chittaranjan et al., 2014) was in the top three places in at least one test file for each language pair.",
        "Table 4 shows the results at the token level by label.",
        "Here again the figures show F-measure per class label and the last column is the weighted average f-measure (Avg-F).",
        "One of the few general trends on these results is that most participating systems were not able to correctly identify the minority classes ?ambiguous?",
        "and ?other?.",
        "There are only few instances of these labels in the training set and some test sets did not have one of these classes present.",
        "The impact on final system performance from these classes is not significant.",
        "However, to study CS patterns we will need to have these labels identified properly.",
        "The MAN-EN pair received four system responses and all four of them reached an F-measure >80% and outperformed the simple baseline by a considerable margin.",
        "We expected this language pair to be the easiest one for the shared task since each language uses a different encoding script.",
        "A very rough but accurate distinction between Mandarin and English could be achieved by looking at the character encoding.",
        "However, according to the system descriptions provided, not all systems used encoding information.",
        "The best performing systems for MAN-EN are (King et al., 2014) and (Chittaranjan et al., 2014).",
        "The former slightly outperformed the latter at the Tweet level (see Figure 1a) task while the opposite was true at the token level (see Table 4 rows 4 and 5).",
        "In the case of SPA-EN, all seven systems outperformed the simple baseline.",
        "The best performing system in all SPA-EN tasks was (Bar and Dershowitz, 2014).",
        "This system achieved an F-measure of 82.2%, 2.9 percentage points above the second best system (Lin et al., 2014) on the tweet level task (see Figure 1(d)).",
        "In the token level evaluation, (Bar and Dershowitz, 2014) reached an Avg.",
        "F-measure of 94%.",
        "This top performing system uses a sequential classification approach where the labels from the preceding words are used as features in the model.",
        "Another design choice that might have given the edge to this system is the fact that their model combines character- and word-based language models in what the authors call ?intra- and inter-word level?",
        "features.",
