        "The information extraction task has proved to be difficult for a variety of domains (Riloff, 1995).",
        "The extracted information can further be used for question answering, information retrieval and other applications.",
        "Depending on the final purpose, the extracted information can be of different type, e.g., temporal events, locations, etc.",
        "The information corresponding to locations and names, is referred to as the information about named entities.",
        "Hence, named entity recognition constitutes a subtask of the information extraction in general.",
        "It is especially challenging to extract the named entities from the text sources written in languages other than English which, in practice, is supported by the results of the shared tasks on the named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002).",
        "Named entity recognition for the languages with a rich morphology and a free word order is difficult because of several reasons.",
        "The entropy of texts in such languages is usually higher than the entropy of English texts.",
        "It is either needed to use such resources as morphological analyzers to reduce the data sparseness or to annotate a large amount of data in order to obtain a good performance.",
        "Luckily, the free word order is not crucial for the named entity recognition task as the local context of a named entity should be sufficient for its detection.",
        "Besides, a free word order usually implies a free order of constituents (such as noun phrases or verb phrases) rather than words as such.",
        "For instance, although is grammatically correct and can occur in the data, it would be less frequent than (2).",
        "(1) nepBony Bona Tpinwae kbItky red she holds flower she holds a red flower",
        "(2) Bona TpiiMae nepBony KBiTKy she holds red flower she holds a red flower",
        "The first phrase exemplifies that an adjective 'nepBony' is in a focus, whereas the second reflects the word order which is more likely to occur.",
        "In terms of named entities, an entity consisting of several words is also less likely to be split (consider, e.g., National saw she Bank where 'National Bank' represents one named entity of type organization).",
        "In the newspaper corpus we annotated, we have observed no examples of split named entities.",
        "In this paper, we study different data representation and machine learning methods to extract the named entities from text.",
        "Our goal is two-fold.",
        "First,",
        "'all examples in the paper are in Ukrainian, for convenience translated and sometimes transliterated",
        "we explore the possibility of using patterns induced from the data gathered on the Web.",
        "We also consider Levenshtein distance to find the most similar instances in the test data given a training set.",
        "Besides, we study the impact of different feature sets on the resulting classification performance.",
        "We start with the short overview of the methods for NER proposed by the IE community.",
        "Afterwards, the experiments are described.",
        "We conclude with the outlook for the future work."

        "The existing NER systems use many sources in order to be able to extract NEs from the text data.",
        "Some of them rely on handwritten rules and precompiled lists of city names, person names and other NEs in a given language, while others explore methods to automatically extract NEs without prior knowledge.",
        "In the first case, the gazetteers will in most cases improve NER results (Carreras et al., 2002) but, unfortunately, they may not exist for a language one is working on.",
        "Hand-written rules can also cover more NEs but building such patterns will be a very time-consuming process.",
        "There have been many methods applied to NER, varying from the statistical to the memory-based approaches.",
        "Most work on NER has been focused on English but there are also approaches to other languages such as Spanish (Kozareva et al., 2005), German, or Dutch.",
        "In addition, several competitions have been organized, with a focus on multilingual NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002).",
        "While analyzing the results of these shared tasks, it can be concluded that the selected features are of a great importance.",
        "In our view, they can be categorized in two types, i.e. contextual and orthographic .",
        "The first type includes words surrounding a given word while the other contains such features as capitalized letters, digits contained within the word, etc.",
        "Both types of features contribute to the information extraction task.",
        "Nevertheless, orthographic features can already be language-specific.",
        "For instance, capitalization is certainly very important for such languages as English or Dutch but it might be less useful for German.",
        "The feature set of some NER methods (Wu, 2002) also includes part-of-speech information and/or word prefixes and suffixes.",
        "Although this information (and especially lemmas) is very useful for the languages with rich morphology, it presupposes the existence of POS taggers for a given language.",
        "Another conclusion which can be drawn relates to the machine learning approaches.",
        "The best results have been received by applying ensemble methods (Wu, 2002; Florian, 2002; Carreras et al., 2002).",
        "A very interesting work on named entity recognition task was reported by Collins et al.",
        "(1999) who used only few named entities to bootstrap more.",
        "The other approach proposed recently makes use of the data extracted from the Web (Talukdar et al., 2006).",
        "By restricting themselves to the fixed context of the extracted named entities and by employing grammar inference techniques, the authors filter out the most useful patterns.",
        "As they show, by applying such approach precision can already be largely boosted.",
        "Pastra et al.",
        "(2002) focused on the applicability of already existing resources in one language to another.",
        "Their case study was based on English and Romanian, where a system, originally developed for NER in English was adapted to Romanian.",
        "Their results suggest that such adaptation is easier than developing a named entity recognition system for Romanian from scratch.",
        "However, the authors also mention that not all phenomena in Romanian have been taken into account which resulted in low recall."

        "Ukrainian belongs to the languages where the named entities are usually capitalized, which makes their detection relatively easy.",
        "In this paper we focus on using minimal information about the language in combination with the patterns learnt from the Web data, features extracted from the corpus and Leven-shtein similarity measure.",
        "Our hypothesis behind all three components is the following.",
        "We expect orthographic features be useful for a named entity detection but not sufficient for its classification.",
        "Contextual information may already help but as we do not intend to use lemmas but words instead, it will likely not boost recall ofthe named entity recongnition.",
        "To be able to detect more named enities in the text, we propose to use patterns collected from the Web and Levenshtein similarity measure.",
        "Patterns from the Web should provide more contextual information than can be found in a corpus.",
        "In addition, a similarity measure gives us an opportunity to detect the named entities which have the same stem.",
        "The latter is especially useful when the same entity was mentioned in the training set as well as in the test data but its flections differ.",
        "The intention of our study is, therefore, to start with a standard set of features (contextual and orthographic) as used for the many languages in the past and to add some means which would account for the fact that Ukrainian is a highly-inflected language.",
        "First, we consider the features which can be easily extracted given the data, such as contextual and orthographic ones as described below in Table 1.",
        "For each word in a corpus its context (2 tokens to left and to the right) and its orthographic features are extracted.",
        "Orthographic features are binary features which, for instance, indicate whether a word is capitalized (1 or 0), etc.",
        "We have selected the following machine learning methods: k-nearest neighbor (knn) and voting and stacking as the ensemble methods which have been successfully applied to the named entity recognition task in the past.",
        "To overcome data sparseness and to increase recall, we make use of two techniques.",
        "First, we apply the patterns extracted from the Web.",
        "If we wish to collect patterns for a certain category C of the named entities (e.g.), we first collect all named entities that fall into it.",
        "Then, for each X e C, we use X as a query term for Google (for this purpose we used the Google API).",
        "The queries we constructed were mainly based on the locations, such as etc.",
        "For each of these words we created queries by declining them (as there are 7 cases in Ukrainian language which causes the high variability).",
        "Consequently, we get many snippets where X occurs.",
        "To extract patterns from snippets, we fix a context and use 2 words to the left and to the right of X as in the classification approach above.",
        "The patterns which only consist of a named entity, closed-class words (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, etc.)",
        "and punctuation are removed as such that do not provide enough evidence to classify an instance.",
        "Intuitively, if there are many patterns acquired from the large collection of data on the Web, they must be sufficient (in some sense even redundant) to recognize named entities in a text.",
        "For instance, such pattern as was located in X in English can correspond to three patterns in Ukrainian was located (fem., sing.)",
        "in X, was located (masc., sing.)",
        "in X, was located (neut., sing.)",
        "in X.",
        "Even though these patterns could be embraced in one, we are rather interested in collecting all possible patterns avoiding this way stemming and morphological analysis.",
        "As in Talukdar's approach (Talukdar et al., 2006), we expect patterns to provide high precision.",
        "We are, however, concerned about the size of Ukrainian Web which is much smaller than English part of the Web.",
        "As a consequence, it is not clear whether recall can be improved much by using the Web data.",
        "Yet another approach to address rich morphology of Ukrainian, is to carry out a matching of probable named entities in a test set against a list of named entities in a training set.",
        "It can be done by using string edit distances, such as Levenshtein.",
        "Levenshtein (or edit) distance of two strings, x and y is measured as the minimal number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into the other.",
        "Levenshtein distance has become popular in the natural language processing field and was used for the variety of tasks (e.g., semantic role labeling ).",
        "Definition 1 (Levenshtein distance) Given two sequences x = x\\x2 ... xn and y = y\\y2 ... ym of a length n and m respectively, Levenshtein distance is defined as follows",

        "Let A be a candidate named entity and L a list of all named entities found in the training set.",
        "By computing the Levenshtein distance between A and each element from L, the nearest neighbor to A will be a NE with the lowest Levenshtein score.",
        "It might, however, happen that there are no named entities in a training set that correspond to the candidate in a test set.",
        "Consider, for instance the Levenshtein distance of two words (George) and (besides) which is equal to 2.",
        "Even though the distance is low, we do not wish to classify as a named entity whose type is PERSON because it is simply a preposition.",
        "The problem we described can be solved in several ways.",
        "On the one hand, it is possible to use a list of stop words with most frequent prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns listed.",
        "On the other hand, we can also set a threshold for the Levenshtein distance.",
        "In the experiments we present below, we avoid setting threshold by using a simple heuristics.",
        "We align the first letters of A with its nearest neighbor.",
