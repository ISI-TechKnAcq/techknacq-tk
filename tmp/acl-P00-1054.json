        "Many machine translation systems have been developed and commercialized.",
        "When these systems are faced with unknown domains, however, their performance degrades.",
        "Although there are several reasons behind this poor performance, in this paper, we concentrate on one of the major problems, i.e., building a bilingual dictionary for transfer.",
        "A bilingual dictionary consists of rules that map a part of the representation of a source sentence to a target representation by taking grammatical differences (such as the word order between the source and target languages) into consideration.",
        "These rules usually use case-frames as their base and accompany syntactic and/or semantic constraints on mapping from a source word to a target word.",
        "For many machine translation systems, experienced experts on individual systems compile the bilingual dictionary, because this is a complicated and difficult task.",
        "In other words, this task is knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive, and therefore, time-consuming.",
        "Typically, the developer of a machine translation system has to spend several years building a general-purpose bilingual dictionary.",
        "Unfortunately, such a general-purpose dictionary is not almighty, in that (1) when faced with a new domain, unknown source words may emerge and/or some domain-specific usages of known words may appear and (2) the accuracy of the target word selection may be insufficient due to the handling of many target words simultaneously.",
        "Recently, to overcome these bottlenecks in knowledge building and/or tuning, the automation of lexicography has been studied by many researchers: (1) approaches using a decision tree: the ID3 learning algorithm is applied to obtain transfer rules from case-frame representations of simple sentences with a thesaurus for generalization (Akiba et.",
        "al., 1996 and Tanaka, 1995); (2) approaches using structural matching: to obtain transfer rules, several search methods have been proposed for maximal structural matching between trees obtained by parsing bilingual sentences (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Meyers et.",
        "al., 1998; and Kaji et.",
        "al.,1992)."

        "By measuring the similarity between (1) an unknown sentence that includes the concerned source word and (2) known sentences that include the concerned source word, we can select the target word which is included in the most similar sentence.",

        "We assume that selecting a cluster is equal to selecting the target word.",
        "If we can merge such equivalent translation variations of target words into clusters, we can improve the accuracy of lexical transfer for two reasons: (1) doing so makes the mark larger by neglecting accidental differences among target words; (2) doing so collects scattered pieces of evidence and strengthens the effect.",
