        "The goal of thematic segmentation is to identify boundaries of topically coherent segments in text documents.",
        "Giving a rigorous definition of the notion of topic is difficult, but the task of discourse/dialogue segmentation into thematic episodes is usually described by invoking an “intuitive notion of topic” (Brown and Yule, 1998).",
        "Thematic segmentation also relates to several notions such as speaker’s intention, topic flow and cohesion.",
        "Since it is elusive what mental representations humans use in order to distinguish a coherent text, different surface markers (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Passonneau and Litman, 1997) and external knowledge sources (Kozima and Fu-rugori, 1994) have been exploited for the purpose of automatic thematic segmentation.",
        "Halliday and Hasan (1976) claim that the text meaning is realised through certain language resources and they refer to these resources by the term of cohesion.",
        "The major classes of such text-forming resources identified in (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) are: substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, reiteration and collocation.",
        "In this paper, we examine one form of lexical cohesion, namely lexical reiteration.",
        "Following some of the most prominent discourse theories in literature (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Marcu, 2000), a hierarchical representation of the thematic episodes can be proposed.",
        "The basis for this is the idea that topics can be recursively divided into subtopics.",
        "Real texts exhibit a more intricate structure, including ‘semantic returns’ by which a topic is suspended at one point and resumed later in the discourse.",
        "However, we focus here on a reduced segmentation problem, which involves identifying non-overlapping and non-hierarchical segments at a coarse level of granularity.",
        "Thematic segmentation is a valuable initial tool in information retrieval and natural language processing.",
        "For instance, in information access systems, smaller and coherent passage retrieval is more convenient to the user than whole-document retrieval and thematic segmentation has been shown to improve the passage-retrieval performance (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993).",
        "In cases such as collections of transcripts there are no headers or paragraph markers.",
        "Therefore a clear separation of the text into thematic episodes can be used together with highlighted keywords as a kind of ‘quick read guide’ to help users to quickly navigate through and understand the text.",
        "Moreover automatic thematic segmentation has been shown to play an important role in automatic summarization (Mani, 2001), anaphora resolution and dis",
        "course/dialogue understanding.",
        "In this paper, we concern ourselves with the task of linear thematic segmentation and are interested in finding out whether different segmentation systems can perform well on artificial and real data sets without specific parameter tuning.",
        "In addition, we will refer to the implications of the choice of a particular error metric for evaluation results.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
