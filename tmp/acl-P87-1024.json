        "In this paper we describe a computational model of concept acquisition for natural language making use of positive-only data, modelled on a theory of lexical semantics.",
        "This theory, the Extended Aspect Calculus acts together with a markedness theory for thematic roles to constrain what a possible word type is, just as a grammar defines what a well-formed tree structure is in syntax.",
        "We argue that linguistic specific knowledge and learning principles are needed for concept acquisition from positive evidence alone\".",
        "Furthermore, this model posits a close interaction between the predicates of visual perception and the early semantic interpretation of thematic roles as used in linguistic expressions.",
        "In fact, we claim that these relations act as constraints to the development of predicate hierachies in language acquisition.",
        "Finally, we describe TULLY, an implementation of this model in ZETALISP and discuss its design in the context of machine learning research.",
        "There has been little work on the acquisition of thematic relation and case roles, due to the absence of any consensus on their formal properties.",
        "In this research we begin to address what a theory of thematic relations might look like, using learnability theory as a metric for evaluating the model.",
        "We claim that there is an important relationship between visual or imagistic perception and the development of thematic relations in linguistic usage for a child.",
        "This has been argued recently by Jackendoff (1983, 1985) and was an assumption in the pioneering work of Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976).",
        "Here we argue that the conceptual abstraction of thematic information does not develop arbitrarily but along a given, predictable path; namely, a developmental path that starts with tangible perceptual predicates (e.g. spatial, causative) to later form the more abstract mental and cognitive predicates.",
        "In this view thematic relations are actually sets of thematic properties, related by a partial ordering.",
        "This effectively establishes a markedness theory for thematic roles that a learning system must adhere to in the acquisition of lexical entries for a language.",
        "We will discuss two computational methods for concept development in natural language:",
        "(1) Feature Relaxation of particular features of the arguments to a verb.",
        "This is performed by a constraint propagation method.",
        "(2) Thematic Decoupling of semantically incorporated information from the verb.",
        "When these two learning techniques are combined with the model of lexical semantics adopted here, the stages of development for verb acquisition are similar to those acknowledged for child language acquisition."

        "Work in machine learning has shown the usefulness to an inductive concept-learning system of inducing \"bias\" in the learning process (cf. [Mitchell 1977, 1978], [Michalski 1983]).",
        "An even more promising development is the move to base the bias on domain-intensive models, as seen in [Mitchell et al.",
        "1985], [Utgoff 19851, and [Winston et al.",
        "1983].",
        "This is an important direction for those concerned with natural language acquisition, as it converges with a long-held belief of many psychologists and linguists that domain-specific information is necessary for learning (cf. [Slobin 1982], [Pinker 19841, [Bowerman 1974], [Chomsky 1980]).",
        "Indeed, Berwick (1984) moves in exactly this direction.",
        "Berwick describes a model for the acquisition of syntactic knowledge based on a restricted X-syntactic parser, a modification of the Marcus parser ((Marcus 1980]).",
        "The domain knowledge specified to the system in this case is a parametric parser and learning system that adapts to a particular linguistic environment, given only positive data.",
        "This is just the sort of biasing necessary to account for data on syntactic acquisition.",
        "One area of language acquisition that has not been sufficiently addressed within computational models is the acquisition of conceptual structure.",
        "For language acquisition, the problem can be stated as follows: How does the child identify a particular thematic role with a specific grammatical function in the sentence?",
        "This is the problem of mapping the semantic functions of a proposition into specified syntactic positions in a sentence.",
        "Pinker (1984) makes an interesting suggestion (due originally to D. Lebeaux) in answer to this question.",
        "He proposes that one of the strategies available to the language learner involves a sort of \"template matching\" of argument to syntactic position.",
        "There are canonical configurations that are the default mappings and non-canonical mappings for the exceptions.",
        "For example, the template consists of two rows, one of thematic roles, and the other of syntactic positions.",
        "A canonical mapping exists if no lines joining the two rows cross.",

        "(1) Mary hit Bill.",
        "(2) Bill was hit by Mary.",
        "With this principle we can represent the productivity of verb forms that are used but not heard by the child.",
        "We will adopt a modified version of the canonical mapping strategy for our system, and embed it within a theory of how perceptual primitives help derive linguistic concepts.",
        "As mentioned, one of the motivations for adopting the canonical mapping principle is the power it gives a learning system in the face of positive-only data.",
        "In terms of learnability theory, Berwick (1985) (following [Angluin 1978)) notes that to ensure successful acquisition of the language after a finite number of positive examples, something like the Subset Principle is necessary.",
        "We can compare this principle to a Version Space model of inductive learning( [Mitchell 1977, 1978]), with no negative instances.",
        "Generalization proceeds in a conservative fashion, taking only the narrowest concept that covers the data.",
        "How does this principle relate to lexical semantics and the way thematic relations are mapped to syntactic positions?",
        "We claim that the connection is very direct.",
        "Concept learning begins with spatial, temporal, and causal predicates being the most salient.",
        "This follows from our supposition that these are innate structures, or are learned very early.",
        "Following Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976), [Miller 1985], and most psychologists, we assume the prelinguistic child is already able to discern spatial orientations, causation, and temporal dependencies.",

        "In this paper we have outlined a theory of acquisition for the semantic roles associated, with verbs.",
        "Specifically, we argue that perceptual predicates form the foundation for later conceptual development in language, and propose a specific algorithm for learning employing a theory of markedness for thematic types and the two strategies of thematic decoupling and constraint relaxation and propagation.",
        "The approach sketched above will doubtless need revision and refinement on particular points, but is claimed to offer a new perspective which can contribute to the solution of some long-standing puzzles in acquisition."
