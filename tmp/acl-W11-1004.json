        "With the rapid development of large-scale parallel corpus, research on data-driven SMT has made good progress to the real world applications.",
        "Currently, for a typical automatic translation task, the SMT system searches and exactly matches the input sentences with the phrases or rules in the models.",
        "Obviously, if the following two conditions could be satisfied, namely:",
        "• the words in the parallel corpus are highly aligned so that the phrase alignment can be performed well;",
        "• the coverage of the input sentence by the parallel corpus is high;",
        "then the \"exact phrase match\" translation method could bring a good translation.",
        "However, for some language pairs, it is not easy to obtain a huge amount of parallel data, so it is not that easy to satisfy these two conditions.",
        "To alleviate this problem, paraphrase-enriched SMT systems have been proposed to show the effectiveness of incorporating paraphrase information.",
        "In terms of the position at which paraphrases are incorporated in the MT-pipeline, previous work can be organized into three different categories:",

        "Another directly related work is to use word lattices to deal with multi-source translation (Schroeder et al., 2009), in which paraphrases are actually generated from the alignments of difference source sentences.",
        "Comparing these three methods, the word-lattice-based method has the least overheads because:",
        "• The translation model augmentation method has to rerun the whole MT pipeline once the inputs are changed, while the word-lattice-based method only need to transform the new input sentences into word lattices.",
        "• The training corpus augmentation method requires corpus-scale expansion, which drastically increases the computational complexity on large corpora, while the word-lattice-based method only deals with the development set and test set.",
        "observed that the word-lattice-based method performed better than the translation model augmentation method on different scales and two different language pairs in several translation tasks.",
        "Thus they concluded that the word-lattice-based method is preferable for this task.",
        "However, there are still some drawbacks for the word-lattice-based method:",
        "• In the lattice construction processing, duplicated paths are created and fed into SMT decoders.",
        "This decreases the paraphrase capacity in the word lattices.",
        "Note that we use the phrase \"paraphrase capacity\" to represent the amount of paraphrases that are actually built into the word lattices.",
        "As presented in (Du et al., 2010), only a limited number of paraphrases are allowed to be used while others are pruned during the construction process, so duplicate paths actually decrease the number of paraphrases that contribute to the translation quality.",
        "• The lattice decoding in SMT decoder have a very high computational complexity which",
        "makes the system less feasible in real time application.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we use confusion networks (CNs) instead of word lattices to carry paraphrase information in the inputs for SMT decoders.",
        "CNs are constructed from the aforementioned word lattices, while duplicate paths are merged to increase paraphrase capacity (e.g. by admitting more non-duplicate paraphrases without increasing the input size).",
        "Furthermore, much less computational complexity is required to perform CN decoding instead of lattice decoding in the SMT decoder.",
        "We carried out experiments on small-, medium-and large-scale English-Chinese translation tasks to compare against a baseline PBSMT system, the translation model augmentation of (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) method and the word-lattice-based method of (Du et al., 2010) to show the effectiveness of our novel approach.",
        "The motivation of this work is to use CN as the compromise between speed and quality, which comes from previous studies in speech recognition and speech translation: in (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2005), word lattices are transformed into CNs to obtain compact representations of multiple aligned ASR hypotheses in speech understanding; in (Bertoldi et al., 2008), CNs are also adopted instead of word lattices as the source-side inputs for speech translation systems.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to show that this compromise also works for SMT systems incorporating source-language paraphrases in the inputs.",

        "• Using paraphrases to improve system optimization (Madnani et al., 2007).",
        "With an English-English MT system, this work utilises paraphrases to reduce the number of manually translated references that are needed in the parameter tuning process of SMT, while preserved a similar translation quality.",

        "Compared with translation model augmentation with paraphrases (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), word-lattice-based paraphrasing for PBSMT is introduced in (Du et al., 2010).",
        "A brief overview of this method is given in this section.",
        "The first step of the word-lattice-based method is to generate paraphrases from parallel corpus.",
        "The algorithm in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) is used for this purpose by pivoting through phrases in the source-and the target languages: for each source phrase, all occurrences of its target phrases are found, and all the corresponding source phrases of these target phrases are considered as the potential paraphrases of the original source phrase (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "A paraphrase probability p(e2|e^ is defined to reflect the similarities between two phrases, as in (1):",
        "where the probability p(f \\e-]) is the probability that the original source phrase e1 translates as a particular phrase f on the target side, and p(e2|f ) is the probability that the candidate paraphrase e2 translates as the source phrase.",
        "Herep(e2|f ) andp(f \\e-]) are defined as the translation probabilities estimated using maximum likelihood by counting the observations of alignments between phrases e and f in the",
        "The second step is to transform input sentences in the development and test sets into word lattices with paraphrases extracted in the first step.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, given a sequence of words {w1,... ,wN} as the input, for each of the paraphrase pairs found in the source sentence (e.g. pi = {q1,..., qm} for {wx,..., wy}), add in extra nodes and edges to make sure those phrases coming from paraphrases share the same start nodes and end nodes with that of the original ones.",
        "Subsequently the following empirical methods are used to assign weights on paraphrases edges:",
        "• Edges originating from the input sentences are assigned weight 1.",
        "• The first edges for each of the paraphrases are calculated as in (4):",
        "where 1 stands for the first edge of paraphrase pi, and i is the probability rank of pi among those paraphrases sharing with a same start node, while k is a predefined constant as a trade-off parameter for efficiency and performance, which is related to the paraphrase capacity.",
        "• The rest of the edges corresponding to the paraphrases are assigned weight 1.",
        "The last step is to modify the MT pipeline to tune and evaluate the SMT system with word lattice inputs, as is described in (Du et al., 2010; Onishi et al., 2010).",
        "For further discussion, a real example of the generated word lattice is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In the word lattice, double-line circled nodes and solid lined edges come from originated from the original sentence, while others are generated from paraphrases.",
        "Word, weight and ranking of each edge are displayed in the figure.",
        "By adopting such an input structure, the diversity of the input sentences is increased to provide more flexible translation options during the decoding process, which has been shown to improve translation performance (Du et al., 2010).",
        "As can be seen in Figure 2, the construction process in the previous steps tends to generate duplicate paths in the word lattices.",
        "For example, there are two paths from node 6 to node 11 with the same words \"secretary of state\" but different edge probabilities (the path via node 27 and 28 has the probability 1/12, while the path via node 26 and 9 has the probability 1/99).",
        "This is because the aforementioned straightforward construction process does not track path duplications from different spans on the source side.",
        "Since the number of admitted paraphrases is restricted by parameter k in formula (4), the path duplication will decrease the paraphrase capacity to a certain extend.",
        "Moreover, state of the art PBSMT decoders (e.g. Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)) have a much higher computational complexity for lattice structures than for sentences.",
        "Thus even though only the test sentences need to be transformed into word lattices, decoding time is still too slow for real-time applications.",
        "Motivated by transforming ASR word-graphs into trade-off between efficiency and quality.",
        "We aim to merge duplicate paths in the word lattices to increase paraphrase capacity, and to speed up the decoding process via CN decoding.",

        "1. the ability to represent the original word lattice with a highly compact structure;",
        "2. all hypotheses in the word lattice are totally ordered, so that the decoding algorithm is mostly retained except for the collection of translation options and the handeling of e edges (Bertoldi et al., 2008), which requires much less computational resources than the lattice decoding.",

        "Previous studies provide several methods to do this.",

        "• Assign edge weights by the ranking of paraphrase probabilities, rather than by posterior probabilities from the modified method of (Mangu et al., 2000).",
        "This is similar to that given in formula (4).",
        "The reason for this is to reduce the impact of path duplications on the calculation of weights.",
        "Thus, we modified the construction process as follows:",
        "1.",
        "For each of the input word lattices, replace word texts with unique identifiers (to make the lattice alignment uncorrelated to the word similarity, since in this case, all words in the lattice are different from each other).",

        "Evenly distribute edge weights for each of the lattices by modifying formula (4) as in (5):",
        "where 1 <= j <= Mi, given ePi is the j edge of paraphrase pi, and Mi is the number of words in pi.",
        "This is to avoid large weights on the paraphrase edges for lattice alignments.",
        "3.",
        "Transform the weighted word lattices into CNs with the SRILM toolkit, and the paraphrase ranking information is carried on the edges.",
        "4.",
        "Replace the word texts in step 1, and then for each column of the CN, merge edges with same words by keeping those with the highest ranking (a smaller number indicates a higher ranking, and edges from the original sentences will always have the highest ranking).",
        "Note that to assign ranking for each e edge which does not appear in the word lattice, we use the ranking of non-original edges (in the same column) which have the closest posterior probability to it.",
        "(Assign ranking 1 if failed to find a such edge).",
        "5.",
        "Reassign the edge weights: 1) edges from original sentences are assigned with weight 1; 2) edges from paraphrases are assigned with an empirical method as in (6):",
        "where epn are edges corresponding with paraphrase pi, and i is the probability rank of pi in formula (4), while k is also defined in formula (4).",
        "A real example of a constructed CN is depicted in Figure 3, which is correspondent with the word lattice in Figure 2.",
        "Unlike the word lattices, all the nodes in the CN are generated from the original sentence, while solid lined edges come from the original sentence, and dotted lined edges correspond to paraphrases.",
        "As in shown in the Figures, duplicate paths in the word lattices have been merged into CN edges by step 4.",
        "For example, the two occurrences of \"secretary of state\" in the word lattices (one path from node 6 to 11 via 27 and 28, and one path from node 6 to 11 via 26 and 9 in the word lattice) are merged to keep the highest-ranked path in the CN (note there is one e edge between node 9 and 10 to accomplish the merging operation).",
        "Furthermore, each edge in the CN is assigned a weight by formula (6).",
        "This weight assignment procedure penalizes paths from paraphrases according to the paraphrase probabilities, in a similar manner to the aforementioned word-lattice-based method.",
        "By transforming word lattices into CNs, duplicate paths are merged.",
        "Furthermore the new features on the edges are introduced by formula (6), which is then tuned on the development set using MERT (Och, 2003) in the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "Since the SMT decoders are able to perform CN decoding (Bertoldi et al., 2008) in an efficient multi-stack decoding way, decoding time is drastically reduced compared to lattice decoding.",
        "The training steps are then modified as follows: 1) Extract phrase table, reordering table, and build target-side language models from parallel and monolingual corpora respectively for the PBSMT model; 2) Transform source sentences in the development set into word lattices, and then transform them into CNs using the method proposed in Section 3.1; 3) Tune the PBSMT model on the CNs via the development set.",
