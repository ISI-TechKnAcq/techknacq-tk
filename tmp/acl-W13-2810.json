      "text": [
        "We introduce an unsupervised approach to inducing parsimonious, relatively clean phrasal inversion transduction grammars or ITGs (Wu, 1997) that employs a theoretically well-founded minimum description length (MDL) objective to explicitly drive two opposing, extreme ITGs towards one minimal ITG.",
        "This represents a new attack on the problem suffered by most current SMT approaches of learning phrase translations that require enormous amounts of runtime memory, contain a high degree of redundancy, and fails to provide an obvious basis for generalization to abstract translation schemas.",
        "In particular, phrasal SMT models such as Koehn et al. (2003) and Chiang (2005) often search for candidate translation segments and transduction rules by committing to a word alignment based on very different assumptions (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996), and heuristically derive lexical segment translations (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "In fact, it is possible to improve the performance by tossing away most of the learned segmental translations (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "In addition to preventing such wastefulness, our work aims to also provide an obvious basis for generalization to abstract translation schemas by driving the search for phrasal rules by simultaneously using two opposing types of ITG constraints that have both individually been empirically proven to match phrase reordering patterns across translations well.",
        "We adopt a more ?pure?",
        "methodology for evaluating transduction grammar induction than typical system building papers.",
        "Instead of embedding our learned ITG in the midst of many other heuristic components for the sake of a short term boost in BLEU, we focus on scientifically understanding the behavior of pure MDL-based search for phrasal translations, divorced from the effect of other variables, even though BLEU is naturally much lower this way.",
        "The common practice of plugging some aspect of a learned ITG into either (a) a long pipeline of training heuristics and/or (b) an existing decoder that has been patched up to compensate for earlier modeling mistakes, as we and others have done before?see for example Cherry and Lin (2007); Zhang et al. (2008); Blun-som et al. (2008, 2009); Haghighi et al. (2009); Saers and Wu (2009, 2011); Blunsom and Cohn (2010); Burkett et al. (2010); Riesa and Marcu (2010); Saers et al. (2010); Neubig et al. (2011, 2012)?obscures the specific traits of the induced grammar.",
        "Instead, we directly use our learned ITG in translation mode (any transduction grammar also represents a decoder when parsing with the input sentence as a hard constraint) which allows us to see exactly which aspects of correct translation the transduction rules have captured.",
        "When the structure of an ITG is induced without supervision, it has so far been assumed that smaller rules get clumped together into larger rules.",
        "This is a natural way to search, since maximum likelihood (ML) tends to improve with longer rules, which is typically balanced with Bayesian priors (Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "Bayesian priors are also used in Gibbs sampling (Blunsom et al., 2008, 2009; Blunsom and Cohn, 2010), as well as other non-parametric learning methods (Neubig et al., 2011, 2012).",
        "All of the above evaluate their models by feeding them into mismatched decoders, making it hard to evaluate how accurate the learned models themselves were.",
        "In this work we take a radically different approach, and start with the longest rules possible and attempt to segment them into shorter rules iteratively.",
        "This makes ML useless, since our initial model maximizes it.",
        "Instead, we balance the ML objective with a minimum description length (MDL) objective, which let us escape the initial ML optimum by rewarding model parsimony.",
        "Transduction grammars can also be induced with supervision from treebanks, which cuts down the search space by enforcing external constraints (Galley et al., 2006).",
        "This complicates the learning process by adding external constraints that are bound to match the translation model poorly.",
        "It does, however, constitute a way to borrow nonter-minal categories that help the translation model.",
        "MDL has been used before in monolingual grammar induction (Gr?nwald, 1996; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994), as well as to interpret visual scenes (Si et al., 2011).",
        "Our work is markedly different in that we (a) induce an ITG rather than a monolingual grammar, and (b) focus on learning the terminal segments rather than the nonterminal categories.",
        "Iterative segmentation has also been used before, but only to derive a word alignment as part of a larger pipeline (Vilar and Vidal, 2005).",
        "The paper is structured as follows: we start by describing theMDL principle (Section 2).",
        "We then describe the initial ITGs (Section 3), followed by the algorithm that induces an MDL-optimal ITG from them (Section 4).",
        "After that we describe the experiments (Section 5), and the results (Section 6).",
        "Finally, we offer some conclusions (Section 7)."
