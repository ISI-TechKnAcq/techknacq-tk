        "Incongruity and taboo meanings are typical ingredients of humor.",
        "When used in the proper context, the expression of contrasting or odd meanings can induce surprise, confusion or embarrassment and, thus, make people laugh.",
        "While methods from computational linguistics can be used to estimate the capability of words and phrases to induce incongruity or to evoke taboo meanings, computational generation of humorous texts has remained a great challenge.",
        "In this paper we propose a method for automated generation of adult humor by lexical replacement.",
        "We consider a setting where a short text is provided to the system, such as an instant message, and the task is to make the text funny by replacing one word in it.",
        "Our approach is based on careful introduction of incongruity and taboo words to induce humor.",
        "We propose three types of lexical constraints as building blocks of humorous word substitution.",
        "(1) The form constraints turn the text into a pun.",
        "The constraints thus concern the similarity of sounds or spellings of the original word and the substitute.",
        "(2) The taboo constraint requires the substitute to be a taboo word.",
        "This is a well-known feature in some jokes.",
        "We hypothesize that the effectiveness of humorous lexical replacement can be increased with the introduction of taboo constraints.",
        "(3) Finally, the context constraints concern the position and context of the replacement.",
        "Our assumption is that a suitably positioned substitution propagates the tabooness (defined here as the capability to evoke taboo meanings) to phrase level and amplifies the semantic contrast with the original text.",
        "Our second concrete hypothesis is that the context constraints further boost the funniness.",
        "We evaluated the above hypotheses empirically by generating 300 modified versions of SMS messages and having each of them evaluated by 90 subjects using a crowdsourcing platform.",
        "The results show a statistically highly significant increase of funniness and agreement with the use of the humorous lexical constraints.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we give a short overview of theoretical background and related work on humor generation.",
        "In Section 3, we present the three types of constraints for lexical replacement to induce humor.",
        "The empirical evaluation is presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 contains concluding remarks."

        "Humor, Incongruity and Tabooness A set of theories known as incongruity theory is probably the most influential approach to the study of humor and laughter.",
        "The concept of incongruity, first described by Beattie (1971), is related to the perception of incoherence, semantic contrast, or inappropriateness, even though there is no precise and agreed definition.",
        "Raskin (1985) formulated the incongruity concept in terms of script opposition.",
        "This has been developed further, into the General Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo and Raskin, 1991).",
        "A cognitive treatment of incongruity in humor is described by Summerfelt et al. (2010).",
        "One specific form of jokes frequently discussed in the literature consists of the so called forced reinterpretation jokes.",
        "E.g.: Alcohol isn't a problem, it's a solution... Just ask any chemist.",
        "In his analysis of forced reinterpretation jokes, Ritchie (2002) emphasises the distinction between three different elements of the joke processing: CONFLICT is the initial perception of incompatibility between punchline and setup according to the initial obvious interpretation; CONTRAST denotes the perception of the contrastive connection between the two interpretations; while INAPPROPRIATENESS refers to the intrinsic oddness or tabooness characterising the funny interpretation.",
        "All three concepts are often connected to the notion of incongruity.",
        "In his integrative approach to humor theories, Martin (2007) discusses the connection between tabooness and incongruity resolution.",
        "In particular, he discusses the salience hypothesis (Goldstein et al., 1972; Attardo and Raskin, 1991), according to which ?the purpose of aggressive and sexual elements in jokes is to make salient the information needed to resolve the incongruity?.",
        "Humor Generation In previous research on computational humor generation, puns are often used as the core of more complex humorous texts, for example as punchlines of simple jokes (Raskin and Attardo, 1994; Levison and Lessard, 1992; Venour, 1999; McKay, 2002).",
        "This differs from our setting, where we transform an existing short text into a punning statement.",
        "Only few humor generation systems have been empirically evaluated.",
        "The JAPE program (Bin-sted et al., 1997) produces specific types of punning riddles.",
        "HAHAcronym (Stock and Strap-parava, 2002) automatically generates humorous versions of existing acronyms, or produces a new funny acronym, starting with concepts provided by the user.",
        "The evaluations indicate statistical significance, but the test settings are relatively specific.",
        "Below, we will present an approach to evaluation that allows comparison of different systems in the same generation task."

        "), and returns the resulting text.",

        "Using a phonetically similar word as a replacement, however, makes the statement pseudo-ambiguous, since the original intended meaning can also be recovered.",

        "interpretations ?",
        "the literal one and the original one ?",
        "increasing the likelihood of humorous incongruity.",
        "Requiring the substitute to share part-of-speech with the original word works in this direction too, and additionally increases the likelihood that the resulting text is a valid English statement.",
        "Implementation We adopt an extended definition of punning and also consider orthographically similar or rhyming words as possible substitutes.",
        "Two words are considered orthographically similar if one word is obtained with a single character deletion, addition, or replacement from the other one.",
        "We call two words phonetically similar if their phonetic transcription is orthographically similar according to the above definition.",
        "Two words rhyme if they have same positions of tonic accent, and if they are phonetically identical from the most stressed syllable to the end of the word.",
        "Our implementation of these constraints uses the WordNet lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998) and CMU pronunciation dictionary1.",
        "The latter also provides a collection of words not normally contained in standard English dictionaries, but commonly used in informal language.",
        "This increases the space of potential replacements.",

        "A subsequent Student t-test allows to assign a measure of cohesion to each n-gram (Doucet and Ahonen-Myka, 2006).",

        "One of the reasons for the choice of taboo words as lexical constraint is that they allows the system to generate humorous text potentially appreciated by young adults, which are the majority of crowdsourcing users (Ross et al., 2010).",
        "We applied the humor generation method on the first 5000 messages of NUS SMS Corpus6, a corpus of real SMS messages (Chen and Kan, 2012).",
        "We carried out every possible lexical replacement under each of the three conditions mentioned above, one at a time, so that the resulting messages have exactly one word substituted.",

        "Table 1 shows two example outputs of the humor generator under each of the three experimental conditions.",

To rank the generated messages, we take the product of Collective Funniness and Upper Agreement UA(3) and call it the overall Humor Effectiveness (HE).",

        "This is likely because of the form of surprise they induce.",

        "Furthermore, the possible presence of crowd-working scammers (only partially filtered by the gold standard questions) could have reduced the statistical power of our analysis.",
        "Finally, the adopted humor generation task (based on a single word substitution) is extremely simple and the constraints might have not been sufficiently capable to produce a detectable increase of humor appreciation.",
        "The statistically strong results that we obtained can make this evaluation approach attractive for related tasks.",
        "In our methodology, we focused attention to the correlation between the parameters of the system (in our case, the constraints used in lexical selection) and the performance of humor generation.",
        "We used a multidimensional measure of humorous effect (in terms of funniness and agreement) to measure subtly different aspects of the humorous response.",
        "We then adopted a comparative setting, where we can measure improvements in the performance across different systems or variants.",
        "In the future, it would be interesting to use a similar setting to empirically investigate more subtle ways to generate humor, potentially with weaker effects but still recognizable in this setting.",
        "For instance, we would like to investigate the use of other word lists besides taboo domains and the extent to which the semantic relatedness itself could contribute to the humorous effect.",
        "The current techniques can be improved, too, in various ways.",
        "In particular, we plan to extend the use of n-grams to larger contexts and consider more fine-grained tuning of other constraints, too.",
        "One goal is to apply the proposed methodology to isolate, on one hand, parameters for inducing incongruity and, on the other hand, parameters for making the incongruity funny.",
        "Finally, we are interested in estimating the probability to induce a humor response by using different constraints.",
        "This would offer a novel way to intentionally control the humorous effect."
