        "Question answering has drawn significant attention from the last decade (Prager, 2006).",
        "It attempts to answer the question posed in natural language by providing the answer phrase rather than the whole documents.",
        "An important step in question answering (QA) is to classify the question to the anticipated type of the answer.",
        "For example, the question of Who discovered x-rays should be classified into the type of human (individual).",
        "This information would narrow down the search space to identify the correct answer string.",
        "In addition, this information can suggest different strategies to search and verify a candidate answer.",
        "In fact, the combination of question classification and the named entity recognition is a key approach in modern question answering systems (Voorhees and Dang, 2005).",
        "The question classification is by no means trivial: Simply using question wh-words can not achieve satisfactory results.",
        "The difficulty lies in classifying the what and which type questions.",
        "Considering the example What is the capital of Yugoslavia, it is of location (city) type, while What is the pH scale is of definition type.",
        "As with the previous work of (Li and Roth, 2002; Li and Roth, 2006; Krishnan et al., 2005; Moschitti et al., 2007), we propose a feature driven statistical question classifier (Huang et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, we propose head word feature and augment semantic features of such head words using Word-Net.",
        "In addition, Lesk's word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm is adapted and the depth of hypernym feature is optimized.",
        "With further augment of other standard features such as unigrams, we can obtain accuracy of 89.0% using ME model for 50 fine classes over UIUC dataset.",
        "In addition to building an accurate question classifier, we investigate the contribution of this question classifier to a feature driven question answering rank model.",
        "It is worth noting that, most of the features we used in question answering rank model, depend on the question type information.",
        "For instance, if a question is classified as a type of sport, we then only care about whether there are sport entities existing in the candidate sentences.",
        "It is expected that a fine grained named entity recognizer (NER) should make good use of the accurate question type information.",
        "However, due to the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we employ the Stanford NER package (Finkel et al., 2005) which identifies only four types of named entities.",
        "Even with such a coarse named entity recognizer, the experiments show that the question classifier plays an important role in determining the performance of a question answering system.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as following.",
        "Section 2 reviews the maximum entropy model which are used in both question classification and question answering ranking.",
        "Section 3 presents the features used in question classification.",
        "Section 4 presents the question classification accuracy over UIUC question dataset.",
        "Section 5 presents the question answer features.",

        "We use the training data to train a maximum entropy model and use such model to rank test data set.",
        "Compared with a classification task (such as the question classifier), the ranking process requires one extra step: For data points which share the same question, the probabilities of being predicted as true label are used to rank the data points.",
        "In align with the previous work, performance is evaluated using mean reciprocal rank (MRR), top 1 prediction accuracy (topi) and top 5 prediction accuracy (top5).",
        "For the test data set, 157 among the 202 questions have correct answers found in retrieved sentences.",
        "This leads to the upper bound of MRR score being 77.8%.",
        "To evaluate how the quality of question classifiers affects the question answering, we have created three question classifiers: QC1, QC2 and QC3.",
        "The features which are used to train these question classifiers and their performance are shown in Table 5.",
        "Note that QC3 is the best question classifier we obtained in Section 4.",
        "The first experiment is to evaluate the individual contribution of various features derived using three question classifiers.",
        "Table 6 shows the baseline result and results using DIC, NE, NE-4, REG, SPE, and DEP features.",
        "The baseline is the key word search without the use of maximum entropy model.",
        "As can be seen, the question classifiers do not affect the DIC feature at all, as DIC feature does not depend on question classifiers.",
        "Better question classifier boosts considerable gain for NE, NE-4 and REG in their contribution to question answering.",
        "For example, the best question classifier QC3 outperforms the worst one (QC1) by 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.0% MRR scores for NE, NE-4 and REG respectively.",
        "However, it is surprising that the MRR and top5 contribution of NE and NE-4 decreases if QC1 is replaced by QC2, although the topi score results in performance gain slightly.",
        "This unexpected results can be partially explained as follows.",
        "For some questions, even QC2 produces correct predictions, the errors of NE and NE-4 features may cause overconfident scores for certain candidate sentences.",
        "As SPE and DEP are not directly dependent on question classifier, their individual contribution only changes slightly or remains the same for different question classifiers.",
        "If the best question classifier is used, the most important features are SPE and REG, which can individually boost the MRR score over 54%, while the others result in less significant gains.",
        "We now incrementally use various features and the results are show in Table 6 as well.",
        "As can be seen, the more features and the better question classifier are used, the higher performance the ME model has.",
        "The inclusion of REG and SPE results in significant boost for the performance.",
        "For example, if the best question classifier QC3 is used, the REG results in 6.9% and 8% gain for MRR and topi scores respectively.",
        "This is due to a large portion of NUM type questions in test dataset.",
        "The SPE feature contributes significantly to the performance due to its high precision in answering birth/death time/location questions.",
        "NE and NE-4 result in reasonable gains while DEP feature contributes little.",
        "However, this does not mean that DEP is not important, as once the model reaches a high MRR score, it becomes hard to improve.",
