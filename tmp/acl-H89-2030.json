        "This paper discusses the extension of ViewGen, a program for belief ascription, to the area of intensional object identification with applications to battle environments, and its combination in a overall system with MGR, a Model-Generative Reasoning system, and PREMO a semantics-based parser for robust parsing of noisy message data.",
        "ViewGen represents the beliefs of agents as explicit, partitioned proposition-sets known as environments.",
        "Environments are convenient, even essential, for addressing important pragmatic issues of reasoning.",
        "The paper concentrates on showing that the transfer of information in intensional object identification and belief ascription itself can both be seen as different manifestations of a single environment-amalgamation process.",
        "The entities we shall be concerned with will be ones, for example, the system itself believes to be separate entities while it is computing the beliefs and reasoning of a hostile agent that believes them to be the same entity (e.g. we believe enemy radar shows two of our ships to be the same ship, or vice-versa.",
        "The KAL disaster should bring the right kind of scenario to mind).",
        "The representational issue we address is how to represent that fictional single entity in the belief space of the other agent, and what content it should have given that it is an amalgamation of two real entities.",
        "A major feature of the paper is our work on embedding within the ViewGen belief-and-point-of-view system the knowledge representation system of our MGR reasoner, and then bringing together the multiple viewpoints offered by ViewGen with the multiple representations of MGR.",

        "The purpose of this paper is to bring together the reasoning techniques used in the MGR and ViewGen systems and combine those with the PREMO robust parsing system (see references in separate sections below) to yield a combined approach to understanding text, particularly the interpretation or gist-ing of text which may be ill-formed, fragmented, stylized or even self-contradictory (when produced under stressful conditions, but evaluable against an appropriate knowledge base nonetheless).",
        "We also aim to build in pointers to the evaluation of the system as we go.",
        "Another guiding principle is to combine if possible, the benefits of being knowledge and situation based, when needed for interpretation, with the benefits that come from large scale automated analysis techniques drawn from the use of machine readable dictionaries and large text samples.",
        "We shall direct our examples where possible to realistic military scenarios drawn from other Army-sponsored work at CRL and construct scenarios based on ship or troop unit sightings and casualty reports.",
        "However, our techniques are better, we hope, than the individual scenarios we can construct.",
        "In other cases we shall use the standard cases with which the systems have been developed.",
        "The overall aim is to produce a system that takes in noisy messages and data, has access to both Blue databases and military doctrine (in terms of beliefs and goals) and, in certain circumstances, access also to Red Army beliefs and goals.",
        "A number of possible scenarios are tentatively put forward at the end of the paper, in which the combination of the techniques discussed here could provide advice to, and a check upon the decisons of, the G2 officer in a Blue Army Corps, particularly in terms of the consistency of the advice offered the commander and consilience of the belief and data structures maintained at other lower levels of the system (e.g.",
        "Divisions).",
        "In the first three sections of the paper we summarize the PREMO, MGR and ViewGen techniques and then proceed to a discussion of how to link them: in general we envisage an overall system in which information moves (outward in the diagram below) from the robust parser PREMO, to the MGR, the generator of alternative scenarios/models, to ViewGen the point-of-view shell that considers the possible points of view in terms of the environments of other agents (e.g. Blue Generals view of Red General's view of a particular tank division).",
        "Both MGR and ViewGen also act as filters of possible but inapplicable models of the situation."

        "PREMO: the PREference Machine Organization is a knowledge-based Preference Semantics parser (Wilks 1972, 1975, 1978; Boguraev 1979; Carter 1984, 1987; Fass 1986, 1987, 1988; Huang 1984, 1988; Slator 1988a, 1988c) due to Brian Slator, with access to the large, text-specific, lexical semantic knowledge base created by the lexicon-provider of the CRL project on large scale lexical extraction from machine readable dictionaries (Wilks et al.",
        "in press).",
        "A fuller description of the relationship of PREMO to that project appears in (Slator & Wilks 1989).",
        "PREMO is the parser we intend to use initially for initial processing of military reports (sightings, casualties etc.)",
        "that have been generated rapidly under adverse",
        "conditions.",
        "Preference Semantics is a theory of language in which the meaning for a text is represented by a complex semantic structure that is built up out of smaller semantic components; this compositionality is a fairly typical feature of semantic theories.",
        "The principal difference between Preference Semantics and other semantic theories is in the explicit and computational accounting of ambiguous, metaphorical, and linguistically non-standard language use; which is to say, it is intended to deal with the actual world of English texts outside linguistic studies, ranging from newspaper texts (well-formed but full of the non-standard phenomena just listed) to rapidly written diagostic reports, like machine-repair, or reports of sightings, which have all those features and are grammatically ill-formed in addition..",
        "The links between the components of the semantic structures are created on the basis of semantic preference and coherence.",
        "In text and discourse theory, coherence is generally taken to refer to the meaningfulness of text.",
        "Fass (1987) suggests that in NLP work such as Preference Semantics the notions of \"satisfaction\" and \"violation\" (of selection restrictions or preferences) and the notion of \"semantic dis-tance\" (across structured type hierarchies) are different ways of characterising the meaningfulness of text; they capture different coherence relations.",
        "The original systems of Preference Semantics (Wilks 1972, 1975, 1978), were principally based on the coherence relation of \"inclusion\" (semantic preferences and selection restrictions); the emphasis in PREMO is more on the coherence relation based on semantic distance, although the original notions of coherence also survive.",
        "In Preference Semantics the semantic representation computed for a text is the one having the most semantically dense structure among the competing \"readings.\"",
        "Semantic density is a property of structures that have preferences regarding their own constituents, and satisfied preferences create density.",
        "Density is compared in terms of the existence of preference-matching features, the lack of preference-breaking features, and the length of the inference chains needed to justify each sense selection and constituent attachment decision.",
        "The job of a Preference Semantics parser, then, is to consider the various competing interpretations, of which there may be many, and to choose among them by finding the one that is the most semantically dense, and hence preferred.",
        "PREMO is a robust system for parsing natural language organized along the lines of an operating system.",
        "The state of every partial parse is captured in a \"process control block\" structure called a language object, and the control structure of the preference machine is a priority queue of these language objects.",
        "The language object at the front of the queue has the highest score as computed by a preference metric that weighs grammatical predictions, semantic type matching, and pragmatic coherence.",
        "The highest priority language object is the intermediate reading that is currently most preferred (the others are still \"alive,\" but not actively pursued); in this way the preference machine avoids combinatorial explosion by following a \"best-first\" strategy for parsing.",
        "Each \"ready\" process in the system captures the state of a partial parse with priority given to each parse \"process\" on the basis of a preference semantics evaluation.",
        "The \"time-slice\" for each process is whatever is needed to move forward one word in a local process sentence buffer (where each process operates on a private copy of the current sentence).",
        "After every time slice, the preference/priority for the currently \"running\" parse is recomputed and the language object for that process is returned to the priority queue.",
        "The first process to emerge from the queue with its sentence buffer empty is declared the winner and saved.",
        "This strategy is both a runtime optimization and an application of the \"Least Effort Principle\" of intuitively plausible language processing.",
        "The parsing is robust in that some structure is returned for every input, no matter how ill-formed or \"garden-pathological\" it is.",
        "A principal advance in PREMO over earlier Preference Semantics work is that it overcomes the semantic localism of that work that allowed peculiar but telling counterexamples to be created.",
        "A better-known one is due to Phil Hayes (quoted in Boden 1977): \"He licked the gun all over and the stock tasted good\".",
        "A Preference Semantics system might well get \"stock\" resolved to \"soup\" rather than \"gun stock\" based on the local preferences of the last clause, because it had no overall GUN context, or indeed any way of expressing that.",
        "The frame movement of the Seventies was intended to provide such contextual theories (e.g. Minsky 1975) but it has not been generally accepted that it did so.",
        "The script-based parsers from Yale (e.g. Gershman, 1977) were created in the same topic-based spirit tended to fall into the opposite fault: of not understanding what was said unless it did wholly conform to expectations.",
        "PREMO is intendeed to, and does, meet both requirements: the bottom-up coherence of preference combined by weightings with the topic-subject codes provided for LDOCE (Longmans Dictionary of Contemporary English, Procter et a1.1978) within the lexical acquisition project at CRL mentioned earlier."

        "Here our purpose is simply to review the basic ascription mechanism and then show its extension to the phenomena such as the identification of intensional objects.",
        "In interpreting an utterance by an agent, the system must ascribe a speech act to that agent; and doing that is a matter of ascribing specific intentions, beliefs, desires, expectations and so on to the agent.",
        "Thus, speech act ascription is an important special case of ascriptional reasoning.",
        "That speech-act considerations make reasoning about propositional attitudes essential for the computational modelling of discourse has been established at least since the work of Perrault and his colleagues (e.g. Perrault & Allen, 1980).",

        "No finite set of dialogue observations ever could establish conclusively that another believer was using modus ponens.",

        "Topic boxes are motivated by concerns of limited reasoning (see Section 5.1 on relevance, and also Wilks & Bien, 1983).",
        "In short, it is envisaged that reasoning takes place \"within\" a topic environment, as if it were the environment of a procedure in a programming language.",
        "Within ViewGen, environments are dynamically created and altered.",
        "ViewGen's \"knowledge-base\" can be seen as one large viewpoint containing a large number of topic environments, with each topic environment containing a group of \"beliefs\" that the system holds about the topic.",
        "The reader should note that each proposition in a topic environment has at least one symbol identical to the name of the topic.",
        "Each such proposition is therefore explicitly about the topic.",
        "There are, however, implicit ways in which a proposition can be \"about\" (or \"relevant to\") a topic.",
        "The simplest cases are generated by inheritance in the usual way: for example, if John is a man, then any proposition in a \"man\" topic environment is implicitly or indirectly about John.",
        "However, we choose not to put such a proposition in the John topic box, and will justify that decision in the later section on relevance (5.1 below).",
        "Again, the same proposition can occur in more than one box, as would the expression asserting that an elephant was larger than an atom, for it is about both atoms and elephants, and should appear under both topics..",
        "If the \"topic\" of a topic environment is a person (someone capable of having beliefs themselves), then the topic environment may contain, in addition to the beliefs about the person, a viewpoint environment containing particular beliefs held by that person about various topics.",
        "Normally and for obvious reasons of efficiency, this is only done for those beliefs of a given person that are, as some would put it, reportable, where that will often mean beliefs that conflict with those of the system itself.",
        "For example, suppose the system had beliefs about a person called John who believes that the Earth is flat.",
        "This would be pictorially represented as follows: The John viewpoint, shown as the box with \"John\" on the lower edge, is a nested viewpoint, as it is enclosed within the system viewpoint shown (through an intervening topic environment about John, shown as the box with \"John\" on its upper edge).",
        "For simplicity, in the diagram of a nested viewpoint we often leave out propositions that are not in the innermost topic box: in the above example we would leave out the beliefs that John is a man, and that he is six feet tall.",
        "Further simplifying this, we often leave out all but the innermost topic box, leaving only it and the viewpoint boxes.",
        "The system stores its own beliefs, and the beliefs of other agents that differ from the system's own beliefs.",
        "Others' viewpoints are generated on demand, a position we find both computationally and psychologically more plausible than the \"prestored nesting\" view mentioned above (Section 1).",
        "The process of generating a viewpoint can be regarded as an amalgamation mechanism that ascribes beliefs from one viewpoint to another (or, \"pushing one environment down into another\"); ascribing certain beliefs, transforming some, and blocking the ascription of others.",
        "The simplest form of this algorithm, described in Wilks & Bien (1979, 1983), is that a viewpoint should be generated using a default rule for ascription of beliefs.",
        "The default ascriptional rule is to assume that another person's view is the same as one's own except where there is explicit evidence to the contrary.",
        "An important special case of such examples is when the topic is the same as the agent, and we can illustrate with that.",
        "Suppose that at a certain stage in dialogue the system, acting as a medical diagnostician, has the view of John that he is not healthy, and is six feet tall, while he believes himself to be healthy.",
        "We shall delay until the section on intensional objects below any question as to whether the system's John and John's own could be different entities.",
        "This basic situation is represented pictorially as follows: The more complete environment for the system's view of John's view of himself can be generated by trying to ascribe the beliefs from the system's topic environment about John to the topic environment about John within John's viewpoint (where, as always, the last expression must be glossed as \"the system's view of..\").",
        "One of the two beliefs survives the attempt but the other is blocked, giving the following state:",
        "We see that in examples of this sort, where the topic is also the agent into whose environment an ascription is being attempted, propositions in an outer topic environment E are pushed inwards into a topic environment (for the same topic) within a viewpoint nested within E. Such inward pushing is central to our later observations of intensional identification and metaphor.",
        "The above example demonstrates the basic ascription algorithm and a simple case of ascriptions being blocked.",
        "However, belief ascription is a far more complex phenomenon and the key to our method is the delimitation and treatment of cases where the default algorithm is incorrect.",
        "But even the default algorithm itself requires for its operation a notion of blocking beyond that of explicit contradiction: for example, the proposition Healthy(John) should be able to block Sick(John)\", if Sick and Healthy are known to be incompatible predicates.",
        "Similarly, we appeal below to blocking that arises from incompatible function values, as in the blocking of \"Eye-colour(Frank) = Green\" by \"Eye-colour(Frank) = Blue\".",
        "The more significant complication is that there is an entire class of beliefs that require the opposite of the default ascription rule given above.",
        "We call these atypical beliefs and they include technical expertise, self-knowledge (itself a form of expertise), and secrets.",
        "For example, beliefs that I have about myself, such as how many fillings I have in my teeth, are beliefs that I would not normally ascribe to someone else unless I had reason to do so (if, say, the person, to whom I was ascribing the belief, was my dentist).",
        "A representation based on lambda expressions is used in dealing with atypical beliefs, and is described elsewhere (Ballim, 1987; Ballim & Wilks, forthcoming; Wilks & Ballim, 1987), and follows a suggestion originally made by McCarthy and Hayes (1969).",
        "This combination of a basic default ascription rule, augmented by a mechanism for dealing with atypical belief, is an original algorithm and has not, to our knowledge, been described or tested elsewhere in the literature.",
        "The essential feature of this notation is that lambda-expressions, as in the following example Cure – for (tuberculosis) ) is ((fix (Cure – for x)) tuberculosis ) can only be evaluated by qualified believers (e.g., physicians in this case) in appropriate environments.",
        "Yet anyone can believe the Fregean triviality that the above sentence expresses unevaluated (and it is vital that they can) but a non",
        "trivial interpretation can only be placed on it by those who can evaluate the lambda expression in an environment.",
        "In a crude sense therefore, the lambda-expressions correspond to intensional representations and their evaluations, when available, to extensions, or at least other intensions in those situations where the evaluation of such an expression produces yet another lambda expression (see also Maida 1983).",
        "The above expression, for example, might evaluate to another lambda expression using a predicate Sulfonamide-drug, for whose evaluation a particular drug might be an appropriate.",
        "Each evaluation would require an environment whose \"holder\" was qualified to perform it.",
        "It is really this possibility of successive evaluations of expressions that justifies the abstraction capacity of the lambda notation, since it could well result in expressions, such as a conjunction of predicates, for which there is no single predicate name.",
        "In conclusion, it is this general mechanism in Viewgen that deals with the problem of the over-application of the main default rule of ascription, since the ascription of unevaluable expressions, about, say, the number of my own teeth to you, does not lead to undesirable results.",
        "Intensional Objects and Their Identification It is natural in a system of partitioned environment notation to treat environment boxes as intensional objects: to treat the Jim-object, pushed down into the Frank-object, as not just yielding by computation a set of beliefs that is Frank'sview-of-Jim, but also as a sort of intensional object we might call Jim-for-Frank.",
        "Let us now consider two simple cases of intensional objects and see how the basic default algorithm deals with them: CASE 1 (or Two-for-me-one-for-you): The system believes that Frank and Jim's-father are two people, but that Mary, whose point of view is being computed, believes them to be the same person.",
        "CASE 2 (or One-for-me-two-for-you): Mary believes Frank and Jim's-father to be separate people, whereas the system believes them to be the same individual.",
        "Scenarios such as these are common, and arise over such mundane matters as believing or not believing that Johns-house is the same as the house-on-the-corner-of-X-and-Y-streets.",
        "Two-for-me-one-for-you Processing of first case will begin with the system having three topic environments: for Frank, Jim's-father and Mary.",
        "Two questions that arise are: What intensional object(s) should Mary's viewpoint contain?",
        "And what should be the beliefs about those intensional objects?",
        "Let us say that the system has beliefs about Frank and Jim's father as shown below.",
        "The first question can be rephrased as \"given certain intensional objects in one viewpoint (the system, in this case), what are the corresponding intensional objects in the system's version of another viewpoint (Mary's)?\"",
        "Extending the normal default rule for belief ascription to cope with intensional object ascription, we would say, naturally enough, that intensional objects in one environment directly correspond to intensional objects in another environment, unless there is counter evidence to believing this.",
        "This notion of correspondence of intensional objects between environments can be expressed as beliefs, but these beliefs must be of a type different from those we have previously discussed.",
        "Although it is true that beliefs about intensional correspondence are beliefs about someone, for instance that the system believes about Mary that her intensional objects correspond to its own in a particular way, they clearly cannot be",
        "beliefs of Mary herself.",
        "Referring to our particular example, we say that the system's belief that Mary has a single intensional object corresponding to the system's Frank and Jim's-father objects is a belief for Mary.",
        "These beliefs of intensional correspondence are beliefs of one agent that describe how the agent's intensional objects correspond to intensional objects for another agent.",
        "Thus, they shall be referred to as beliefs for an agent P, and we shall place them in a separate partition as diagrams below will illustrate.",
        "A reader might feel here that there is no need for an additional box type, but further reflection may correct this.",
        "This relationship cannot be captured by co-reference (as opposed to what we are calling correspondence) since within these intensional contexts entities are not coreferential, ex hypothesi.",
        "The For-box (see Fig.",
        "below, where it should be noted that the ordered arguments that correspond for-Mary are precisely not Konolige's \"views\", even though the notation is the same.",
        "In the case at hand (CASE 1), Mary's viewpoint ends up containing a single intensional object 0 (a topic environment) corresponding both to the system's Frank object (topic environment) and to the system's Jim's-father object (topic environment).",
        "The question now is to decide what should be put inside the environment 0.",
        "One possibility is to combine the information in the system's Frank and Jim's-father objects symmetrically, removing any conflicting information.",
        "In the present case, this would result in 0 stating that Frank/Jim's-father is male and tall, but stating neither that he has blue eyes nor that he has green eyes.",
        "However, we claim that in realistic situations it will often be more appropriate to take an asymmetrical view, in which we choose to give precedence either (i) to the information in the system's Frank object over the information in the system's Jim's-father object, or (ii) vice versa.",
        "Choice (i) reflects the presumption that there is a stronger or closer correspondence between Mary's idea of Frank and the system's idea of Frank than there is between her idea of Frank and the system's idea of Jim's father.",
        "This difference of closeness would be plausible, for instance, if the system regarded Mary's view of Frank as being essentially the same as its own except in making the (presumed) mistake of taking Frank to have the property of being Jim's father.",
        "Choice (ii) reflects the converse presumption, which would be most likely to arise from a hypothesis that Mary is focussing on the person-description \"father of Jim\", and that she happens to hold that this description identifies Frank.",
        "Our claim is that in realistic situations there is more likely to be a reason for making one of these choices than to take the symmetrical approach.",
        "We handle the asymmetrical choices as follows.",
        "For choice (i), the system constructs an intensional object 0 called \"Frank-as-Jim's-father\" inside Mary's viewpoint.",
        "This object is so-called because it is, so to speak, \"the Jim's-father view of Frank\" (according to Mary).",
        "Notice that we are not here saying that the object is the view of Frank that Jim's father holds (according to Mary); rather, the object is a view of Frank that is coloured by the idea that he is Jim's father.",
        "This way of regarding Mary's intensional object 0 is directly reflected in the proposed process for constructing 0, as we shall see in a moment.",
        "Mary's Frank-as-Jim's-father object, 0, arises in two stages, as follows.",
        "(la) Initially, a copy of the system's Frank object (topic environment) is placed inside the Jim's-father object (topic environment), as shown in the next figure.",
        "Intuitively, the idea so far is that we have not yet tried to identify Frank as Jim's father, but have merely established a view of Frank that is, so to speak, in the context of Jim's father.",
        "That context does not have an effect until substage (lb).",
        "(lb) We now respect the required identification of Frank as Jim's father.",
        "We try to push the beliefs in the system's Jim's-father object into the Frank object embedded within it, using the ordinary default rule, with the slight modification that Jim's-father is replaced by Frank in a pushed belief.",
        "Thus, the beliefs that Jim's father is male and is tall are successfully pushed in (although the former happens to duplicate a belief already in the embedded Frank object), but the belief that Jim's father has green eyes is blocked by the blue-eye belief already in the embedded Frank object.",
        "(lc) The final substage in constructing the system's Frank-as-Jim's-father object 0' is to pull out the Frank object that is embedded within the Jim's-father object, making it into an object (topic environment) 0' at top level within the system's viewpoint.",
        "In doing this we replace the \"Frank\" topic-name by the name \"Frank-as-Jim's-father\", and similarly change the Frank symbols inside the environment to Frank-as-Jim's-father.",
        "The following diagram shows the result, with the arrow notation indicating the pull-out process.",
        "Stage 2: We now ascribe the system's beliefs about Frank as Jim's father – that is, the beliefs inside 0' – to Mary, once again using the ordinary default rule.",
        "On the assumption that there is no prior information about Mary's view of Frank/Jim's-father (e.g. that his eyes are brown), all that will happen is that a copy 0 of 0' will be created inside the Mary viewpoint, giving the revised Mary-viewpoint shown in the following figure.",
        "If we had had prior information from discourse input that Mary believes the person's eyes to be brown, then there would already have been a Frank-as-Jim's-father object (topic environment) 0 inside Mary's viewpoint, and the beliefs in 0' would all have got pushed into that object except for the green-eye belief.",
        "If the system had decided to give precedence to the Jim's father information rather than to the Frank information in doing the intensional identification (that is, if it had made choice (ii) above) then it would have generated the following state by an analogous process:",
        "It might be thought that a symmetric intensional object, with the feature differences appearing as disjunctions (e.g Eye_color Blue OR Green) would be appropriate as a construct for the Mary environment.",
        "We suggest that this is in fact psychologically less plausible, and that subjects do construct stronger, and more refutable, hypotheses.",
        "A final important thing to notice about the process described above is that the crucial pushing of information from the Jim's-father environment into the embedded Frank environment (or vice versa) is exactly the type of \"inward\" pushing used in the basic examples with which we illustrated basic belief ascription in section 2.",
        "In Sections 6 and 8 we shall seek to show that belief ascription (e.g. Jim's-father's-view-of-Frank), intensional identification (e.g. Frank-as-Jim's-father), and even metaphor are all different forms of a single fundamental computational process.",
        "Treatment of CASE 2: One-for-me-two-for-you In the second case, where the system believes in one individual but Mary two, then the natural computation of Mary's view of either Frank or Jim's-father is simply to push the system's single representation, changing \"Frank\" to \"Jim's-father\" as necessary.",

        "He may therefore choose to ignore the G2's analysis and assume, for instance that the division will play no major part in the battle - i.e. for planning purposes it does not exist.",
        "His guidance will the reflect this interpretation, providing one level of inconsistency between this guidance and MGR's (or the G2's) output.",
        "Now assume that one of Blue's division commanders is a little \"trigger happy\" and is itching for a skirmish.",
        "He could detect the Corps commander's discounting of the stangely behaving Red division, and choose to bend the orders sufficiently to force an encounter with it.",
        "His orders will then reflect another level of inconsistency, this time with the Corps commander's guidance.",
        "He may, for instance, believe that the rogue division is an easy target, even though his orders are to ignore it.",
        "ViewGen can handle this multiply nested set of inconsistencies, and with MGR ouptut as the impartial 'base base' can give judgements as to the direction of the inconsistencies, withiout prejudging the rights or wrongs of the case.",
        "Without MGR the only judgements that can be made are relative, and might be of little use in a real case.",
        "Several questions come to mind as to how to proceed.",
        "Firstly, whereas MGR produces interpretations according to a default set of ideas about Red doctrine and how to handle raw data, the belief spaces of individuals is much harder to capture and to model.",
        "ViewGen cannot create beliefs, only modify statements according to a system of belief already captured and represented.",
        "Secondly, The text messages that are handed down the chain of command may not turn out to adequately reflect the influence of the agent's belief space, and that another round of interpretation may be called for before they can be used by ViewGen.",
        "Our preliminary examination of sample Commander's guidance messages is inconclusive in this regard.",
        "Thirdly, although Red doctrine is reasonably easy to represent, beliefs about how it should be used may not be.",
        "MGR presents a fairly neutral view of this, preferring to err on the side of producing too may models that can be filtered out later, rather than missing a potentially important alternative.",
        "These differences in inference strategy can be incorporated into ViewGen's evaluation mechanisms, but exactly how is an issue for further research."
