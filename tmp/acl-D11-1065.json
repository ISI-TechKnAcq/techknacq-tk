        "Users with certain communication disabilities rely on augmented and alternative communication (AAC) devices to take part in everyday conversations.",
        "Often these devices consist of a predictive text input method coupled with text-to-speech output.",
        "Unfortunately, the text entry rates provided by",
        "AAC devices are typically low, between 0.5 and 16 words-per-minute (Trnka et al., 2009).",
        "As a consequence, researchers have made numerous efforts to increase AAC text entry rates by employing a variety of improved language modeling techniques.",
        "Examples of approaches include adapting the language model to recently used words (Wandmacher et al., 2008; Trnka, 2008), using syntactic information (Hunnicutt, 1989; Garay-Vitoria and Gonzalez-Abascal, 1997), using semantic information (Wandmacher and Antoine, 2007; Li and Hirst, 2005), and modeling topics (Lesher and Rinkus, 2002; Trnka et al., 2006).",
        "For a recent survey, see Garay-Vitoria and Abascal (2006).",
        "While such language model improvement techniques are undoubtedly helpful, certainly they can all benefit from starting with a long-span language model trained on large amounts of closely matched data.",
        "For AAC devices this means closely modeling everyday face-to-face communications.",
        "However, a long-standing problem in the field is the lack of good data sources that adequately model such AAC communications.",
        "Due to privacy-reasons and other ethical concerns, there is no large dataset consisting of genuine AAC messages.",
        "Therefore, previous research has used transcripts of telephone conversations or newswire text.",
        "However, these data sources are unlikely to be an ideal basis for AAC language models.",
        "In this paper we show that it is possible to significantly improve conversational AAC language modeling by first crowdsourcing the creation of a fictional collection of AAC messages on the Amazon Mechanical Turk microtask market.",
        "Using a care-",
        "Due to a medical condition or accident, imagine you can't talk or type on a normal keyboard.",
        "Instead, you use a special communication device that speaks for you.",
        "You operate this device by pushing a burton whenever your desired letter is highlighted.",
        "By repeatedly pushing the button, you can spell out words, phrases or entire sentences.",
        "Invent a fictitious (but plausible) communication you might make using your device.",
        "Think of the things you might want to say to your family, friends, caregivers, and people you meet in the community.",
        "Please proceed quickly and accurately.",
        "Do NOT include any private information (such as real email addresses, phone numbers, or names).",
        "Invent a new communication for each task of this type.",
        "Write as if you were actually using your communication device to speak for you.",
        "Do NOT write about your actions or state of mind.",
        "fully designed microtask we collected 5890 messages from 298 unique workers.",
        "As we will see, word-for-word these fictional AAC messages are better at predicting AAC test sets than a wide-range of other text sources.",
        "Further, we demonstrate that Twitter, blog and Usenet data outperform telephone transcripts or newswire text.",
        "While our crowdsourced AAC data is better than other text sources, it is too small to train high-quality long-span language models.",
        "We therefore investigate how to use our crowdsourced collection to intelligently select AAC-like sentences from Twitter, blog and Usenet data.",
        "We compare a variety of different techniques for doing this intelligent selection.",
        "We find that the best selection technique is the recently proposed cross-entropy difference method (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "Using this method, we build a compact and well-performing mixture model from the Twitter, blog and Usenet sentences most similar to our crowdsourced data.",
        "We evaluate our mixture model on four different test sets.",
        "On the three most AAC-like test sets, we found substantial reductions in not only perplexity but also in potential keystroke savings when used in a predictive keyboard interface.",
        "Finally, to aid other AAC researchers, we have publicly released our crowdsourced AAC collection, word lists and best-performing language models."

        "While crowdsourcing is commonly used for simple human computation tasks, such as labeling images and transcribing audio, it is an open research question whether we can leverage workers' creativity to invent plausible and useful AAC-like messages.",
        "In this section, we describe our carefully constructed microtask and compare how well our collected messages correspond to communications from actual AAC users.",
        "To collect our data, we used two different types of human intelligence tasks (HITs).",

        "We removed communications with an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of over 20% with respect to a large word list of 330K words obtained from human-edited dictionaries.",
        "We also removed communications that were all in upper case, contained common texting abbreviations (e.g. \"plz\", \"ru\", \"2day\"), communications over 80 characters, and communications with excessive letter repetitions (e.g. \"yippeeee\").",
        "After cleaning, we had 5890 messages from 298 unique workers.",
