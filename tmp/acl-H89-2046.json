        "Systems for the automatic recognition of speech have in recent years derived many ideas and strategies from observations of the structure and processing modes of the nervous system, and specifically of the mammalian auditory system.",
        "Examples range from the adoption of cochlear-like processing as front-end analysis stages, to the use of artificial neural networks as adaptive pattern recognizers.",
        "For the last five years, we have been studying the functions and algorithms that facilitate the remarkable abilities of the auditory system to analyze, recognize, and localize complex sounds such as speech, music, and other environmental sounds.",
        "We have developed and used biophysical and computational models of the peripheral cochlear stages, of the intermediate central neural networks that extract various feature representations of the acoustic stimulus (e.g., as in speech phonemes), and of networks for the recognition of temporally ordered sequences (such as words and sentences).",
        "These models have been described in detail in [1,2,3,4,5].",
        "Here, we shall outline a few of our recent investigations and the results that we have obtained."

        "Cochlear models in various forms are now commonly used in speech recognition systems.",
        "In many cases, they are severely simplified to reduce computational complexity, preserving only salient features of the original models, e.g., the psuedo-logarithmic frequency axis, critical-band filters, and the fast and/or slow adaptation (as AGCs).",
        "These and other processing steps have been justified in many elaborate and detailed experiments.",
        "One of the most desired features of cochlear processing has been robustness to noise, specifically, their supposed ability to provide a stable representation of the speech signal over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.",
        "Results from a few studies have so far been equivocal for many reasons, primary among them is the complexity of the systems tested which precluded clear separation of the causes of improvements and degradations.",
        "We have compared the noise immunity of cochlear representations to that of linear predictor coefficients (LPC), LPC cepstral coefficients, and discrete time Fourier Transform (DFT) spectra.",
        "Specifically, three investigations are performed: first, the distortion of each representation due to additive white noise is measured; in the second experiment, the robustness is measured through the deterioration in the vector quantizer performance of each representation; and finally, in the third experiment we measure the ability of each representation to discriminate speech sounds in noise.",
        "Ninety sentences spoken by ten male speakers are taken from the phonetically labeled Icecream database and transformed into each of the four representations after upsampling from 16KHz to 20KHz (the cochlear model requires a 20KHz sampling rate).",
        "The cochlear model followed by two stages of lateral inhibition",
        "[1] produces vectors of 128 tonotopically ordered elements from the 100Hz to 10KHz region of the basilar membrane.",
        "For all representations, a 20ms frame and 8ms step size are used, and, except for the cochlear model, a preemphasis of 1.0 and a Hamming window are applied.",
        "The Log Area Ratios are obtained from the LPC coefficients of an order 28 predictor found via the autocorrelation method.",
        "The Log Area Ratios are used because of their appropriateness for vector quantization and mean square distortion measurements.",
        "The LPC cepstral coefficients are also computed via autocorrelation and the quefrency ranged from 0.0625 ms to 3.0625 ms.",
        "The spectrum is computed by a 256 point FFT with zero padding.",
        "In the tests performed, noisy speech is obtained by adding white gaussian noise of the appropriate amplitude to the clean speech.",
        "The slight oversampling of the speech is taken into account in determining the noise amplitude.",

        "For the LPC and LPC cepstrum, all eigenvectors are retained.",
        "Note that if all eigenvectors are retained IIK(F(s)) – K(F(s+n))112 = IIF(s) – F(s+n)112 so the transform does not affect the distortion computation for the LPC and LPC cepstrum, and in practice, the spectral distortion is not reduced by the change in dimension.",

        "Why is the cochlear representation performance superior to other representations?",

        "Compression produces a well know effect of enhancing a signal in a noisy background (see [3]).",
        "In the cochlear models it is possible to apply strong compression without loss of spectral detail because the spectral information is encoded in the phase locked responses.",
        "The LIN utilizes this phase locking to extract a robust spectral estimate that can tolerate extreme compression.",
        "Such compression is not feasible for spectrogram representations since it completely destroys the spectral peaks and valleys."

        "At the center, units with narrow and symmetric inhibitory sidebands predominate.",

        "These columns are analogous to the well known orientation columns of the visual system.",

        "analogous to phase-locked loops, where the network locks onto an incoming sequence and predicts one state ahead.",

        "The system is based on a nonlinear recurrent lateral inhibitory network operating in a hysteresis mode which functions as a pattern generator.",
        "The network consists of a single layer of reciprocally and strongly inhibited neurons.",
        "The profile of connectivities is designed such that the patterns of the desired sequence are stable states of the network outputs.",

        "In order to control the order and rate of this process, integrating excitatory connections are formed that project from the elements of one pattern to the elements of the succeeding pattern.",
        "Only one time-constant of integration is used for all connections in the network.",
        "The varying durations of the sequence patterns are encoded not as different time constants but as different widths of the hysteresis loops between the different patterns, i.e. through the magnitudes of the inhibitory connectivities in the network.",
        "The proposed network can be readily used as a recognizer of sequences applied to its input.",
        "The key concept here is the degree of correspondence between the applied input and the internally predicted state of the network.",
        "This measure is used to modulate the mode of operation in the network between a free-cycling mode when the correspondence is high, and an input-dominated mode when it is low.",
        "The measure is a state-dependent function derived during training, similar to a likelihood function.",
        "Thus, this measure can also be used as an indicator of the match between the applied sequence and the sequence generated by the network.",
        "When the confidence is relatively high and the network is free-cycling, it automatically substitutes missing patterns and is rather insensitive to small irregularities of the input temporal durations.",
        "Therefore, in such a scheme, no time-warping is needed."
