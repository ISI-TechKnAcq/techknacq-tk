        "We propose a supervised lexical substitution system that does not use separate classifiers per word and is therefore applicable to any word in the vocabulary.",
        "Instead of learning word-specific substitution patterns, a global model for lexical substitution is trained on delexicalized (i.e., non lexical) features, which allows to exploit the power of supervised methods while being able to generalize beyond target words in the training set.",
        "This way, our approach remains technically straightforward, provides better performance and similar coverage in comparison to unsupervised approaches.",
        "Using features from lexical resources, as well as a variety of features computed from large corpora (n-gram counts, distributional similarity) and a ranking method based on the posterior probabilities obtained from a Maximum Entropy classifier, we improve over the state of the art in the LexSub Best-Precision metric and the Generalized Average Precision measure.",
        "Robustness of our approach is demonstrated by evaluating it successfully on two different datasets."

        "In recent years, the task of automatically providing lexical substitutions in context (McCarthy and Nav-igli, 2007) received much attention.",
        "The premise to be able to replace words in a sentence without changing its meaning gave rise to applications like linguistic steganography (Topkara et al., 2006; Chang and Clark, 2010), semantic text similarity (Agirre et al., 2012), and plagiarism detection (Gipp et al., 2011).",
        "Lexical substitution, a special form of contextual paraphrasing where only a single word is replaced, is closely related to word sense disambiguation (WSD): polysemous words have possible substitutions reflecting several senses, and the correct sense has to be picked to avoid spurious system be-havior.",
        "However, no explicit word sense inventory is required for lexical substitution (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "The prominent tasks in a lexical substitution system are generation and ranking, i.e. to generate a set of possible substitutions for the target word and then to rank this set of possible substitutions according to their contextual fitness.",
        "The task to generate a high quality set of possible substitutions is challenging in itself, for two reasons.",
        "First, the available lexical resources are seldom complete in listing synonyms.",
        "Second, manually annotated substitutions show that not all synonyms of a word are appropriate in a given context, and many good substitutions have other lexical relation than synonymy to the original word.",
        "In this work, we present a supervised lexical substitution system that, unlike the usual lexical sample supervised approaches, can produce substitutions for targets that are not contained in the training material.",
        "We reach this by using non-lexical features from heterogeneous evidence, including lexical-semantic resources and distributional similarity, n-gram and shallow syntactic features based on large, unannotated background corpora.",
        "In light of the existence of lexical resources such as Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998) or machine readable dictionaries that can serve as the source for lexical information, and with the ever-increasing availability of large unannotated corpora for many languages and",
        "domains, our proposal enables us to leverage the quality gain of supervised machine learning while generalizing over a large vocabulary through the avoidance of lexicalized features.",
        "Using a single classifier for all substitution targets in this way results in an all-words substitution system.",
        "As our results demonstrate, our model improves over the state of the art in lexical substitution with practically no open parameters that have to be optimized and selected carefully according to the dataset at hand."

        "Previous works in lexical substitution either address both the generation and the ranking tasks, and are therefore applicable to any word without pre-labeled data (c.f.",
        "the Semeval 2007 task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) and related work) or focus on the more challenging ranking step only (c.f.",
        "Erk and Pado?",
        "(2008) and related work).",
        "The latter approaches take the list of possible substitutions directly from the testing data as a workaround to generating the possible substitutions, and merely evaluate the ranking capabilities of these methods.",
        "The most accurate lexical substitution systems use supervised machine learning to train (and test) a separate classifier per target word, using lexical and shallow syntactic features.",
        "These systems rely on the existence of a large number of annotated examples (i.e. sentences together with the contextually valid substitutions) for each word.",
        "Biemann (2012) describes a supervised lexical substitution system for frequent nouns.",
        "Exploiting a large amount of sense tagged examples and (sense-specific) data annotated with substitutions, an accurate coarse-grained WSD model is trained and then the most frequent substitutions of the predicted sense are assigned to the new occurrences of the target words.",
        "The results demonstrate that lexical substitution of noun targets can be attained with very high precision (over 90%) if sufficient training material is available.",
        "However, due to high annotation costs, methods that do not require labeled training data per target scale better to a large vocabulary.",
        "Knowledge-based systems like e.g. by Hassan et al.",
        "(2007), who use a number of knowledge-based and unsupervised methods and combine these clues using a voting scheme, do not need training data per target.",
        "The combination of different signals, however, has to be done manually.",
        "Unsupervised systems that rely on distributional similarity (Thater et al., 2011) or topic models (Li et al., 2010) are single signals in this sense, and their development is guided by the performance and observations on standard datasets.",
        "Such signals, however, can also be kept simple avoiding any task-specific optimization and can be integrated in a single model for all words using a limited amount of training data and delexicalized features, as in Senselearner (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005) for weakly supervised all-words disambiguation.",
        "This way, task specific development can be replaced by a machine learning component and the resulting model applies also to unseen words, similar to the knowledge-based approaches."

        "Related works that address the lexical substitution problem according to the settings established by the English Lexical Substitution Task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) at Semeval 2007 (LexSub) typically employ a simple ranking strategy based on local n-gram frequencies and focus on finding an optimal source of possible substitutions, as the selection of lexical resources has largest impact on the overall system performance: Sinha and Mihalcea (2009) systematically explored the benefits of multiple lexical resources and found that a supervised combination of several resources lead to statistically significant improvements in accuracy (about 3.5% points over the best single resource, WordNet).",
        "They tested LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990), ESA (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) and n-gram frequencies for contextualization and found n-gram frequencies to be more effective than dimensionality reduction techniques by a large margin.",
        "Their improvements were obtained by supervised learning on the combination of several lexical resources.",
        "Our work, on the other hand, is concerned with using more advanced features and we obtain significant improvements based on a diverse set of features and a different learning setup: we train a model for contextualization, rather than to combine substitutions from several different resources.",
        "A recent work by Sinha and Mihalcea (2011) used an approach based on graph centrality to rank the candidates and achieved comparable performance",
        "to n-gram-frequency-based ranking.",
        "To summarize, the use of n-gram frequencies for ranking and WordNet as the (most appropriate single) source of synonyms is competitive to more complex solutions and provides a simple and strong lexical substitution system.",
        "This motivated the follow-up work by Chang and Clark (2010) to use WordNet and n-grams in a linguistic steganography application and this motivates us to use this method as our baseline."

        "While this approach provides good results with relatively simple and transparent models, each occurrence of a word has a unique representation (that can only be computed at testing time), and it is computationally expensive to scale these models to a large number of examples.",
        "Dinu and Lapata (2010) used a bag of words latent variable model to characterize the meaning of a word as a distribution over a set of latent variables (that is, probabilistic senses).",

        "A similar approach has been evaluated for word similarity (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010a) and word sense disambiguation (Li et al., 2010).",

        "In this study, we presented a supervised approach to all-words lexical substitution based on delexicalized features, which enables us to fully exploit the power of supervised models while ensuring applicability to a large, open vocabulary.",
        "Results demonstrate the feasibility of this method: our MaxEnt-based ranking approach improved over the baseline in all settings and yielded ?",
        "to our knowledge ?",
        "the best scores for lexical substitution with automatically gathered synonyms on the Semeval 2007 LexSub dataset.",
        "Also, it performed slightly better than the state of the art for candidates pooled from the gold standard without any parameter tuning or empirical design choices.",
        "In this study, we established transparency between Semeval-style and ranking-only studies in lexical substitution ?",
        "two lines of work that were difficult to compare in the past.",
        "Further, we observe similar improvements on two different datasets, showing the robustness of the approach.",
        "While previous works showed the potential of more/improved lexical resources for lexical substitution, we improved over the best Semeval-style performance just by exploiting an improved ranking model over a standard WordNet-based candidate set.",
        "These results indicate that improvements from lexical resources and better ranking models are additive, thus we want to add more lexical resources in our system in the future.",
        "Of course there are several other ways to improve further the work described here.",
        "First of all, similar to the best ranking approaches (e.g. Thater et al. (2011)), one could use contextualized feature functions to make global information from the distributional thesaurus more accurate.",
        "Instead of using globally calculated similarities, information from the distributional thesaurus could be contextualized via constraining the statistics with words from the context.",
        "Other natural ways to improve the model described here are to make heavier use of parser information or to employ pairwise or list-wise machine learning models (Cao et al., 2007), which are specifically designed for subset ranking.",
        "Lastly, while intrinsic evaluation of lexical substitution is important, we would like to show its practicability in tasks such as steganography or information retrieval."
