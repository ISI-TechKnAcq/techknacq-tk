        "On the other hand, the various approaches show a considerable overlap in the individual relations adopted, thus suggesting a \"common ground\" shared by all approaches.",
        "For the aims of our research, rather than committing to one or another interpretation of discourse relations, we have abstracted from the various taxonomies three broad classes or types of relations, namely an additive type, a consequential type, and a contrastive type.",

        "A relation was considered to be correctly inferred when the spontaneous label chosen matched our taxonomy-based classification.",
        "Those cases where the relation was not correctly",
        "retrieved were further classified in uncertainty instances and confusion instances (i.e., when subjects attributed the relation to a different class).",
        "Table 1 illustrates the data for each of the three classes of coherence relations.",
        "The degree of correctness in the answers is taken to be representative of the degree of comprehension of the relations.",
        "The data confirm our hypothesis that a connective facilitates the interpreters ability to infer the relation intended by the message sender.",
        "For all types of relations, the absence of the connective corresponds to a reduction in the number of correct answers.",
        "However, this reduction displays distinct patterns according to the type of relation involved.",
        "The contrastive type shows the highest reduction, while the additive type the lowest.",
        "The consequential type holds an intermediate position.",
        "Similarly, the different types of relations are not equally affected by the presence/absence of a connective: additive relations seem to be less comprehensible than contrastive and consequential relations; however, they are those which are best comprehended when lexical signalling is missing.",
        "The difficulty with which a contrastive relation is inferred without a connective could be due to the fact that lexical marking is essential for the inference of the contrastive component of meaning.",
        "According to our hypothesis, the contrastive type should be cognitively more complex than the other two, since it involves an additional negative component.",
        "If there is lack of marking, the negative or contrastive component of the relation is lost and the relation is thus interpreted as an additive or consequential relation, according to the underlying type, as it is shown by the redistribution into these other two classes.",
        "Lexical marking seems not to have a fundamental role for guiding the inference of additive relations: in fact, there is only a slight difference between the number of correct answers in the condition with connective and those in the condition without connective.",
        "This could be due to two different, non competing factors: first, it could be that additive connectives are not particularly efficient for guiding the inference of the relation because of their intrinsic ambiguity.",
        "Second, it could also be the case that interpreters tend to instantiate whenever possible a \"stronger\" implicational relation between two segments.",
        "Numerous studies (cf., among others, Townsend and Bever, 1978; Trabasso and Sperry, 1985; Trabasso and van den Broek, 1987; Garnharn et al., 1996; Noordinan and Vonk, 1997) suggest that the various types of relations differ not only along the dimension of cognitive complexity, but also along the dimension of cognitive relevance.",
        "According to these studies, causal and temporal relations are cognitively more relevant since they promote the storage in memory of the connection between information.",
        "On the other hand, the ease with which an additive relation is inferred when there is no lexical marking to signal it could be explained by the fact that a relation of this type is inferred by default, since it signals a simple and general continuation without any other particular connotation.",
        "Consequential relations, while showing a reduction in the number of correct answers from the condition with connective to the condition without connective, display a relative ease of comprehension.",
        "This is not plausibly explained by making reference to the basic common knowledge shared by writers and readers, since this should determine a good recognition of contrastive relations as well.",
        "It is more advantageous to hypothesise that the high degree of understanding of consequential relations is related to the well-known preference toward inferring an itn-plicational relation between the segments (cf. for example Black and Bern, 1981).",
        "Again, the fact that this class of relations is the best comprehended one whith lexical signalling is explainable in terms of semantic non-ambiguity of the connectives usually",
        "employed for its expression.",
        "In sum, Experiment I. supports the hypothesis that connectives have a facilitating effect for the inference of the relations intended by the message sender.",
        "The fact that not all types of relations are equally facilitated by a connective has been interpreted as the result of three different phenomena: a) semantic ambiguity of connectives for the additive class vs. non-ambiguity of connectives for the consequential and contrastive classes; b) higher cognitive complexity of the contrastive type of relations and hence necessity of connectives for the understanding of the contrastive meaning; c) different cognitive relevance of the different classes of relations."

        "On the other hand, the additive type has a very low rate of lexical signalling (around 20%).",
        "In addition, the figures show that reduction in the degree of lexical signalling significatively concerns the consequential type only (- 16.3%), while the contrastive type is only slightly affected (-3.6%); more importantly, reduction does not concern the additive type, which shows an opposite tendency toward an increase in the global percentage of lexical marking (+3.2%).",
        "The fact that a contrastive relation is almost always marked by a connective, either in speaking and in writing, indicates that connectives are obligatory for this class.",
        "This is again in accordance with the hypothesis of a higher cognitive complexity for this kind of relations.",
        "In production, thus, higher cognitive complexity imposes a constraint in the form of an obligation to lexically signal the relation (this also indicates that graphic and punctuation markers are felt as inadequate for a correct retrieval of the relation).",

        "For the additive and consequential types, thus, the data show an influence of the means of expression in terms of an increased degree of lexical marking for the spoken versions which decreases in the written versions.",
        "This latter phenomenon could be due to the fact that writing has graphic and punctuation marks available in order to signal the relation.",
        "In sum, with reference to our original questions, i.e. a) whether the means of expression (oral vs. written) constrains the type of relations used in the narratives; b) whether any difference could be related to the use, in spoken language, of cognitively less complex relations; c) whether spoken language manifests a tendency toward marking the cognitively more complex relations; and d) whether spoken language shows a significantly higher use of connectives, as a trace of the cognitive processes involved in production, the data from our second experiment suggest the following conclusions.",
