        "Firstly, the limits of the paper do not permit a proper discussion of the pros and cons for each solution pronosed; and furthemore most of these problems have a triadition dating as far back as the Middle Ages, in some cases.",

        "It is now obvious that the human ability to use language is related Closely to intelligence itself.Neverthelesslthe complexitN of hatural language is still rather underestimated by linguists, which results usually in using relatively primitive tools for a formal description of language.",
        "Although such formalisms like e. 6. transformational grammar may be theoretically adequate, from a practical point of view they are too cumbersome; (in my opinion writing a transformational grammar may be only compared with programming a sophisticated system exclusively in an assembly language).",
        "The main merit of Artificial Intelligence for the development of computational linguistics lies in suggesting a quite new way of thinking about language.",
        "It consists in shifting the attention af research from linguistic competence to linguistic perfomance and creating the latter as an operation of a real or imagined language processor, which in turn can be discussed in terms of computer science.Winorad (19722) claims even that the best test of a complex model of natural language is to implement it as language understanding system.",
        "Although he is basically correct, in the present state of",
        "art, the objection posed by Charniak is often valikt.",
        "harniak (1y(2:2) noticed that most programs in Artificial Intelligence handle only a few kinds of selected test examples.",
        "Deciding that a program can be extended in some easily imaginable way to handle more examples or more sophisticated cases reguires practically the same procedure as verifying a non-programmed theory.",
        "Therefore, I treat Winograd's postulate as a long-term aim, and at this moment I advocate a less ambitious strategy: to use as mtUch possible of the computer science intuitions in natural language description.",
        "This is in fact also the approach of Longuet-Higgins (1972) who states that natural language utterances are just programs to be run in our brains.",
        "Some interesting analogies between lahguage understanding and running a POP-2 program have been shown e. g. in (Davies, Isard 1972).",
        "I pursue this approach in another direction, charqcterised by an intensive use of the notion of environment.",
        "In the earlier stage of the inquiry, represented by (Bien 1975), I thought that all the environment manipulations which were necessary for the feasibility of my approach could be realiLed by means of the Bobrow and Ciegbreit multipa environments primitives (1972); therefore, I have introduced the term multiple environments model of natural language .",

        "There are also pointers peculiar to given languages; e. g. after McCawley (197) and Isard (1974) it is reasonable for English to treat the Past tense as a pointer, because (isard 1974) it acts as a form of definite referenne to a past situation on which the attention of the conversants has recently been focussed The presupposttions",
        "often function similarly to pointers, but I think that presuppositions are essentially different from pointers and I prefer to account for them in another way.",

        "First, it can supply values for these pointers which are not assigned by the text itself.",

        "(1) Be careful, he might bite you.",
        "said while the adressee is near a dangerous animal.",
        "Such an utterance can be easily transformed into a textually coherent one by introducing a narrator.",
        "The second type of situational coherency is more subtlelit consists of applying the addressees knowledge to fill up some relations omitted in the sender s message.",
        "This is needed e* g* in the text (Bellert 1972:79)",
        "(2) Ann's eldest son has left Warsaw for a scholarship study in the Sorbonne.",
        "(3) France is an interesting country to study in.",

        "In general, a text is situationally coherent only relative to a given domain of knowledge.",

        "Such a solution agrees with thc tl intuition of Marciszewski (1972:180) that most beliefs are spontaneous and that it is the entertaining of a belief with the awareness of non-accepting that requires a special act of giving up; the suspension of judgement is therefore an act more sophisticated than spontaneous pelief4 The fourth lavel, which I call the integration, should be de12 signed to memorize the facts marked by the judgement level as important enough to be stored.",
