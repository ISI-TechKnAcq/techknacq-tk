        "Writing in a second language (L2) is a challenging and complex process for foreign language learners.",
        "Insufficient lexical knowledge and limited exposure to English might interrupt their writing flow (Silva, 1993).",
        "Numerous writing instructions have been proposed (Kroll, 1990) as well as writing handbooks have been available for learners.",
        "Studies have revealed that during the writing process, EFL learners show the inclination to rely on their native languages (Wolfersberger, 2003) to prevent a breakdown in the writing process (Arndt, 1987; Cumming, 1989).",
        "However, existing writing courses and instruction materials, almost second-language-oriented, seem unable to directly assist EFL writers while writing.",
        "This paper presents FLOW1 (Figure 1), an interactive system for assisting EFL writers in",
        "composing and revising writing.",
        "Different from existing tools, its context-sensitive and first-language-oriented features enable EFL writers to concentrate on their ideas and thoughts without being hampered by the limited lexical resources.",
        "Based on the studies that first language use can positively affect second language composing, FLOW attempts to meet such needs.",
        "Given any L1 input, FLOW displays appropriate suggestions including translation, paraphrases, and n-grams during composing and revising processes.",
        "We use the following example sentences to illustrate these two functionalities.",
        "Consider the sentence ?We propose a method to?.",
        "During the composing stage, suppose a writer is unsure of the phrase ?solve the problem?, he could write ?????",
        "?, a corresponding word in his native language, like ?We propose a method to ?????.",
        "The writer's input in the writing area of FLOW actively triggers a set of translation suggestions such as ?solve the problem?",
        "and ?tackle the problem?",
        "for him/her to complete the sentence.",
        "In the revising stage, the writer intends to improve or correct the content.",
        "He/She is likely to change the sentence illustrated above into ?We try all means to solve the problem.?",
        "He would select the phrase ?propose a method?",
        "in the original sentence and input a L1 phrase ???",
        "?, which specifies the meaning he prefers.",
        "The L1 input triggers a set of context-aware suggestions corresponding to the translations such as ?try our best?",
        "and ?do our best?",
        "rather than ?try your best?",
        "and ?do your best?.",
        "The system is able to do that mainly by taking a context-sensitive approach.",
        "FLOW then inserts the phrase the writer selects into the sentence.",
        "In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive disambiguation model which aims to automatically choose the appropriate phrases in different contexts when performing n-gram prediction, paraphrase suggestion and translation tasks.",
        "As described in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), the disambiguation model plays an important role in the machine translation task.",
        "Similar to their work, we further integrate the multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation model to the n-gram prediction model, paraphrase model and translation model of our system.",
        "With the phrasal disambiguation model, the output of the system is sensitive to the context the writer is working on.",
