        "Conversations are rich in subjectivity.",
        "Conversation participants agree and disagree with one other, argue for and against various proposals, and generally take turns expressing their private states.",
        "Being able to separate these subjective utterances from more objective utterances would greatly facilitate the analysis, mining and summarization of a large number of conversations.",
        "Two of the most prevalent conversational media are meetings and emails.",
        "Face-to-face meetings enable numerous people to exchange a large amount of information and opinions in a short period of time, while emails allow for concise exchanges between potentially far-flung participants.",
        "Meetings and emails can also feed into one another, with face-to-face meetings occurring at regular intervals and emails continuing the conversations in the interim.",
        "This poses several interesting questions, such as whether subjective utterances are more or less likely to be found in email exchanges compared with meetings, and whether the ratios of positive and negative subjective utterances differ between the two modalities.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel approach for predicting subjectivity, and test it in two sets of experiments on meetings and emails.",
        "Our approach combines a new general purpose method for learning subjective patterns, with features that capture basic characteristics of conversation structure across modalities.",
        "The subjective patterns are essentially n-gram sequences with varying levels of lexical instantiation, and we demonstrate how they can be learned from both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "The conversation features capture structural characteristics of multimodal conversations as well as participant information.",
        "We test our approach in two sets of experiments.",
        "The goal of the first set of experiments is to discriminate subjective from non-subjective utterances, comparing the novel approach to existing state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "In the second set of experiments, the goal is to discriminate positive-subjective and negative-subjective utterances, establishing their polarity.",
        "In both sets of experiments, we assess the impact of features relating to conversation structure."

        "In this section we describe our approach to subjectivity detection.",
        "We begin by describing how to learn subjective n-gram patterns with varying levels of lexical instantiation.",
        "We then describe a set of features characterizing multimodal conversation structure which can be used to supplement the n-gram approach.",
        "Finally, we describe the baseline subjectivity detection approaches used for comparison.",
        "Our approach to subjectivity detection and polarity detection is to learn significant patterns that correlate with the subjective and polar utterances.",
        "These patterns are word trigrams, but with varying levels of lexical instantiation, so that each unit of the n-gram can be either a word or the word's part-of-speech (POS) tag.",
        "This contrasts, then, with work such as that of Raaijmakers et al.",
        "(2008) who include trigram features in their experiments, but where their learned trigrams are fully instantiated.",
        "As an example, while they may learn that a trigram really great idea is positive, we may additionally find that really great NN and RB great NN are informative patterns, and these patterns may sometimes be better cues than the fully instantiated trigrams.",
        "To differentiate this approach from the typical use of trigrams, we will refer to it as the VIN {varying instantiation n-grams) method.",
        "In some respects, our approach to subjectivity detection is similar to Riloff and Wiebe's work cited above, in the sense that their extraction patterns are partly instantiated.",
        "However, the AutoSlog-TS approach relies on deriving syntactic structure with the Sundance shallow parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004).",
        "We hypothesize that our trigram approach may be more robust to dis-fluent and fragmented meeting speech and emails on which syntactic parsers may perform poorly.",
        "Also, our learned trigram patterns range from fully instantiated to completely uninstantiated.",
        "For example, we might find that the pattern RB JJ NN is a very good indicator of subjective utterances because it matches a variety of scenarios where people are ascribing qualities to things, e.g. really bad movie, horribly overcooked steak.",
        "Notice that we do not see our approach and AutoSlog-TS as mutually exclusive, and indeed we demonstrate through these experiments that they can be effectively combined.",
        "Our approach begins by running the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1992) over all sentences in a document.",
        "We then extract all of the word trigrams from the document, and represent each trigram using every possible instantiation.",
        "Because we are working at the trigram level, and each unit of the trigram can be a word or its POS tag there are 2 = 8 representations in each trigram's instantiation set.",
        "To continue the example from above, the instantiation set for the trigram really great idea is given in Table 1.",
        "As we scan down the instantiation set, we can see that the level of abstraction increases until it is completely uninstantiated.",
        "It is this multilevel abstraction that we are hypothesizing will be useful for learning new subjective and polar cues.",
        "All trigrams are then scored according to their prevalence in relevant versus irrelevant documents (e.g. subjective vs. non-subjective sentences), following the scoring methodology of Riloff and Wiebe (2003).",
        "We calculate the conditional probability p(relevance\\trigram) using the actual trigram counts in relevant and irrelevant text.",
        "For learning negative-subjective patterns, we treat all negative sentences as the relevant text and the remainder of the sentences as irrelevant text, and conduct the same process for learning positive-subjective patterns.",
        "We consider significant patterns to be those where the conditional probability is greater than 0.65 and the pattern occurs more than five times in the entire document set (slightly higher than probability >= 0.60 and frequency >= 2 used by Riloff and Wiebe (2003)).",
        "We possess a fairly small amount of conversational data annotated for subjectivity and polarity.",
        "The AMI meeting corpus and BC3 email corpus are described in more detail in Section 4.1.",
        "To address this shortfall in annotated data, we take two approaches to learning patterns.",
        "In the first, we learn a set of patterns from the annotated conversation data.",
        "In the second approach, we complement those patterns by learning additional patterns from unannotated data that are typically overwhelmingly subjective or objective in nature.",
        "We describe these two approaches here in turn.",
        "The first learning strategy is to apply the above-described methods to the annotated conversation data, learning the positive patterns by comparing positive-subjective utterances to all other utterances, and learning the negative patterns by comparing the negative-subjective utterances to all other utterances, using the described methods.",
        "This results in 759 significant positive patterns and 67 significant negative patterns.",
        "This difference in pattern numbers can be explained by negative utterances being less common in the AMI meetings, as noted by Wilson (2008).",
        "It may be that people are less comfortable in expressing negative sentiments in face-to-face conversations, particularly when the meeting participants do not know each other well (in the AMI scenario meetings, many participants were meeting each other for the first time).",
        "But there may be a further explanation for why we learn many more positive than negative patterns.",
        "When conversation participants do express negative sentiments, they may couch those sentiments in more euphemistic or guarded terms compared with positive sentiments.",

        "Third, there is a huge amount of available blog data.",
        "But because we do not possess blog data annotated for subjectivity, we take the following approach to learning subjective patterns from this data.",
        "We work on the assumption that a great many blog posts are inherently subjective, and that comparing this data to inherently objective text such as newswire articles, treating the latter as our irrelevant text, should lead to the detection of many new subjective patterns and greatly increase our coverage.",
        "While the patterns learned will be noisy, we hypothesize that the increased coverage will improve our subjectivity detection overall.",

        "The portion used totals approximately 4,000 documents on all manner of topics.",
        "Treating that dataset as our relevant, subjective data, we then learn the subjective trigrams by comparing with the irrelevant TAC/DUC newswire data from the 2007 and 2008 update summarization tasks.",
        "To try to reduce the amount of noise in our learned patterns, we set the conditional probability threshold at 0.75 (vs. 0.65 for annotated data), and stipulate that all significant patterns must occur at least once in the irrelevant text.",

        "Pattern p(r\\t)",
        "us from learning completely blog-specific patterns such as posted by NN or linked to DT.",
        "In the end, more than 20,000 patterns were learned from the blog data.",
        "While manual inspection does show that many undesirable patterns were extracted, among the highest-scoring patterns are many sensible subjective trigrams such as those indicated in Table 3.",

        "Without access to labeled biographical data, the authors chose to use sentences from Wikipedia biographies as their positive set and sentences from newswire articles as their negative set, on the assumption that most of the Wikipedia sentences would be relevant to biographies and most of the newswire sentences would not.",
        "For our machine learning experiments, we derive, for each sentence, features indicating the presence of the significant VIN patterns.",
        "Patterns are binned according to their conditional probability range (i.e., 0.65 <= p < 0.75, 0.75 <= p < 0.85, 0.85 <= p < 0.95, and 0.95 <= p).",
        "There are three bins for the blog patterns, since the probability cutoff is 0.75 For each bin, there is a feature indicating the count of its patterns in the given sentence.",
        "When attempting to match these trigram patterns to sentences, we allow up to two wildcard lexical items between the trigram units.",

        "(2008) similarly include an n-gram feature allowing such intervening material).",
        "A key reason for counting the number of matched patterns for each probability range as just described, rather than including a feature for each individual pattern, is to maintain the same level of dimensionality in our machine learning experiments when comparing the VIN approach to the baseline approaches described in Section 3.4.",

        "While we hypothesize that the general purpose pattern-based approach described above will greatly aid subjectivity and polarity detection, we also recognize that there are many additional features specific for characterizing multimodal conversations that may correlate well with subjectivity and polarity.",
        "Such features include structural characteristics like the position of a sentence in a turn and the position of a turn in the conversation, and participant features relating to dominance or leadership.",
        "For example, it may be that subjective sentences are more likely to come at the end of a conversation, or that a person who dominates the conversation may utter more negative sentences.",
        "We use the feature set provided by Murray and Carenini (2008), which they used for automatic summarization of conversations and which are shown in Table 4.",
        "Many of the features are based on so-called Sprob and Tprob term-weights, the former of which weights words based on their distributions across conversation participants and the latter of which similarly weights words based on their distributions across conversation turns.",
        "Other features include word entropy of the candidate sentence, lexical cohesion of the sentence with the greater conversation, and structural features indicating position of the candidate sentence in the turn and in the conversation, such as the elapsed time since the beginning of the conversation.",
        "There are two baselines in particular to which we are interested in comparing the VIN approach.",
        "As stated earlier, we are hypothesizing that the increasing levels of abstraction found with partially instantiated trigrams will lead to improved classification compared with using only fully instantiated trigrams.",
        "To test this, we also run the subjective/non-subjective and positive/negative experiments using only fully instantiated trigrams.",
        "There are 71 such positive trigrams and 5 such negative trigrams learned from the AMI data.",

        "Conditional probabilities are calculated by comparing pattern occurrences in the relevant text with occurrences in all text, and we again use a threshold of p >= 0.65 and frequency >= 5 for significant patterns.",
        "For the BLOG06 data, we use a probability cutoff of 0.75 as before.",
        "For deriving the features used in our machine learning experiments, the patterns are similarly grouped according to conditional probability.",

        "For the purpose of these experiments, we consider a sentence to be subjective if at least two of the annotators labeled it as subjective, and similarly consider a subjective sentence to be positive or negative if at least two annotators label it as such.",
        "Using this majority vote labeling, 172 of 1800 sentences are considered subjective, with 44% of those labeled as positive-subjective and 37% as negative-subjective, showing that there is much more of a balance between positive and negative sentiment in these email threads compared with meeting speech (note that some subjective sentences are not positive or negative).",
        "The n for labeling subjective sentences in the email corpus is 0.32.",
        "The lower annotator agreement on emails compared with meetings suggests that subjectivity in email text may be manifested more subtly or conveyed somewhat amibiguously.",
        "For these experiments we use a maximum entropy classifier using the liblinear toolkit (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "Feature subset selection is carried out by calculating the F-statistic for each feature, ranking the features according to the statistic, and training on increasingly smaller subsets of feature in a cross-validation procedure, ultimately choosing the feature set with the highest balanced accuracy during cross-validation.",
        "Because the annotated portions of our corpora are fairly small (20 meetings, 40 email threads), we employ a leave-one-out method for training and testing rather than using dedicated training and test sets.",
        "For the polarity labeling task applied to the BC3 corpus, we pool all of the sentences and perform 10-fold cross-validation at the sentence level.",
        "We employ two sets of metrics for evaluating all classifiers: precision/recall/f-measure and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.",
        "The ROC curve plots the true-positive/false-positive ratio while the posterior threshold is varied, and we report the area under the curve (AUROC) as the measure of interest.",
        "Random performance would feature an AUROC of approximately 0.5, while perfect classification would yield an AUROC of 1.",
        "The advantage of the AUROC score compared with precision/recall/f-measure is that it evaluates a given classifier across all thresholds, indicating the classifier's overall discriminating power.",
        "This metric is also known to be appropriate when class distributions are skewed (Fawcett, 2003), as is our case.",
        "For completeness we report both AUROC and p/r/f, but our discussions focus primarily on the AUROC comparisons."
