        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) depends on the amount of bilingual data and its quality.",
        "In real-world SMT systems, bilingual data is often mined from the web where low-quality data is inevitable.",
        "The low-quality bilingual data degrades the quality of word alignment and leads to the incorrect phrase pairs, which will hurt the translation performance of phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "Therefore, it is very important to exploit data quality information to improve the translation modeling.",
        "Previous work on bilingual data cleaning often involves some supervised learning methods.",
        "Several bilingual data mining systems (Resnik and ?This work has been done while the first author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "Smith, 2003; Shi et al., 2006; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Jiang et al., 2009) have a post-processing step for data cleaning.",
        "Maximum entropy or SVM based classifiers are built to filter some non-parallel data or partial-parallel data.",
        "Although these methods can filter some low-quality bilingual data, they need sufficient human labeled training instances to build the model, which may not be easy to acquire.",
        "To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to clean the bilingual data.",
        "It is intuitive that high-quality parallel data tends to produce better phrase pairs than low-quality data.",
        "Meanwhile, it is also observed that the phrase pairs that appear frequently in the bilingual corpus are more reliable than less frequent ones because they are more reusable, hence most good sentence pairs are prone to contain more frequent phrase pairs (Foster et al., 2006; Wuebker et al., 2010).",
        "This kind of mutual reinforcement fits well into the framework of graph-based random walk.",
        "When a phrase pair p is extracted from a sentence pair s, s is considered casting a vote for p. The higher the number of votes a phrase pair has, the more reliable of the phrase pair.",
        "Similarly, the quality of the sentence pair s is determined by the number of votes casted by the extracted phrase pairs from s. In this paper, a PageRank-style random walk algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea and Ta-rau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007) is conducted to iteratively compute the importance score of each sentence pair that indicates its quality: the higher the better.",
        "Unlike other data filtering methods, our proposed method utilizes the importance scores of sentence pairs as fractional counts to calculate the phrase translation probabilities based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), thereby none of the bilingual data is filtered out.",
        "Experimental results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the performance in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks."
