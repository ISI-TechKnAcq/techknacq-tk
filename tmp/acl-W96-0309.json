        "The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguistic semantics (Bergsten 1911, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1970, Lees 1970, Downing 1977, Levi 1978, Warren 1987), and their analysis has presented a serious challenge for natural language processing systems (Finin 1980, McDonald 1982, Isabelle 1984, Alshawi 1987, Hobbs et al. 1993, Bouillon et al. 1992, Jones 1995, Johnston, Boguraev, and Pustejovsky 1995).",
        "In this paper, we argue that composition in compound constructions involves specification of the arguments of predicate structures within the qualia structure of the head noun.",
        "In essence, the qualia structure provides the 'glue' which links together the semantic contributions of modifying nouns and the head noun in the compound.",
        "This approach has significant advantages over approaches which introduce abstract relations to describe the form of modification involved (Levi 1978, Jones 1995), in that it assimilates the composition of complex nominals to other compositional processes of natural language.",
        "The predicates in the qualia are not there just to account for compounds but also to account for a wide variety of forms of composition and interpretation including argument selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).",
        "In order to account for the availability of compounds and other complex nominals we utilize phrase structure schemata which capture the different ways in which head nouns and modifying nouns can compose.",

        "The final noun is the head and the others are modifiers.",
        "Italian, on the other hand, generally avoids compounds.",
        "Most of the compounds that are possible involve an underived verb (e.g. portadocumenti (document holder), segnalibro (bookmark), spaventapasseri (scarecrow), etc.",

        "In (1c) and (1d), the modifier relates to the origin of the object described by the head noun, how it was brought about.",
        "A bullet hole is a hole which was brought about by the passage of a bullet, and lemon juice is juice that is brought about by squeezing a lemon.",
        "For forms in which the modifier specifies some aspect of the origin of the head, the appropriate preposition for the Italian form appears to be di.",

        "For forms in which the modifier specifies the constitution of the head, the appropriate preposition in Italian is a.",
        "In English, the form of the semantic relation that holds between the modifying noun and the",
        "head noun is unspecified and left implicit, while in the corresponding Italian complex nominals, it is partially specified by the preposition which introduces the modifying noun.",
        "This difference between English and Italian is representative of a more general difference in structure between Germanic languages and Romance languages.",
        "Complex nominal expressions in Germanic languages frequently involve compounding while complex nominals in Romance languages use post-modifying prepositional phrases.",
        "One motivation for examination of parallel data from English and Italian is that it can reveal the otherwise implicit relation between the elements of an English compound.",
        "This difference in the internal structure of nominals has important consequences for multilingual language processing.",
        "For example, in order to translate English complex nominals into Italian you need to determine the nature of the semantic relation in the compound in order to determine the preposition to use in the Italian form.",

        "The analysis of complex nominal constructions presented in this paper has a range of important applications in natural language processing.",
        "Complex nominals play an important role in the encapsulation and expression of nominal concepts and are frequent in a wide variety of types of texts.",
        "Therefore, the ability to handle complex nominals is essential for parsing and generation systems for either English or Italian.",
        "It is important to note that systems utilizing compositional apparatus for the analysis of complex nominals need not treat all compounds compositionally.",
        "The optimal arrangement will be to list frequent and idiosyncratic compound forms in the lexicon and use the compositional apparatus for forms which are not listed, or in instances when the listed interpretation is ruled out by context.",
        "We would also like to point out that we do not expect to develop an analysis which will handle all and every compound form.",
        "Our target is to have an account which will handle the majority of productive compounding patterns.",
        "Another important use of the compositional apparatus described here is in lexical acquisition of compound forms.",
        "This machinery can be used to indicate potential interpretations for compounds.",
        "A human editor can then select the appropriate interpretation from the candidate set and add have the compound added to the lexicon.",
        "Given the range of different semantic relations that can hold between the elements of a complex nominal, they are frequently ambiguous.",
        "English compounds are worse than Italian post-modified forms in this respect, since in Italian the preposition gives at least some indication of the relation involved.",
        "The approach described in this paper constrains the interpretation of complex nominals using the type system.",
        "For example, the schema in (6), which accounts for bread knife, requires the modifying noun to be typed as individual.",
        "This limits the set of potential modifiers to those typed as individual.",
        "Since the content of the modifier is structure-shared with an argument position",
        "within the TELIC, this set of potential modifiers is further constrained by type constraints imposed by the relation in the TELIC role.",
        "The cut_act will require the object cut to be a separable object.",
        "It could potentially require the cutter to be significantly harder than the object to be cut.",
        "Type constraints of this kind serve to greatly reduce the degree of ambiguity in a given complex nominal, but it will still generally be the case that more than one interpretation is predicted for a given form.",
        "For example, a form like bone knife could be interpreted either as a knife used for cutting bone or a knife made of bone.",
        "The approach described here needs to be integrated with further mechanisms and heuristics in order to determine the best guess for complex nominal interpretation in any given case.",
        "One important class of mechanisms are those which examine the current sentential and discourse context in order to restrict the range of interpretations.",
        "For example, if bone knife appears in a medical text, bone most probably specifies the object to be cut by the knife, while if it shows up in a text concerning prehistoric man, bone most probably refers to the constitution of the knife.",
        "One way in which compounds can be further disambiguated is through the incorporation of a statistical model as one of the heuristics employed in determining the appropriate interpretation.",
        "In such an approach, one could train on a data set comprised of compounds paired with an indication of the relation holding between the head and the modifier.",
        "The resulting model would provide the probability that a given complex nominal involves a particular kind of modification relation.",
        "In order to have useful predictive power, it would be best to assign semantic types to the elements of the complex nominal and determine the probability that a complex nominal consisting of words of types A and B involves modification relation C. Given the sparsity of data to support a statistically based approach we believe that the way forward in this area is to pursue the integration of a rule-based approach with a statistical model.",
        "Such integration has already proven effective in the treatment of sense extension phenomena (Copestake and Briscoe 1995).",
        "We leave further investigation of this integration for future work.",
        "This work also has important consequences for applications in multilingual natural language processing.",
        "The most obvious of these is the use of a cross-linguistic approach to complex nominals in machine translation.",
        "Translation of complex nominals from Italian to English will be more straightforward, since there is a loss of information rather than a gain.",
        "It is important to note, however, that not all Italian complex nominals involving post-modification can be translated as noun-noun compounds in English.",
        "For example, forms such as coltello da macellaio (literally, knife of butcher), in which the modifier is an agent using the object described by the head, does not translate as butcher knife.",
        "In English, the appropriate nominal construction in this case uses the possessive: butcher's knife.",
        "Translation from English to Italian is substantially more difficult given the difference in explicitness regarding the semantic relation between the head and modifier.",
        "In order to generate the proper output in Italian, it is necessary to determine the relation between the elements in the English compound structure and to determine the appropriate preposition in Italian for expression of that relation.",
        "One approach to this task is to use the GL representation language essentially as an interlingua (McDonald 1995).",
        "The phrase structure schemata for English are used in order to determine potential interpretations for a given English compound construction.",
        "The most likely interpretation from the candidate set is picked on the basis of contextual and statistical models.",
        "The CONTENT of the chosen candidate is then matched against the outputs of the various phrase structure schemata used for Italian.",
        "When an appropriate schema is identified it is instantiated with lexical items from the Italian lexicon in order to generate the Italian translation.",
        "An important feature of this approach is that it utilizes resources which are independently needed for analysis of the languages involved.",
        "Aside from translation, the phrase structure schemata can also be used for multilingual generation.",
        "If a particular concept is encoded in the GL lexical representation language, the language-specific phrase structure schemata can be employed to generate the",
        "corresponding complex nominal in each language.",
        "In addition to the importance of successful translation of complex nominals for full-text machine translation, this functionality is useful in itself for applications in multilingual information retrieval and information extraction.",
        "Since complex nominals are so frequently used to coin terms which encapsulate important distinguished concepts within a domain, their successful identification and processing is an essential element of determination of the topic of a text and they provide important hooks for information retrieval.",
        "In a multilingual setting, such as information retrieval over the World Wide Web, it may be desirable for a search for a complex nominal from one language to yield documents regarding the same concept in other languages.",

        "In Italian, the canonical prepositions for these three kinds of modification are da, di, and a, respectively.",
        "In compounds where the modifying noun denotes an event, the composition in the compound frequently involves co-composition between the qualia structure of the head and modifier.",
        "In Italian, for TELIC modification the preposition is da when the modifier describes an activity and di when the modifier describes a result.",
        "In addition to its theoretical relevance, the approach to the semantics of complex nominals described here has important applications in the construction of natural language processing systems.",
        "In particular, it provides the foundations for machine translation of complex nominals between English and Italian and can be readily applied in multilingual generation and multilingual information extraction."
