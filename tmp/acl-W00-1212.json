        "Substantial efforts have been made to parse western languages such as English, and many powerful computational models have been proposed (Gazdar, et al., 1987, Tomita, M, 1986).",
        "However, very limited work has been done with Chinese.",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that the structure of the Chinese language is quite different from English.",
        "Therefore the computational model in processing English may not be directly applied to the Chinese language.",
        "Lin-Shan Lee et al. (1991) proposed a Chinese natural language processing system with special consideration of some typical phenomena of Chinese.",
        "Jinye Thou et al. (1986) presented a deterministic Chinese parsing methodology using formal semantics to combine syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "However, most of the proposed approaches were realized on small-scale lexicon and rule base (usually thousands words and tens or hundreds rules).",
        "It is still an open issue whether these models will work on real texts containing various ungrammatical phenomena.",
        "A parser capable of handling real text should have not only large lexicon and big rule base, but also high robustness in coping with different kinds of ungrammatical phenomena.",
        "Therefore, it is important to design a grammar scheme which not only is capable of representing the unique grammar structures which are different with English, but also qualified of handling unrestricted text.",
        "Phrase structure scheme is usually used in English parsing models to represent sentence structures, but it is not convenient and not strong enough to express Chinese sentence by phrase structure in some occasions.",
        "For examples:",
        "Sentence-1 is a pivot sentence(*iÂ§), i.e., \"M,\" is not only the object of \"4\" but also the subject of \" U\" .",
        "But this phrase structure cannot indicate the relations clearly as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "However, the grammar structure is clarified if it is represented in dependency structure (Fig.",
        "2).",
        "Therefore, it is believed that dependency grammar scheme is more suitable than phrase structure to represent Chinese structures (Thou, Huang, 1994).",
        "However, traditional Dependency grammar realizes the dependency relations between any of two specific words, then numerous word based dependency knowledge should be constructed, this is a time-consuming task.",
        "Fortunately, knowledge for phrase structure parsing has been accumulated for Chinese for many years and it should be reused to compensate the lack of knowledge of word-based dependency parsing.",
        "Therefore, to combine the advantages of phrase structure parsing and dependency parsing, we propose a new parsing strategy, called \"block-based dependency parsing\".",
        "A \"block\" means a basic component of sentence, for example, there are six blocks for sentence 1:",
        "A block represents an information unit in communications.",
        "For example, in Chinese-Japanese machine translation, translations of the members within a block in a Chinese sentence usually are in a same blocks in the Japanese translation.",
        "Furthermore, it is clear to represent block with phrase structure, while it is rather complicated with dependency structure.",
        "This block-based dependency parsing process works like follows.",
        "For an input sentence, basic components of sentence, i.e., \"blocks\" are first identified by an ATN-like partial parsing procedure, which produces a clear skeleton of the sentence structure.",
        "In our phrase structure analysis, we don't try to deduce the whole sentence into root S, instead, we only try to get the components, namely blocks.",
        "This partial parsing strategy guarantees high robustness.",
        "Then dependency parsing is applied in order to build dependency relations among blocks.",
        "The dependency parsing skips ungrammatical portions it encounters.",
        "This strategy confines ungrammatical portion and avoids errors to be propagated globally.",
        "By partial parsing and skip strategy, this parser can handle long, complicated, or even faulty sentences.",
        "The experiments show that this parser is very robust and powerful.",
        "A parser constructed based on this approach has been developed, with 220,000 words, 5,000 part-of-speech tagging rules, over 1,000 block parsing rules and 300 dependency parsing rules.",
        "This parser has been applied in a Chinese-Japanese machine translation product (Zhou, 1999).",
        "To the author's knowledge, this parser is one of the largest scale Chinese parser ever implemented in the world.",
        "The outline of this paper is as follows.",
        "In section 1, we present our special solution to part-of-speech tagging which significantly affects the Chinese parsing.",
        "Section 2 describes in details the block-based dependency parsing approach.",
        "We then explain the dependency parsing algorithm in section 3.",
        "The experiment and its analysis are given in section 4.",
        "The conclusion is given in section 5."

        "Therefore the conflict of rules becomes very serious.",
        "It means that part-of-speech information in Chinese is too weak to support Chinese syntactical analysis.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose that in the part-of-speech tagging stage, the real grammar features of this kind of words are determined directly as N, instead of V. To do this, we describe all possible word category information for a word in the lexicon, for example:",

        "Then frame structures (DP), which have paired starting word and ending word , such as \" \"-- .",
        "\" \" \" \" etc are identified, but its internal structure analysis is delayed.",

        "Then ATN network will use again to identify the complicated blocks, called level-2 blocks, which may contain LP, DP, IP as its components.",
        "Then a sequence of blocks obtained is then transported to dependency parser, which will generate dependency relations among blocks.",
        "After that, we will recursively parse the internal parts of IP,",
        "Except PP, LP and DP, each kind of block is defined by a set of rules in the form of phrase structure rule.",
        "All of these rules combined with syntactic and semantic constraints are implemented as an ATN network (Allen, 1995).",
        "We also define 17 kinds of dependency relations for Chinese as shown in table 2.",
        "1) Identification DP by matching the starting word and ending word; 2) Identification of meta-blocks by bottom-up analysis; 3) Identification of NP, UP, UG, NTL, NTP, AP, FP, VP of level 1 by bottom-up analysis; 4) Identification LP, PP by looking for left boundary for LP and right boundary for IP, by using a set of Chinese linguistic rules; 5) Identification of NP, UP, UG, NTL, NTP, AP, FP, VP of level 2 by bottom-up analysis; 6) Dependency parsing with the blocks identified; 7) For blocks LP, DP and LP, recursively do 1 thorough 6.",
