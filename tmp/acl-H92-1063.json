        "The PLUM (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) natural language understanding system for extracting data from text is based on three unusual features: probabilistic language models, a domain-independent deterministic parser, and processing of (the resulting) fragments at the semantic and discourse level.",
        "Earlier papers have focused on the probabilistic aspects of the system [Weischedel et al., 1991; de Marcken, 1990]; here we focus on the other two design features.",
        "While several deterministic parsers have been constructed based on Marcus's Determinism Hypothesis, PLUM seems to be the first application system that employs a deterministic parser.",
        "Many systems have been built based on semantic and discourse-level processing of fragments, most notably systems based on conceptual dependency and scripts [Schank and Riesbeck, 1981].",
        "However, PLUM may be the first system that uses a hybrid of such semantic techniques with the purely syntactic processing of Marcus's Determinism Hypothesis, two approaches that seemed totally antithetical when first proposed.",
        "The impact of marrying those two techniques is a robust system that produces answers in the application domain in spite of syntactic complexity, syntactic ill-formedness, extra-grammaticality and a high percentage of unknown words.",
        "A second impact is that the system can produce answers at a very early stage of porting it to a new domain.",
        "Both of these claims are substantiated in this paper by evaluating the performance of the system as the lexicon grows, without changing the syntactic, semantic, and discourse rules of the system."

        "change and improve substantially during the next two years of research and development.",
        "A preprocessor driven by finite state rules divides the message into header material (if any), paragraphs, sentences, and trailer material (if any).",
        "A well-known problem in using deterministic parsing is the fact that most words in English are ambiguous even regarding part of speech.",
        "In the Foreign Broadcast Information Service texts of MUC-3, we estimate that the vocabulary had an average ambiguity of over two parts of speech in the TREEBANK tag system.",
        "In PLUM, determining the part of speech of highly ambiguous words is performed by well-known Markov modelling techniques.",
        "Though part of speech ambiguity was high, the only ambiguity that negatively impacted performance in extracting the desired information from text was recognizing proper nouns, since the text is upper case only, and the set of names is open-ended, as is the general vocabulary.",
        "To improve the recognition of Latin American names, we employed a statistically derived five-gram (five letter) model of words of Spanish origin and a similar five-gram model of English words, under the assumption that",
        "words of Spanish origin in these English texts about Latin America were probably proper names.",
        "The parser and grammar are designed to find analyses for a non-overlapping sequence of fragments, as represented by the multiple fragments in Figure 1.",
        "When cases of permanent, predictable ambiguity arise, such as a prepositional phrase that can be attached in multiple ways, most conjoined phrases, commas, and parentheses, the parser closes the analysis of the current fragment (including all open constituents), and begins the analysis of a new fragment.",
        "This is a departure from Marcus's D-Theory proposal, where an ancestor relationship for each constituent must be stated even if a parent relationship cannot be.",
        "Thus, in the example below, but and no injuries are analyzed, but not placed under any node.",
        "The departure does not seem to hurt semantic processing, since the critical entities in the text and some relations between them are found in every sentence, whether syntactically ill-formed, complex, novel, or straightforward.",
        "Rather, the impact was beneficial, for we were able to produce output of the whole system much earlier than if the grammar rules, semantic rules, and lexicon had to be more complete.",
        "Unlike the previous systems based on conceptual dependency and script application [Schank and Riesbeck, 1981], this parsing is done using domain-independent syntactic rules.",
        "The deterministic parser employed was developed by de Marcken at MIT [de Marcken 1990].",
        "Though we have not (yet) made substantial changes to the parsing code nor to the grammar, we are replacing his \"disambiguator\", which deals with part-of-speech ambiguity with our stochastic part-of-speech tagger (POST) [Meteer, et al.",

        "Semantic analysis is shallow; for example, in Figure 2 the pp-modifier slot of the entity corresponding to the embassies of the PRC is not semantically analyzed further by the semantic interpreter, e.g., to determine whether the PRC owns the embassy buildings, whether the PRC uses the embassy buildings, etc.",
        "Shallow analysis is necessary since most of the words in an article are semantically unknown, and since it is highly desirable that some analysis be produced for each fragment to avoid totally missing information.",
        "(Jacobs et al.",
        "[1991] estimate that 75% of the words in these MUC texts are not relevant.)",

        "Domain-dependent, lexical semantic rules contain traditional case frame information, e.g., the logical object of a murder is a living thing.",
        "The novel aspect in PLUM is that the case frames for verbs were hypothesized by a statistical induction algorithm [Weischedel, et al., 1991a].",
        "Each hypothesized case frame was manually reviewed over a two day period, rather than the weeks or even months of effort that might normally be involved in writing case frames for verbs.",
        "The frame-based semantic representation for an unusually short and simple sentence appears in Figure 2.",
        "Based on local syntactic and semantic information, a fragment combining algorithm combines phrases to provide more complete analyses of the input [Weischedel, et al., 1991a].",
        "The current set of fragment combining rules focus on finding conjoined phrases,1 prepositional phrase attachment2, appositive recognition, and on correcting some errors made by the parser (e.g., combining adjacent fragments into a single noun phrase).",
        "Though there was no time to integrate and test this component for use MUC-3 in May, 1991, an experiment on the improvement in syntactic analyses produced based on this component is included in this paper.",
        "Our fragment combining code is rule-based, and can take into account syntactic categories, simple properties of the tree configuration (for example, whether a node is the only child of its parent), and semantic type.",
        "The simplest attachment strategy is to process the fragments of a sentence from left to right, considering each pair of successive fragments.",
        "For each pair of fragments, all possible attachment points on the right edge of the left fragment are considered, starting from the lowest (closest) node.",
        "Some rules consider more than one fragment to the right, for example, combining an NP with commas on each side into a single appositive NP.",
        "Therefore, as in the deterministic parser, decisions are made locally, rather than assuming global context.",
        "1 The parser usually produces fragments where a conjoined phrase appears because local syntactic information is typically not sufficient to reliably predict the correct parse.",
        "2 The parser usually does not attach prepositional phrases because of the inherent ambiguity.",
        "The discourse discourse component performs three tasks: hypothesizing relevant events from diverse descriptions, recognizing co-reference, and hypothesizing values for components of an event.",
        "Discourse processing would normally look for entities to fill roles in stated predicates, as Hobbs [1989, 1988] has argued.",
        "Since complete syntactic accounts of a sentence are not usually found by our system,3 semantic representations of events and states of affairs have more unfilled slots (roles) than if complete syntactic analyses were found.",
        "In our case, there are simply more such unfilled roles, and less syntactic relations helping out.",
        "A second challenge faced by the discourse component is that reference resolution must be performed with limited semantic understanding.",
        "Given these challenges, it is clear from the test results in MUC-3 that the discourse component does reconstruct event structure well, in spite of missing syntactic and semantic relations.",
        "An example frame for an event produced by discourse processing appears in Figure 3.",
        "A score of 0 indicates the filler was found directly by the semantics; a score of 1 indicates it was in the same fragment; 2 indicates it was in the same sentence; 4 indicates it was found in the same paragraph; and 6 that it was found in an adjacent paragraph.",

        "These were key to PLUM performing among the top systems evaluated in MUC-3.",
        "Because of the focus on producing syntactic and semantic analyses of fragments when no complete analysis was possible, and because of the assumption that discourse processing can fit the fragments together based on required roles in defmed event structures, the system can produce answers end-to-end very early on when porting to a new domain, long before domain-specific lexical items and any domain-specific semantic rules are complete.",
        "That conclusion is supported quantitatively by our experiments.",
        "Recall, the percent of information in the text correctly extracted, grew nearly linearly as the lexicon grew in the experiment.",
        "Precision, the percent correct information extracted of information output by PLUM, remained flat as a function of lexicon size, also supporting the intuition that the lexicon was declarative and separate from rule-based processing.",
        "A second conclusion is that deterministic parsing can be supplemented by locally applied, fragment combining rules that use both the syntactic and semantic properties of fragments produced to resolve ambiguity that syntax alone can not resolve in a deterministic parser.",
        "The experiment reported here demonstrates that.",
        "The degree of success obtained by marrying domain-independent, deterministic parsing with partial understanding and statistical techniques has been quite gratifying.",
        "The techniques which seemed so incompatible and antithetical in the seventies have proven synergistic."
