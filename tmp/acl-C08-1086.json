        "2006), and recommender systems (Sharda-nand and Maes 1995; Resnick and Varian 1997).",
        "Consider the lexical semantics task of explaining why a set of terms are similar: given a set of terms and a large set of possible explanations for their similarity, one must choose only the best n explanations to display to a user.",
        "There are many ways to explain why terms are similar; one way is to list the semantic properties that are shared by the terms.",
        "For example, consider the following set of terms corresponding to fruit names:",
        "Example semantic properties that could be used to explain their similarity include: they are products, they can be eaten, they are solid (but not they are companies, for example).",
        "The list of such semantic properties can be very large and some are much more informative than others.",
        "For example, the property can-be-eaten is much more informative of the similarity of {apple, ume, pawpaw, quince} than the property is-solid.",
        "Using a simple measure of association between properties and queries, explained in detail later in this paper, one can rank each property and obtain the following three highest scoring properties for explaining the similarity of these terms:",
        "{they are products, they can be imported, they can be exported}",
        "Even though can be imported and can be exported are highly ranked explanations, taken jointly, once we know one the other does not offer much more information since most things that can be imported can also be exported.",
        "In other words, there is a large overlap in information between the two properties.",
        "A more informative set of explanations could be obtained by replacing one of these two properties with a property that scored lower but had less information overlap with the others, for example:",
        "Even though, taken alone, the property can be eaten may not be as informative as can be exported, it does indeed add more information to the explanation set when considered jointly with the other explanations.",
        "In this paper, we propose an information theoretic objective function for modeling the joint information in an n-best list.",
        "Derived using conditional self-information, we measure the amount of information that each property contributes to a query.",
        "Intuitively, when adding a new property to a result set, we should prefer a property that contributes the maximum amount of information to the existing set.",

        "There are a vast number of applications of ranking and its importance to the commercial success at companies such as Google and Yahoo have fueled a great deal of research in recent years.",
        "In this paper, we investigate one particular aspect of ranking, the importance of considering the results in an n-best list jointly because of the information overlap issues described in the introduction, and one particular application, namely explaining why a set of terms are similar.",
        "Considering results jointly is not a new idea and is very similar to the concept of diversity-based ranking introduced in the IR community by Carbonell and Goldstein (1998).",
        "In short, selecting an n-best list is a balancing act between maximizing the relevance of the list and the information novelty of its results.",
        "One commonly used approach is to define a measure of novelty/semantic similarity between documents and to apply heuristics to reduce the relevance score of a result item (a hit) by a function of the similarity of this item to other results in the list (Carbonell common approach is to cluster result documents according to their semantic similarity and present clusters to users instead of individual documents (Hearst and Pedersen 1996; Leuski 2001; Liu and Croft 2004).",
        "In this paper, we argue that the balance between relevance and novelty can be captured by a formal model that maximizes the joint information content of a result set.",
        "Instead of ranking documents in an IR setting, we focus in this paper on a new task of selecting the best semantic properties that describe the similarity of a set of query terms.",
        "By no means an exhaustive list, the most commonly cited ranking and scoring algorithms are HITS (Kleinberg 1998) and PageRank (Page et al.",
        "1998), which rank hyperlinked documents using the concepts of hubs and authorities.",
        "The most well-known keyword scoring methods within the IR community are the tf-idf (Salton and McGill 1983) and pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks 1989) measures, which put more importance on matching keywords that occur frequently in a document relative to the total number of documents that contain the keyword (by normalizing term frequencies with inverse document frequencies).",
        "Various methods including tf-idf have been comparatively evaluated by Salton and Buckley (1987).",
        "Creating n-best lists using the above algorithms produce result sets where each result is considered independently.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the utility of considering the result sets jointly and compare our joint method to a pointwise mutual information model.",
        "Within the NLP community, n-best list ranking has been looked at carefully in parsing, extractive summarization (Barzilay et al.",
        "1999; Hovy and Lin 1998), and machine translation (Zhang et al.",
        "2006), to name a few.",
        "The problem of learning to rank a set of objects by combining a given collection of ranking functions using boosting techniques is investigated in (Freund et al.",
        "2003).",
        "This rank boosting technique has been used in re-ranking parsers (Collins and Koo 2000; Charniak and Johnson 2005).",
        "Such re-ranking approaches usually improve the likelihood of candidate results using extraneous features and, for example in parsing, the properties of the trees.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a difference task: the lexical semantics task of selecting the best semantic properties that help explain why a set of query terms are similar.",

        "{they are products, they can be imported, they can be exported}",

        "Looking at commercial applications, there are many examples showcasing the importance of ranking, for example Internet search engines like Google and Yahoo (Brin and Page 1998).",
        "Another application is online recommendation systems where suggestions must be ranked before being presented to a user (Shardanand and Maes 1995).",

        "That is, given a set of terms, one must choose the best set of characterizations of why the terms are similar, chosen from a large set of possible explanations.",
        "Analyzing the different ways in which one can explain/characterize the similarity between terms is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The types of explanations that we consider in this paper are semantic properties that are shared by the terms.",

        "In Section 4, we describe two models for measuring this uncertainty reduction and in Section 5.1, we describe an evaluation methodology for quantifying this reduction in uncertainty using human judgments.",
        "What is the source of the semantic properties to be used as explanations?",

        "Unfortunately, many grammatical relations do not specify semantic properties, such as most conjunction relations for example.",
        "In this paper, we use a combination of corpus statistics and manual filters of grammatical relations (such as omitting conjunction relations) to uncover candidate semantic properties, as described in the next section.",
        "With this method, we unfortunately uncover some non-semantic properties and fail to uncover some correct semantic properties.",
        "Improving the candidate lists of semantic properties is grounds for further investigation.",

        "This paper investigates the problem of n-best ranking on the lexical semantics task of explaining/characterizing the similarity of a group of terms where only a small set of many possible semantic properties may be displayed to a user.",
        "We propose that considering the results jointly, by accounting for the information overlap between results, helps generate better n-best lists.",
        "We presented an information theoretic objective function, called Joint Information Ranking, for modeling the joint information in an n-best list.",
        "On our lexical semantics task, empirical evidence shows that humans significantly prefer JIR n-best lists over a baseline model that considers the explanations independently.",
        "Our results show that the n-best lists generated by the joint model are judged to be significantly different from those generated by the independent model 50.0% ± 3.1% of the time, out of which they are preferred 76.6% ± 5.2% of the time, with 95% confidence.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate other joint models using latent semantic analysis techniques, and to investigate heuristic algorithms to both optimize search efficiency and to better approximate our JIR objective function.",
        "Although applied only to the task of characterizing the similarity of terms, it is our hope that the JIR model will generalize well to many ranking tasks, from keyword search ranking, to recommendation systems, to advertisement placements."
