        "Thirty-eight years ago, in the summer of 1969 at the second meeting of COLING in Sanga-Saby in Sweden, I stood for the first time in front of a computational audience and started my talk on Discourse Referents by reading the following passage (Karttunen 1976):",
        "Consider a device designed to read a text in some natural language, interpret it, and store the content in some manner, say, for the purpose of being able to answer questions about it.",
        "To accomplish this task, the machine will have to fulfill at least the following basic requirement.",
        "It has to be able to build a file that consists of records of all individuals, that is, events, objects, etc., mentioned in the text and, for each individual, record whatever is said about it.",
        "Of course, for the time being at least, it seems that such a text interpreter is not a practical idea, but this should not discourage us from studying in the abstract what kind of capabilities the machine would have to possess, provided that our study provides us with some insight into natural language in general.",
        "The paper went on to discuss the circumstances that allow a pronoun or a definite description to refer to an object introduced by an indefinite noun phrase.",
        "For example, in (1a), the pronoun It can refer to Bill's car, but in (1b) it cannot.",

        "A year later in 1970, I gave my first ACL presentation at the 8th annual meeting in Columbus, Ohio.",
        "The title of the invited talk was The Logic ofEnglish Predicate Complement Constructions.",
        "It started off with the following declaration (Karttunen 1971b):",
        "It is evident that logical relations between main sentences and their complements are of great significance in any system of automatic data processing that depends on natural language.",
        "For this reason a systematic study of such relations, of which this paper is an example, will certainly have a great practical value, in addition to what it may contribute to the theory of the semantics of natural languages.",
        "The paper presented a classification of verbs and constructions that take sentential complements, that-clauses and infinitival complements, based on whether the sentence commits the author to the truth or falsity of the complement clause.",
        "For example, all the sentences in (2) imply, for different reasons, that the complement is true while all the sentences in (3) imply that the complement is false.",

        "Ed did not leave.",
        "Neither one of these two papers would have been accepted at this 2007 ACL conference.",
        "There was no implementation, no evaluation, and very little discussion of related work.",
        "In the happy childhood of computational linguistics even the most junior person in the field, like myself, was allowed – even invited – to give a talk at the main COLING/ACL session about uncharted linguistic phenomena.",
        "It was a small field then.",
        "A future historian of the field might be puzzled by the 1969 and 1970 papers.",
        "They were written by a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, who had arrived from Finland in 1964 by way of the University of Indiana at Bloomington where he had just received a Ph.D. in Linguistics.",
        "Where did the young man acquire, and why was he spouting, that kind of computational rhetoric, when the record shows that for the next ten years he never laid his hands on a computer?",
        "The fact is that I did have a brush with computational linguistics before settling down to do pure semantics in the 1970s.",
        "I wanted to do linguistics because of Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957) and when the Uralic and Altaic Studies Department in Bloomington offered me a job in 1964 as a \"native informant\" in Finnish I accepted and managed to get into the Linguistics department as a graduate student.",
        "My job title turned out not to be accurate.",
        "During my first two years in Bloomington I was teaching Finnish on my own for nine hours per week.",
        "Luckily, I signed up for a course on computational linguistics taught by an excellent teacher and mentor, Robert E. Wall.",
        "Bob Wall had participated in an early MT project at Harvard and in a project on automatic",
        "1 The subscripts i and j are referential indices.",
        "Two noun phrases with the same referential index are supposed to be coreferential, that is, they should refer to the same object.",
        "2 I am using the word imply as a generic cover term for entail, presupppose,and conventionally implicate.",
        "More about this in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.",
        "summarization at IBM.",
        "In his course, we learned formal language theory from notes that eventually became a book (Wall 1972), a bit of Fortran and COMIT, a language developed by Victor Yngve at MIT.",
        "I wrote a program on punched cards to randomly generate sentences from a small grammar of Finnish.",
        "Thanks to Bob, I was rescued from my indentured servitude in the Uralic and Altaic Studies.",
        "In my third and final year in Bloomington, I worked as a research assistant in the Computer Center with no specific duties other than to be a liaison to the Linguistics Department.",
        "My only accomplishment in that role was to save piles of anthropological data from obsolescence by writing a program to transform rolls of 5-channel paper tape to 6-channel magnetic tapes.",
        "By doing that, I became one of the few linguists who could explain the joke, There are 10 kinds of linguists: those who know binary and those who don't.",
        "I suspect that the data on my tapes for the Control Data 3600 computer have now been lost.",
        "We still have the data on manuscripts hundreds of years old but much of the content created in the first decades of the computer age is gone forever.",
        "Just as I was starting to work on my dissertation in 1967, I had the good fortune of getting a one-year fellowship at the RAND corporation in Santa Monica, California, in the group headed by David G. Hays, the author of the first textbook in our field (Hays 1967), and the founder of the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL, the predecessor of our ACL).",
        "The main focus of Hays's team was Russian-to-English machine translation.",
        "Remarkably, Hays was also one of the authors of the infamous 1966 ALPAC report that inexorably caused the shutdown of all governmentally funded MT projects, including the one at RAND.",
        "Because the term machine translation had acquired a bad odor, the 1968 meeting of AMTCL dropped MT from its name and became ACL.",
        "At the 1970 meeting, the first one that I attended, people were still bitterly arguing about the matter.",
        "In Hays's group at RAND I again met Martin Kay, who had been my teacher in a course on parsing at the 1966 Linguistic Institute at UCLA.",
        "My term paper for Martin's course had been on the computational analysis of Finnish morphology, a topic to which I would eventually return some fifteen years later.",
        "Happy to become Martin's student again, I learned Algol, an elegant new programming language, and got an understanding of the beauty of recursive algorithms.",
        "Martin was running an exciting weekly colloquium series.",
        "I teamed up with an intern by the name of Ronald Kaplan for a small study project and we gave a joint presentation about our findings.",
        "Ron and I agree that we did this together but neither one remembers what we said.",
        "It probably was about the similarities and differences between pronouns and logical variables, the topic of my first published paper (Karttunen 1969b).",
        "At the time the prevailing assumption was that symbolic logic provides an appropriate system for semantic representation within transformational grammar (McCawley 1970).",
        "But as I showed in the 1969 CSL paper, even cases as simple as (4a) and (4b) could not be treated adequately within the proposed framework.",
        "(4) a.",
        "The mani who loved hisi wife,- kissed her,.",
        "b. I gave each student a cookiei.",
        "Some of them ate iti right away.",
        "c. The pilot, who shot at it, hit the Mig, that chased himi.",
        "The problem with (4a) is that the phrase hisi wife has to be treated in situ as it cannot be replaced by another coreferential noun phrase, say Mary, without changing the meaning.",
        "(4a) implies that only one man in some group of men loved his wife, which is not the same as there being just one man who loved Mary even if the two noun phrases pick out the same individual.",
        "For this reason there was no way in a system such as McCawley's to link hisi wife, to her,.",
        "In the case of (4b), the problem is that there is no unique cookie to serve as the referent of it.",
        "Being an anaphoric pronoun linked to an antecedent does not necessarily mean that the two are coreferential, at least not in any naive sense of coreference.",
        "Even worse problem cases were known.",
        "(4c) is a typical \"Bach-and-Peters sentence,\" named after its inventors, Emmon Bach and Stanley Peters.",
        "As I was going to devote a chapter of my dissertation to this topic, I was lucky to run into them at a conference in San Diego.",
        "I found the two very intimidating in their suits and crew cuts.",
        "They looked like Haldeman and Ehrlichman, a pair of Nixon aides.",
        "But at least I found out that the problem had not been solved.",
        "As the year at RAND when on, I spent less and less time at the computer and a lot of time walking up and down the Santa Monica pier just down the cliff from my office thinking about pronouns, variables, reference, and definiteness.",
        "I went up to UCLA a few times to discuss these issues with Barbara Partee and gave a talk in her seminar.",
        "The topic of my dissertation was Problems of Reference in Syntax, in principle due before Ileft RAND but finished half-a-year later (Karttunen 1969a).",
        "By the summer of 19681 had two job offers.",
        "David Hays was leaving RAND for SUNY in Buffalo and he offered me a job there.",
        "But I chose to become a Faculty Associate in the Linguistics Department at the University of Texas at Austin.",
        "Climate was one consideration, but, more importantly, Austin was where Emmon Bach and Stanley Peters were.",
        "My Indiana mentor, Bob Wall, had just moved into the same department.",
        "For the next ten years I had very little contact with Martin Kay and Ronald Kaplan but they became very important people in Act II of my life."

McCawley, Paul Postal, and others) and interpretive semantics (Ray Jackendoff and others) had been won by Chomsky for the interpretivists, although Chomsky himself was, and still is, skeptical of any kind of formal theory of meaning.",

        "But it was going to take a while before I could do anything original within that emerging paradigm.",
        "At MIT I gave a \"formal methods\" course for a few linguistic students starting with Bob Wall's textbook (Wall 1972) and finishing with Montague Grammar that I was just learning about myself (Montague 1970a, 1970b, 1973; Partee 1995) and a seminar on my own topics: discourse referents, implicative verbs, and presuppositions.",
        "I had one star student in the seminar by the name of Mark Liberman, who wrote a Master's Thesis poking holes in my emerging ideas about presuppositions.",
        "In the 1970s, the Linguistics Department in Austin was an excellent place for a young semanticist.",

        "The projection principle for presuppositions, therefore, is as follows: presuppositions of a subordinate clause do not amalgamate either with presuppositions or assertions of higher clauses; rather they stand as presuppositions of the complex sentence in which they occur.",

        "In a conditional sentence, a presupposition of the consequent clause can be \"filtered\" or \"cancelled\" away if it is entailed by the antecedent and general background knowledge.",
        "If a presupposition is not filtered locally and is not part of the context of the discourse, the reader or hearer must in some way adjust his or her state of knowledge to incorporate the new information.",
        "The idea is in Karttunen (1974, page 191):",
        "If the current conversational context does not suffice, the listener is entitled and expected to extend it as required.",
        "He must determine for himself what context he is supposed to be in on the basis of what is said and, if he is willing to go along with it, make the same tacit extension that his interlocutor appears to have made.",
        "Lewis (1979) called this process accommodation.",
        "There is a huge literature on the projection problem and accommodation.",
        "Among the papers often cited are Karttunen (1999, page 5) sums up the early developments as follows:",
        "An especially stark illustration of the disparity of the field, at least in its early days, is the work of a Karttunen, who within the span of six years published three theories that were mutually inconsistent, technically as well as conceptually.",
        "I don't disagree with that assessment.",
        "It seems to me that by now the notions of presupposition projection and accommodation have outlived their usefulness.",
        "It is evident that no uniform theory can account for all the phenomena that historically have been lumped together under the label presupposition.",

        "The accommodation strategy for definite descriptions is closely linked to anaphora resolution (van der Sandt 1992).",

        "5 Except for the dismissive Gricean implications triggered by the indefinite article in a Karttunen.",
        "Assimilating presupposition projection into anaphora resolution is probably the right approach for definite descriptions and for iterative presuppositions triggered by prefixes such as rein verbs like recalculate and particles such as too and again.",
        "However, it does not seem applicable to the kinds of presuppositions triggered by implicative verbs or factives.",
        "But the whole idea of accommodation is inappropriate for implicative verbs.",
        "Examples such as (11) and (12) commit the speaker to the view that it was difficult for John to speak.",
        "The audience may take note of that piece of information but it does not need to be accepted or accommodated for the discourse to proceed.",
        "Another phenomenon that does not call for any accommodation is it-clefts.",
        "As Ellen Prince (1978) showed, a sentence such as (15) does not covertly slip into the discourse a piece of new information disguised as being old.",
        "On the contrary, the rhetorical force of the it-cleft is to tell you something that presumably you did not know before in a manner that makes the new piece of information incontestable.",
        "(15) It was/wasn't Barbara Partee who in a private conversation around 1980 suggested to me that anaphora resolution and the satisfaction of the presuppositions of definite descriptions was the same problem.",
        "In my joint last paper on presuppositions (Karttunen and Peters 1979), Stanley Peters and I proposed to do the sensible thing, namely to divide up the heterogeneous collection of phenomena that had been lumped together under this misbegotten label.",
        "We suggested that many cases that had been called presupposition are best seen as instances of what Grice (1979) had called conventional implicature.",
        "Conventional im-plicatures are propositions that the speaker or the author of the sentence is committed to by virtue of choosing particular words or constructions to express himself or herself.",
        "However, whether those implicatures are true or not does not have any bearing on whether the sentence is true or false.",
        "For example, because of the word even, (16) commits the author to the view that Bill is an unlikely person to agree with Mary.",
        "(16) Even Bill agrees with Mary.",
        "But the meaning contributed by even plays no role in determining the truth conditions of the sentence.",
        "(16) is true if Bill agrees with Mary and false otherwise.",
        "Our good advice went unheeded for a long time but in recent work by Christopher Potts (2004) we see an attempt to build the sort of two-dimensional semantics Stanley and I sketched out that separates conventional implicatures from truth-conditional aspects of meaning."
