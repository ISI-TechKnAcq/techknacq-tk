        "Kazakh language is a Turkic language which belongs to Kipchak branch of Ural-Altaic language family and it is spoken approximately by 8 million people.",
        "It is the official language of Kazakhstan and it has also speakers in Russia, China, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and Germany.",
        "It is closely related to other Turkic languages and there exists mutual intelligibility among them.",
        "Words in Kazakh language can be generated from root words recursively by adding proper suffixes.",
        "Thus, Kazakh language has agglutinative form and has vowel harmony property except for loan-words from other languages such as Russian, Persian and Arabic.",
        "Having a morphological analyzer for an agglutinative language is a starting point for Natural Language Processing (NLP) related researches.",
        "An analysis of inflectional affixes of Kazakh language is studied within the work of a Kazakh segmentation system (Altenbek and Wang, 2010).",
        "A finite state approach for Kazakh nominals is presented (Kairakbay and Zaurbekov, 2013) and it only gives specific alternation rules without generalized forms of alternations.",
        "Here we present all generalized forms of all alternation rules.",
        "Moreover, many studies and researches have been done upon on morphological analysis of Turkic languages (Altintas and Cicekli, 2001; Oflazer, 1994; Coltekin, 2010; Tantug et al., 2006; Orhun et al., 2009).",
        "However there is no complete work which provides a detailed computational analysis of Kazakh language morphology and this paper tries to do that.",
        "The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.",
        "Next section gives a brief comparison of Kazakh language and Turkish morphologies.",
        "Section 3 presents Kazakh vowel and consonant harmony rules.",
        "Then, nouns with their inflections are presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 4 also presents morphotactic rules for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs and numerals.",
        "The detailed morphological structure of verbs is introduced in Section 5.",
        "Results of the performed tests are presented together with their analysis in Section 6.",
        "At last, conclusion and future work are described in Section 7.",
        "2 Comparison of Closely Related Languages There are many studies and researches prior made on closely related languages by comparing them for many purposes related with NLP such as Turkish?Crimean Tatar (Altintas and Cicekli, 2001), Turkish?Azerbaijani (Hamzao?lu, 1993), Turkish?Turkmen (Tantu?",
        "et al., 2007), Turkish-Uygur (Orhun et al., 2009) and Tatar-Kazakh (Salimzyanov et al., 2013).",
        "A deep comparison of Kazakh and Turkish languages from computational view is another study which is in out of scope for this work.",
        "However, in this study, a brief grammatical comparison of these languages is given in order to give a better analysis of Kazakh language.",
        "46 Kazakh and Turkish languages have many common parts due to being in same language family.",
        "Possible differences are mostly morpheme based rather than deep grammar differences.",
        "Distinct morphemes can be added in order to get same meaning.",
        "There exist some differences in their alphabets, their vowel and consonant harmony rules, their possessive forms of nouns, and inflections of verbs as given in Table 1.",
        "There are extra 9 letters in Kazakh alphabet, and Kazakh alphabet also has 4 additional letters for Russian loan words.",
        "Both Kazakh language and Turkish employ vowel harmony rules when morphemes are added.",
        "Vowel harmony is defined according to last morpheme containing back or front vowel.",
        "In Kazakh language, if the last morpheme contains a back vowel then the vowel of next coming suffix is a or ?.",
        "If the last morpheme contains one of front vowels then the vowel of next coming suffix is e or i.",
        "In Turkish, suffixes with vowels a, ?, u follow morphemes with vowels a, o, u, ?",
        "and suffixes with vowels e, i, ?",
        "follow morphemes with vowels e, i, ?, ?",
        "depending on being rounded and unrounded vowels.",
        "Consonant harmony rule related with voiceless letters is similar in both languages.",
        "Turkish Kazakh Language Alphabet Latin 29 letters ( 8 Vowels, 21 Consonant ) Cyril 42 letters ( 10 Vowels, 25 Consonants, 3 Compound Letters, 4 Russian Loan Word Letters ) Vowel & Consonant Harmony Synharmonism according to back, front, unrounded and rounded vowels Synharmonism according to back and front vowels Possessive Forms of Nouns 6 types of possessive agreements 8 types of possessive agreements Case Forms of Nouns 7 Case Forms 7 Case Forms Verbs Similar Tenses Similar Tenses Table 1.",
        "Comparison of Kazakh and Turkish.",
        "In Kazakh language there are 8 types of personal possessive agreement morphemes as given in Table 2.",
        "Kazakh language has two additional possessive agreements for second person.",
        "There are some identical tenses and moods of verbs in both language such as definite past tense, present tense, imperative mood, optative mood and conditional mood.",
        "They have nearly same morphemes for tenses.",
        "On the other hand there are some tenses of verbs which are identical according to meaning and usage, but different morphemes are used.",
        "Moreover, in Kazakh language there are some tenses such as goal oriented future and present tenses which do not exist in Turkish language.",

        "3 Vowel and Consonant Harmony Kazakh is officially written in the Cyrillic alphabet.",
        "In its history, it was represented by Arabic, Latin and Cyrillic letters.",
        "Nowadays switching back to Latin alphabets in 20 years is planned by the Kazakh government.",
        "In the beginning stage of study, Latin transcription of Cyril version is used for convenience.",
        "Two main issues of language such as morphotactics and alternations can be dealt with Xerox tools.",
        "First of all, morphotactic rules are represented by encoding a finite-state network.",
        "Then, a finite-state transducer for alternations is constructed.",
        "Then, the formed network and the transducer are composed into a 47 single final network which cover all morphological aspects of the language such as morphemes, derivations, inflections, alternations and geminations (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003).",
        "Vowel harmony of Kazakh language obeys a rule such that vowels in each syllable should match according to being front or back vowel.",
        "It is called synharmonism and it is basic linguistic structure of nearly all Turkic languages (Demirci, 2006).",
        "For example, a word qa-la-lar-dIN, ?of cities?",
        "has a stem qa-la, ?city?",
        "and two syllables of containing back vowels according to the vowel harmony rule.",
        "Here ?lar is an affix of Plural form and ?dIN is an affix of Genitive case.",
        "However, as stated before, there are a lot of loan words from Persian and generally they do not obey vowel harmony rules.",
        "For example, a word mu-Ga-lim, ?teacher?",
        "has first two syllables have back vowels and the last one has a front vowel.",
        "So suffixes to be added are defined according to the last syllable.",
        "For example, a word muGalim-der-diN, ?of teachers?",
        "has suffixes with front vowels.",
        "On the other hand, there are morphemes with static front vowels which are independently from the type of last syllable can be added to all words such as Instrumental suffix ?men.",
        "In this case, all suffixes added after that should contain front vowels.",

        "Groups of Kazakh letters according to their sound.",
        "Upper case letters are used for non-Latin letters.",
        "In order to construct a finite-state transducer for alternation rules, there are some capital letters such as A, J, H, B, P, C, D, Q, K, T are defined in intermediate level and they are invisible by user.",
        "These representations are used for substitution such as A is for a and e and J is for I and i.",
        "So if suffix dA should be added according to morphotactic rules, it means suffixes da or de should be considered.",
        "In Table 3, there are group of letters defined according to their sounds and these groups are used in alternation rules (Valyaeva, 2007).",
        "Consonant harmony rules are varied according to the last letter of a word with in morphotactic rules.",
        "As in Table 3, different patterns are presented in order to visualize the relation between common valid rules and to generalize morphotactic rules.",
        "Thus, in each case according to morphotactic rules there are proper alternation rules for morphemes.",

        "Alternation rules according to groups of letters.",
        "All alternation rules for suffixes depend on the last letter of a morpheme with in morphotactic rules and Table 4 gives some groupings that can be made in order to set some generalized rules overall.",
        "Patterns of last letters of morphemes in Table 4 are matched with groups of letters presented in Table 3.",
        "In Table 4, Locative case affix is ?dA, if the last letter of a morpheme is one of Vowel, Sonorous 48 Consonant or Voiced Consonant of Type 1 in Table 3.",
        "On the other hand, it is ?tA, if the last letter is Voiceless Consonant or Voiced Consonant of Type 2.",
        "Here A is for a or e according to last syllable of containing Front or Back Vowel.",
        "In Table 4, boxes presented by numbers such as 1, 2 and 3 are used for personal possessive agreements in Table 2.",
        "For example, word Eke, ?father?",
        "in Ablative case without a possessive agreement takes suffix ?den, because the word Eke ends with vowel e. However, in third person possessive agreement it takes suffix ?nen, because all words with third person possessive agreement in Ablative case always take suffix ?nen even though the third person possessive agreement morpheme ends with vowel.",
        "According to those similarities in Table 4, there are some generalized rules which are valid in many cases in grammar including verbs and derivations.",
        "Some of these generalized rules derived from close patterns given in Table 4, are given in Table 5.",
        "For example, Rule 12 in Table 5 represents rules for Locative and Dative cases in Group 1 in Table 4.",
        "In Table 4, Locative and Dative suffix rules are nearly identical and have same patterns which can be observed visually.",
        "Also, Accusative and Possessive Pronouns of Type 2 are same.",

        "Generalized Rules.",
        "In Dative case of GROUP 1 in Table 4, if the last letter is Back Vowel then T is replaced by G and T is replaced by g if the last letter is Front Vowel.",
        "Thus, a word bala, ?child?",
        "becomes bala-Ga, ?to child?",
        "and a word Eke, ?father?",
        "will be Eke-ge, ?to father?.",
        "If the last letter is Voiceless Consonant, T is replaced by q or k depending on whether the last syllable contains Back Vowel or Front Vowel.",

        "A word mektep-ke, ?to school?",
        "has the last letter of Voiceless Consonant and the last syllable contains Front vowel, thus T is replaced by k. After detailed analysis of the language it can be seen that there are mainly common rules of alternations valid over all grammar.",
        "There are about 25 main alternation rules defined for all system together with generalized rules and 7 exception rules for each case.",
        "All these rules are implemented with XFST tools (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003).",

        "For example, in some resources there are twelve tenses, whereas in others there are much less tenses of verbs.",
        "Naming of tenses can also vary from source to source.",
        "To summarize, building correctly working system of morphological analysis by combining all information is valuable for further researches on language.",
        "In this paper, a detailed morphological analysis of Kazakh language has been performed.",
        "Also, a formalization of rules over all morphotactics of Kazakh languages is worked out.",
        "By combining all gained information, a morphological analyzer is constructed.",
        "For future work, enhancing of system by adding exception rules related with loan words and proper names should be performed.",
        "Having more stabilized system with lessened possible rule errors some internal details of character encoding will also be solved.",
        "Moreover, releasing the working system to users on the web and collecting feedbacks are intended.",
        "These feedbacks from users can help on improving the system capacity and lessen any possible errors.",
        "This is planned to be performed with using an open source environment which is alternative to Xerox XFST, namely Foma by Hulden (2009).",
