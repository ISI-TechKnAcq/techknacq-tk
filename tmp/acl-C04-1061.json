        "Manually annotating the rhetorical structure of texts is very labour-intensive.",
        "At the same time, high-quality automatic analysis is currently out of reach.",
        "We thus propose to split the manual annotation in two phases: the simpler marking of lexical connectives and their relations, and the more difficult decisions on overall tree structure.",
        "To this end, we developed an environment of two analysis tools and XML-based declarative resources.",
        "Our ConAno tool allows for efficient, interactive annotation of connectives, scopes and relations.",

        "A number of approaches tackling the difficult problem of automatic discourse parsing have been proposed in recent years (e.g., (Sumita et al., 1992) (Marcu, 1997), (Schilder, 2002)).",
        "They differ in their orientation toward symbolic or statistical information, but they all – quite naturally – share the assumption that the lexical connectives or discourse markers are the primary source of information for constructing a rhetorical tree automatically.",
        "The density of discourse markers in a text depends on its genre (e.g., commentaries tend to have more than narratives), but in general, it is clear that only a portion of the relations holding in a text is lexically signalled.1 Furthermore, it is well-known that discourse markers are often ambiguous; for example, the English but can, in terms of (Mann, Thompson, 1988), signal any of the relations Antithesis, Contrast, and Concession.",
        "Accordingly, automatic discourse parsing focusing on connectives is bound to have its limitations.",
        "Our position is that progress in discourse parsing relies on the one hand on a more thorough understanding of the underlying issues, and on the other hand on the availability of human-annotated corpora, which can serve as a resource for in-depth studies of discourse-structural phenomena, and also for training statistical analysis programs.",
        "Two examples of such corpora are the RST Tree Corpus by (Marcu et al., 1999) for English and the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) for German.",
        "Producing such resources is a labour-intensive task that requires time, trained annotators, and clearly specified guidelines on what relation to choose under which circumstances.",
        "Nonetheless, rhetorical analysis remains to be in part a rather subjective process (see section 2).",
        "In order to eventually arrive at more objective, comparable results, our proposal is to split the annotation process into two parts:",
        "1.",
        "Annotation of connectives, their scopes (the two related textual units), and – optionally – the signalled relation 2.",
        "Annotation of the remaining (unsignalled) relations between larger segments",
        "Step 1 is inspired by work done for English in the Penn Discourse TreeBank2 (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "In our two-step scenario, it is the easier part of the whole task in that connectives can be quite clearly identified, their scopes are often (but not always, see below) transparent, and the coherence relation is often clear.",
        "We see the result of step 1 as a corpus resource in its own right (it can be used for training statistical classifiers, for instance) and at the same time as the input for step 2, which “fills the gaps”: now annotators have to decide how the set of small trees produced in step 1 is best arranged in one complete tree, which involves assigning",
        "relations to instances without any lexical signals and also making more complicated scope judgements across larger spans of text – the more subjective and also more time-consuming step.3 Our approach is as follows.",
        "To speed up the annotation process in step 1, we have developed an XML format and a dedicated analysis tool called ConAno, which will be introduced in Section 4.",
        "ConAno can export the annotated text in the ‘rs3’ format that serves as input to O’Donnell’s RST Tool (O’Donnell, 1997).",
        "His original idea was that manual annotation be done completely with his tool; we opted however to use it only for step 2, and will motivate the reasons for this overall architecture in Section"

        "There are two different perspectives on the task of discourse parsing: an “ideal” one that aims at modelling a systematic, incremental process; and an “empirical” one that takes the experiences of human annotators into account.",
        "“Ideally”, discourse analysis proceeds incrementally from left to right, where for each new segment, an attachment point and a relation (or more than one of each, cf. SDRT) are computed and the discourse structure grows step by step.",
        "This view is taken for instance in SDRT (Asher, Las-carides, 2003), which places emphasis on the notion of ‘right frontier’ (also discussed recently by (Webber et al., 2003)).",
        "However, when we trained two (experienced) students to annotate the 171 newspaper commentaries of the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) and upon completion of the task asked them about their experiences, a very different picture emerged.",
        "Both annotators agreed that a strict left-to-right approach is highly impractical, because the intended argumentative structure of the text often becomes clear only in retrospect, after reflecting the possible contributions of the segments to the larger scheme.",
        "Thus they very soon settled on a bottom-up approach: First, mark the transparent cases, in which a connective undoubtedly signals a relation between two segments.",
        "Then, see how the resulting pieces fit together into a structure that mirrors the argument presented.",
        "The annotators used RST Tool (O’Donnell, 1997), which worked reasonably well for the purpose.",
        "However, since we also have in our group an XML-based lexicon of German connectives at our disposal (Berger et al., 2002), why not use this resource to speed up the first phase of the annotation?"

        "From the syntactic viewpoint, they are a rather inhomogeneous group consisting of subordinating and coordinating conjunctions, some prepositions, and a number of sententence adverbials.",
        "We refer to the two related units as an ‘internal’ and an ‘external’ one, where the ‘internal’ one is the unit of which the connective is actually a part.",
        "For example, in Despite the heavy rain we had a great time, the noun phrase the heavy rain is the internal unit, since it forms a syntactic phrase together with the preposition.",

        "(‘Berlin, too, could – at least if the federation shows some gratitude in order to alleviate the emergency of its capital – profit from it.’) The DTD introduces XML tags for each of the connectives (<connective>), their possible modifiers (<modifier>) and respective discourse units (<unit>, where the type can be filled by int or ext), as well as the entire text (<discourse>).",
        "Henceforth, we will refer to the text unit containing the connective as the internal, ‘int-unit’ and to the other, external, one as ‘ext-unit’.",
        "Using this DTD, it is possible to represent the range of problematic phenomena discussed in the previous section.",
        "Connective or not: Only those words actually used as connectives will be marked with the <connective> tag, while others such as the frequently occurring und (‘and’) or oder (‘or’) will remain unmarked, if they merely conjoin items in a list.",
        "Which relation: The <connective> tag includes a rel attribute for optional specification of the rhetorical relation that holds between the connected clauses.",
        "Complex connectives: Using an XML based annotation scheme, we can easily mark phrasal connectives such as aus diesem Grund (‘for this reason’) using the <connective> tag.",
        "In order for discontinuous connectives to be annotated correctly, we introduce an id attribute that provides every connective with a distinct reference number.",
        "This way connectives such as entweder ... oder, (‘either ... or’) can be represented as belonging together.",
        "(see <connective id=\"4\" rel=\"condition\"> tags in Figure 2) Multiple connectives/relations: In our annotation scheme, complex connectives such as aber dennoch, (‘but still’) are treated as two distinct connectives that indicate different relations holding between the same units.",
        "Modified connectives: Connective modifiers are marked with a special <modifier> tag, which is embedded inside the <connective> tag, as shown with jedenfalls modifying dann in our example.",
        "Hence an additional id attribute for this tag is not necessary.",
        "Embedded segments: Discourse units are marked using the <unit> tag, which also provides an id attribute.",
        "On the one hand, this is used for assigning discourse units to their respective connectives, on the other hand it provides a way of dealing with discountinuous discourse units, as the example shows.",
        "A range of relatively generic linguistic annotation tools are available today, but none of them turned out suitable for our purposes: We seek a very easy-to-use, platform-independent tool for mouse-marking ranges of text and having them associated with one another.",
        "Consequently, we decided to implement our own Java-based tool, ConAno, which is geared especially to connective/scope annotation and thus can have a very intuitive user interface.",
        "Just like discourse parsers do, ConAno exploits the fact that connectives are the most reliable source of information.",
        "Rather than attempting an automatic disambiguation, however, ConAno merely makes suggestions to the human analyst, which she might follow or discard.",
        "In particular, ConAno loads a list of (potential) connectives, and when annotation of a text begins, highlights each candidate so that the user can either confirm (by marking its scope) or discard (by mouse-click) it if it not used as a connective.",
        "Furthermore, the connective list optionally may contain associated coherence relations, which are then also offered to the user for selection.",
        "This annotation phase is thus purely data-driven: Attention is paid only to the connectives and their specific relation candidates.",
        "To elaborate a little, the annotation process proceeds as follows.",
        "The text is loaded into the annotation window, and the first potential connective is automatically highlighted.",
        "Potential preposed or postposed modifiers, if any, of the connective are also highlighted (in a different color).",
        "The user moves with the mouse from one connective to the next and",
        "• can with a mouseclick discard a highlighted item (it is not a connective or not a modifier), • can call up a help window explaining the syntactic behavior and the relations of this connective, • can call up a suggestion for the int-unit (i.e., text portion is highlighted), • can analogously call up a suggestion for the ext-unit, • can choose from a menu of the relations associated with this connective.",
        "the connective; we use simple rules like “search up to the next comma” to find the likely int-unit for a subjunctor, or “search the preceding two full-stops” to find the ext-unit for an adverbial (the preceding sentence).",
        "The suggestions may be wrong; then the user discards them and marks them with the mouse herself.",
