        "The quality of annotated data for computational linguistics is generally assumed to be good enough if a few annotators can be shown to be consistent with one another.",
        "Metrics such as pairwise agreement and agreement coefficients measure consistency among annotators.",
        "These descriptive statistics do not support inferences about corpus quality or annotator accuracy, and the absolute values one should aim for are debatable, as in the review by Artstein and Poesio (2008).",
        "We argue that high chance-adjusted inter-annotator agreement is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure high quality gold-standard labels.",
        "Agreement measures reveal little about differences among annotators, and nothing about the certainty of the true label, given the observed labels from annotators.",
        "In contrast, a probabilistic model of annotation supports statistical inferences about the quality of the observed and inferred labels.",
        "This paper presents a case study of a particularly thorny annotation task that is of widespread interest, namely word-sense annotation.",
        "The items that were annotated are occurrences of selected words in their sentence contexts, and the annotation labels are WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The annotations, collected through crowdsourc-ing, consist of one WordNet sense for each item from up to twenty-five different annotators, giving each word instance a large set of labels.",
        "Note that application of an annotation model does not require this many labels for each item, and crowdsourced annotation data does not require a probabilistic model.",
        "This case study, however, does demonstrate a mutual benefit.",
        "A highly certain ground truth label for each annotated instance is the ultimate goal of data annotation.",
        "Many issues, however, make this complicated for word sense annotation.",
        "The number of different senses defined for a word varies across lexical resources, and pairs of senses within a single sense inventory are not equally distinct (Ide and Wilks, 2006; Erk and McCarthy, 2009).",
        "A previous annotation effort using WordNet sense labels demonstrates a great deal of variation across words (Passonneau et al., 2012b).",
        "On over 116 words, chance-adjusted agreement ranged from very high to chance levels.",
        "As a result, the ground truth labels for many words are questionable.",
        "On a random subset of 45 of the same words, the crowdsourced data presented here (available as noted below) yields a certainty measure for each ground truth label indicating high certainty for most instances."

        "The case study of word sense annotation presented here demonstrates that in comparison to current practice for assessment of annotated corpora, an annotation model applied to crowdsourced labels provides more knowledge and higher quality gold standard labels at lower cost.",
        "Those who would use the corpus for training benefit because they can differentiate high from low confidence labels.",
        "Cross-site evaluations of word sense disambiguation systems could benefit because there are more evaluation options.",
        "Where the most probable label is relatively uncertain, systems can be penalized less for an incorrect but close response (e.g., log loss).",
        "Systems that produce sense rankings for each instance could be scored using metrics that compare probability distributions, such as Kullbach-Leibler divergence (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000).",
        "Wider use of annotation models should lead to more confidence from users in corpora for training or evaluation."
