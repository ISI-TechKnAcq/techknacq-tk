        "Thus, for example, if language generation is required there is typically 100% re-usability across domains in contrast to the 130% described by Widen], 1993] for the, largely non-linguistically motivated, 1,11,001 ontology.' There are a. nuinber of suggestions for the evaluation of ontologies in terms of formal properties of consistence and coherence of the information those ontologies contain (e.g., [Iloracek, 1989, Guarino, 1994]).",
