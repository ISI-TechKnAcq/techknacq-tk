        "The large economic potential of automatic text processing is leading to an increasing interest in its commercial applications.",
        "This paper describes a pilot version of a commercial application of natural language processing techniques to the problem of categorizing news stories into broad topic categories.",
        "The conventional way to process natural language texts is to have people read them and perform some action based on what they have read.",
        "People, for instance, currently categorize news stories for routing purposes and extract information from banking payment telexes so that transactions can be executed.",
        "Unfortunately, using people tends to be:",
        "• slow - people read text slowly; • expensive - if the volume of text is high, processing it requires the efforts of many people; • inconsistent - it is very hard to get a group of people to make consistent decisions about text.",
        "In many cases, the proper processing of text is central to a company's revenue stream, so that improvements in the processing can provide major leverage and justify major contract system expenditures.",
        "Automatic text processing offers the possibility of such improvements in all three areas.",
        "A single text processing machine can potentially do the job of several people faster, cheaper, and more consistently.",
        "This paper describes an implementation of a system to do text categorization.",
        "The texts it operates on are news stories, but similar techniques could be employed on electronic mail messages, telex traffic, technical abstracts, etc.. Once categorization has been accomplished, the results can be used to route the texts involved to interested parties or to facilitate later retrieval of the texts from an archival database.",
        "The system described here uses the well-established natural language processing technique of pattern-matching [1, 5].",
        "Since the input to the system is an arbitrary news story on any topic whatsoever, no attempt is made to perform a complete syntactic or semantic analysis.",
        "Instead, categorization is based on the presence of particular words and phrases in particular lexical contexts.",
        "As the more detailed description in Section 3 will make clear, however, the approach used goes well beyond the keyword approaches used in information retrieval (e.g. [6]).",
        "In particular, the words and phrases the system looks for and the context in which it looks for them are specified through a modified version of the powerful pattern matching language used in Carnegie Group's Language CraftTM product' [3].",
        "Moreover, the system determines which words and phrases to search for in a given story and how to interpret the presence of these words and phrases according to knowledge-based rules.",
        "As simple as these techniques are by current natural language processing standards, the accuracy of the system is high.",
        "As described in more detail in Section 4, the system had an average accuracy of",
        "93%2 on a sample of 500 random stories that had not been previously processed by the system or seen by its developers.",
        "Moreover, this accuracy was obtained without sacrificing computational efficiency.",
        "The average processing time was 15 seconds per story3 on a Symbolics 3640, a figure which we believe could be considerably improved through a detailed performance optimization which we have not performed.",
        "The remaining sections of the paper describe in more detail: the problem tackled by the system, the approach used, and the results obtained."

      "text": [
        "The primary goal in developing the system described in this paper was to demonstrate the feasibility of categorizing news stories by computer in small amounts of time (a few seconds) using natural language processing techniques.",
        "The specific task chosen to do this was emulation of the performance of a group of human categorizers.",
        "Our raw material was a data base containing many thousands of news stories that had been hand-categorized4 for any of 72 categories.",
        "Our system was required to assign 6 of the 72 categories: acquisitions/mergers, metals, shipping, bonds, war, and disorders.",
        "A story could be assigned one or more of these codes, or no code at all if none of the chosen six was appropriate.",
        "The restriction to six codes was imposed to keep the effort required to build the system within certain budgetary limits.",
        "As Section 3 will show, the approach taken is equally applicable to the larger set of categories.",
        "Modelling the categorizations produced by human beings presented some difficulties.",
        "To summarize: • The text processing techniques used in the system were oriented to identifying concepts explicitly mentioned in a story.",
        "They were not",
        "well suited to identifying the class of people that a story might be of interest to.",
        "The human categorizers of the stories in our data base used both these kinds of considerations when they assigned topic codes to stories.",
        "• Some topic codes had relatively vague, subjective definitions.",
        "• The human categorizers were not always consistent in the way they made their topic assignments.",
        "The news stories themselves posed another challenge.",
        "Though the set of topics to be assigned by the system was narrowed from 72 to 6, there was no parallel narrowing of the stream of stories that would serve as input to the system.",
        "The full range of story types found in a newspaper occurred in the data base of news stories.",
        "As a consequence, our task was not the relatively simple one of, for instance, distinguishing a story about war from one about bonds.",
        "War stories also had to be distinguished from military, disaster, crime, diplomacy, politics, and sports stories, to name just a few.",
        "It was often the case that we could characterize the kind of stories that might mislead the system.",
        "We were prepared for sports stories that looked like metals stories (\"...captured the gold medal at the summer Olympics...\") or like war/disorders stories (\"...the battle on center court at Wimbledon...\").",
        "A more difficult challenge was posed by words and phrases that were good predictors of a particular topic but occurred randomly across all story types, sometimes with the same meaning, sometimes not.",
        "For instance, the noun note, in the sense of financial instrument, was useful for finding stories about bonds; however, numerous, random stories used that word in a different sense.",
        "Metaphorical language was also a problem -- not use of fixed phrases (we had no trouble failing to assign the category metals to a story that contained the phrase like a lead balloon) -- but rather creative metaphorical language.",
        "So, a story about a series of battles in the continuing disposable diaper war between Proctor and Gamble and its competitors was assigned to the disorders category."

        "led to the topic's being hypothesized was used in a way that misled the system; it is this phase, for instance, that would detect that conflict vocabulary was being used in the context of a sports story and disconfirm the war and disorders categories for that story.",
        "This phase thus has an expert system flavor to it.",
        "Both phases use the same basic kind of processing: a contextually limited search for words and phrases using pattern-matching techniques.",

        "The concepts associated with patternsets sometimes correspond to the topics we are trying to categorize stories into, but they may also be more specific or may span several topics.",
        "The basic operation on a patternset is to determine how many of the words and phrases it represents appear in a story.",
        "System actions are taken when the number of matches crosses a threshold, at which point we say that the pattemset has matched.",

        "The precision scores are actually higher than the corresponding recall scores in the case of war and bonds.",
        "Since we have found that precision can be traded off against recall by appropriate manipulation of thresholds associated with our rulebase, this suggests that the recall rate for those two topics could be further improved while still maintaining an acceptable precision rate.",
        "The adjustment procedure also allowed us to",
        "measure the performance of the hand-categorizers.",
        "While adjusted precision scores were perfect for all six topics, adjusted recall scores ranged from 81% to 100%, with an average of 94%.",
        "While human performance on precision is clearly superior to that of the system, the average recall rates of human categorizers and of the system are very similar (94% v. 93%).",
        "Closer examination of the results, however, shows that the kind of errors made are quite different.",
        "Human errors stem mainly from inconsistent application of categories, especially the categories with the vaguest definitions, and from failing to specify all the categories when several should have been assigned to a story.",
        "System errors on the other hand stem largely from misinterpretation of the way in which language is being used.",
        "This sometimes results in ridiculous categorizations of a kind that humans never produce.",
        "Out of 500 stories, the system produced a total of 28 \"lemons\" (stories that were clearly assigned the wrong categories).",
        "We analyzed these stories and discovered six sources of errors:",
        "• The system did not match useful words or phrases, or the disconfirmation rules were too powerful.",
        "• The topic vocabulary was not much used in the story.",
        "• The system used the story background to derive the topic.",
        "• The topic vocabulary came too late in the story.",
        "• The topic vocabulary was used with different meanings.",
        "• The topic vocabulary was used with the same meaning, but different focus.",
        "Examples and further discussion follow.",
        "Some stories did not use the topic vocabulary more than one or two times.",
        "Setting thresholds very low would catch these stories, but generate many false positives as well.",
        "Most stories that had this problem were also very short, so we added length-dependent thresholds to address the problem.",
        "This technique worked for metals stories, where the vocabulary is somewhat distinctive, but would not work for acquisitions stories, where the vocabulary consists of very common words like buy and sell."
