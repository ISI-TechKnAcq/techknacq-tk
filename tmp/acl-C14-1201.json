        "Coreference resolution is the task of partitioning mentions in a document, usually noun phrases, into clusters which correspond to their real world referents.",
        "It is typically approached as a classification task between mentions; given a set of mentions, systems predict the likelihood of their being coreferential with one another and translate these scores into a clustering in a decoding phase.",
        "The task has received considerable research attention due to its importance for downstream inference in tasks such as named entity linking and relation extraction.",
        "While simple, local models of coreference have established a reasonable baseline, encoding global consistency requirements remains a challenge since their complete representation is computationally intractable.",
        "Two promising but orthogonal directions addressing the need for global consistency measures are ranking-based decoding (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Denis et al., 2007; Fernandes et al., 2012; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Chang et al., 2013) and cluster-based modelling (Rahman and Ng, 2009; Raghunathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Klenner and Tuggener, 2011).",
        "However, among current systems, decoding strategies are increasingly complex and cluster-based models do not fully leverage psycholinguistic cues such as reading order.",
        "The primary contribution of our work is a reconceptualisation of the coreference task by analogy with the shift-reduce parsing algorithm.",
        "This reconceptualisation allows us to capitilise on both ranking- and cluster-based approaches and our system, LIMERIC, outperforms systems using either approach in isolation.",
        "We go beyond the shift-reduce algorithm by interpreting our stack of partially formed clusters as a reader's mental status while reading.",
        "This allows us to introduce a series of rich discourse features which capture antecedent competition and cognitive accessiblity via a cluster's position in the stack.",
        "Our system is simple and efficient, using maximum-margin averaged perceptron classification and optional beam-search decoding during inference.",
        "Despite requiring only a limited amount of memory, our system achieves the competitive CoNLL scores of 63.33 and 62.91 on the CoNLL-2012 DEV and TEST splits of the OntoNotes 5 corpus (Pradhan et al., 2012).",
        "We argue that this is due to its more faithful representation of cognitive processing and that extending psycholinguistic insights in modelling is a very promising research direction for even further improvement.",
        "2129 2 Related work Early computational approaches to coreference resolution were built around what is now referred to as mention-pair models.",
        "Such models use two stage resolution; the first stage calculates pairwise scores reflecting the likelihood that a mention and its candidate antecedents are coreferential while the second phase decodes these scores into coreference clusters.",
        "The simplest way to decode is locationally greedy (Soon et al., 2001), in that the closest candidate with a compatibility score over some threshold is deemed a mention's antecedent.",
        "Anaphoricity determination (determining whether a mention constitutes a good first mention of an entity) is mediated by the threshold since a mention without a sufficiently good candidate antecedent starts a new cluster.",
        "While these local models achieve a reasonable baseline (Soon et al. (2001) achieves MUC F-scores of 62.6 and 60.4 on MUC 6 and 7), they can make global consistency errors which limit their usefulness downstream.",
        "For instance, in the following excerpt from bn/voa/00/voa 0068 of OntoNotes 5, it is possible that a system uses local evidence such as synonymy to misclassify the ship as the antecedent of a huge Norwegian transport vessel and similarly The battered US Navy destroyer Cole as the antecendent of the ship; unfortunately, these local decisions imply a clustering in which Cole is referred to as a Norwegian transport vessel.",
        "The battered US Navy destroyer Cole has begun its journey home from Yemen ...",
        "Flanked by other US warships and guarded by aircraft, the ship was towed out of Aden Harbor to rendezvous with a huge Norwegian transport vessel While exhaustive comparison would remedy the situation, complete inference has exponential time complexity and so is unrealistic for practical systems.",
        "Furthermore, since humans are able to resolve reference on the fly, it seems reasonable that psycholinguistic heuristics would similarly help the task while remaining efficient.",
        "Active research aims to approximately encode global consistency measures, via ranking-based decoding and cluster-level modelling.",
        "Ranking-based decoding strategies (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Denis et al., 2007) improve locationally greedy decoding by defining a search window and deeming the best, rather than the closest, candidate within the window to be a mention's antecedent.",
        "The publicly available Reconcile system 1 (Stoyanov et al., 2010a; Stoyanov et al., 2010b) uses a simple encoding of this strategy while more recent approaches (Fernandes et al., 2012; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Chang et al., 2013) incorporate the concept within highly sophisticated models.",
        "While these systems achieve state of the art performance, they do so at the expense of model complexity.",
        "In cluster-level modelling approaches (Rahman and Ng, 2009; Raghunathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Klenner and Tuggener, 2011), instead of basing scoring on the compatibility of pairs of mentions, mentions are compared against incrementally grown partial clusters.",
        "This, for instance, may allow a huge Norwegian transport vessel to be compared against a cluster containing both the ship and The battered US Navy destroyer Cole, allowing nationality discord to weigh against the clustering.",
        "In this way, global consistency information becomes more important as a mention needs to be compatible with multiple mentions in a cluster, rather than its closest or best antecedent.",
        "However, there have been problems with these implementations including their being heavily focussed on surface level features and failing to fully utilise psycholinguistic cues such as reading order.",
        "A notable exception is Recasens et al. (2013), which provides a computational model of low salience discourse entities and demonstrates its efficacy in filtering system mentions in the Stanford sieve system (Raghunathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011).",
        "Consistent with Klenner and Tuggener (2011) and others, we argue that psycholinguistic insight is the key to unite cluster- and ranking-based models.",
        "This is because theories such as Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and Accessibility Theory (Ariel, 2001) describe how the human mind keeps track of discourse referents as entities rather than distinct mentions, and resolves anaphora via ranked cognitive accessibility.",
        "By reformulating the coreference resolution by analogy with the shift-reduce parsing algorithm, we gain access to the stack of active discourse entities which we rank in order of salience.",
        "In this way, the stack in our model becomes an approximation of a reader's mental state when reading a document, allowing us to directly model cognitive models of discourse.",
        "1 http://www.cs.utah.edu/nlp/reconcile 2130 a huge Norwegian transport vesselNEW Aden Harbor the ship its the battered US Navy destroyer Cole shift reduce 0 reduce 1 Figure 1: shift-reduce comparisons, bn/voa/00/voa 0068 3 Psycholinguistically informed coreference resolution The shift-reduce algorithm (Aho and Johnson, 1974) is widely used in parsing due to its efficiency, the simplicity of its data structures, and its limited memory usage.",
        "For syntactic parsing, a queue is initialised with a series of tokens which is processed in a single reading order pass.",
        "Tokens either shift onto a stack as a leaf fragment or reduce with an existing fragment to former a larger phrasal unit.",
        "For the reduce operation, the classifier needs to determine into which fragment the token should merge.",
        "By drawing an analogy between tokens and phrases in syntactic parsing with mentions and clusters in coreference resolution, we derive an algorithm for the latter.",
        "In particular, we can initialise a queue of mentions and maintain a stack of clusters which incrementally grow as we read a document.",
        "Our classifier is similarly tasked with determining whether a mention should shift onto the stack as the first mention of a new discourse entity or should reduce with an already active one (see Figure 1 for the example of resolving the enqueued mention a huge Norwegian transport vessel).",
        "For reduce operations, we additionally need to determine into which entity cluster the mentions should merge.",
        "In this way, the shift-reduce algorithm expresses a joint decision of anaphoricity and coreferentiality.",
        "We draw from shift-reduce parsing its simplicity and small memory requirement since we believe these give rise to a more faithful representation of cognitive processing.",
        "There are, however, some technical points to consider.",
        "Instead of the reduce operation applying to a small window at the top of the stack (top two in the case of binarised grammars), we want to search potentially the whole stack, as described the general formulation of the algorithm.",
        "While a full search gives our process worst case O(n 2 ) time complexity, this is only occurs in the case of an incoherent document which mentions each of its discourse entities exactly once.",
        "In the average case, exhaustive stack search still represents a time saving compared to full mention-pair models which compare each mention against all potential antecedent mentions.",
        "Also, we don't aim to form a single full tree covering all the mentions but rather a collection of clusters.",
        "While it is possible to define a document graph of coreference relations (as demonstrated in Fernandes et al. (2012)), it is not necessary to do so.",
        "The algorithms we employ for training and inference our system are represented in Figure 2.",
        "Initialisation We initialise the stack to be empty and the queue to be the complete set of mentions extracted from the parse structure and named entities in a document.",
        "Following the literature, our mention extraction module is designed to be high recall since missed mentions are guaranteed to hurt performance, while it is possible to learn that spurious mentions should not be reported (e.g. Durrett and Klein (2013)).",
        "Thus, we train and test on predicted mentions despite the availability of gold mentions for training (to keep system input as similar as possible between training and testing environments) and at test time (since this is not realistic).",
        "In this way, we learn a model that is robust to noise in mention extraction.",
        "Learning On each training pass through a document, we read the enqueued mentions exactly once, in reading order without look ahead.",
        "As each mention comes to head the queue, we generate a training instance in which the classifier decides whether it is more likely that the mention shift onto the stack as the first mention of a new discourse entity or reduce with the cluster of an already active one.",
        "In particular, the reduce score 2131 initialise queue; initialise stack; while queue do active = queue.pop(); prediction = classify(active, stack); gold = correct classification(active, stack); if prediction != gold then update(prediction, gold); end cluster = apply pred(active, stack, gold); promote(cluster, stack); end initialise queue; initialise stacks; while queue do active = queue.pop(); forall stacks do prediction = classify(active, stack); cluster = apply pred(active, stack, prediction); promote(cluster, stack); end prune stacks(stacks); end Figure 2: learning (left) and inference (right) algorithms is the highest of all potential merges.",
        "Features are generated on the fly to reduce memory requirements, and because the state of the system is determined by each move made.",
        "The margin of classification is widened by augmenting by one the scores corresponding to non-gold decisions.",
        "We then determine whether any difference exists between the classifier's decision and the gold answer key by looking for one of five errors, three taken from Durrett and Klein (2013) (falsely anaphoric, falsely new, wrong link made) and two inspired by the categories used in Kummerfeld and Klein (2013) (extra mention and extra entity).",
        "If an error is detected, we perform perceptron updates of the feature weights, increasing those corresponding to the gold decision and decreasing those corresponding to the incorrect prediction.",
        "We find that varying the feature value update according to the error made has a performance benefit, particularly when ?falsely new?",
        "is given a faster learning rate.",
        "This may due to sparsity: across a corpus, the number of first mentions of an entity is smaller than both that of subsequent mentions, and singleton mentions.",
        "We note that it should be possible to learn a model using uniform updates by increasing the number of training iterations, though this increases the chance of overfitting.",
        "Also, tuning these parameters may affect different balances in error types for different applications.",
        "As noted in Rahman and Ng (2009), since the mention-cluster indicator functions do not apply to the case where a new entity is formed (shift operations), reduce comparisons activate many more features than shift ones do.",
        "During development, we noticed that this marked difference in feature set size was negatively impacting performance as reduce operations were unfairly favoured.",
        "To grow the shift feature weights faster, we introduced a scaling parameter on the update of these feature weights; we found the ratio of the feature space sizes to work well.",
        "As the final stage, the system applies the decided move.",
        "There are two valid ?decided?",
        "moves, namely the correct decision, read from the gold standard, or the (potentially incorrect) predicted decision.",
        "In this work, we train by following the path of correct decisions, though we plan future research implementing the latter.",
        "We hope this will improve the robustness of our system given analogous findings in shift-reduce parsing (Zhang and Nivre, 2012).",
        "Novel to our approach, the cluster resulting from application of the decided move is promoted to the top of the stack since recency increases cognitive accessibility.",
        "This is a crucial implementation detail given the cognitive interpretation we give to the stack of clusters.",
        "Inference A benefit of our formulation of the coreference task is that inference is little different to training, without feature weight tuning.",
        "In both, documents are processed via a queue of mentions, though a single stack is replaced by possibly multiple in a beam regularly pruned to a fixed width.",
        "This has possible cognitive underpinnings since humans need to be able to back track if an interpretation proves incorrect.",
        "Analo-gously, it allows our system to reduce the impact of potentially harmful local decisions.",
        "Interestingly, we find in Section 6 that this has little appreciable impact on performance, though this is consistent with Zhang and Nivre (2012), which finds that beam search in inference can hurt the performance of a shift-reduce syntactic parser trained on gold decisions.",
        "2132 4 Rich discourse features We base our feature space on the pool of features described in the literature (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Bengtson and Roth, 2008; Stoyanov et al., 2010a; Stoyanov et al., 2010b; Raghunathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011).",
        "We introduce Discourse likelihood as a novel extension of work in Recasens et al. (2013), designed to mediate system conservativeness in the decision between whether a cluster remains a singleton or grows into a larger cluster.",
        "Conjunct discord is introduced as a finer grained extension of traditional number agreement features.",
        "If existing features apply to single mentions or single clusters, they apply in this same way in our system.",
        "To map the mention-pair features in the literature into functions which take a mention-cluster pair, we use a range of strategies including the existence of a compatible mention for the active among the cluster pool (Raghunathan et al., 2010), binned proportion of clustered mentions compatible with the active mention (Rahman and Ng, 2009), or the maximum compatibility score between the clustered mentions and the active one (based on Ponzetto and Strube (2006)).",
        "The examples here correspond to the reduce 1 move in Figure 1.",
        "Lexical data driven lexicalised features from Durrett and Klein (2013); for the active mention the ship, we would generate the features like head word:ship first pos:DT last shape:LOWER String match existence and proportion of clustered mentions with various string matches with the active mention, e.g. head match:none acronym:none Attribute agreement agreement in animacy, gender, number, and NER values pooled across the cluster, and active, e.g.number agree:true Attribute discord where mentions are conjunctions, disagreement between the number of sibling NP children; disagreement between the citation form of any pronouns in cluster and active Syntax existence of i-within-i (restriction on anaphora due to government and binding requirements on a sentence's parse tree) or subject-object relation between active and any clustered mention e.g.iwithini:none Semantics binned value of maximum Lin et al. (2012) similarity score between active and clustered mention heads, e.g. lin:high since ship and vessel are highly related; disagreement between coarse grained semantic classes of nominals determined from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) Length length of mention in number of tokens mlength:3; length of cluster in number of mentions Distance distance between active and closest clustered mention, measured in number of sentences and number of intervening mentions Discourse patterns whether any subsequent mention is an indefinite nominal Discourse likelihood an integer value representing the likelihood that cluster has proposed length (sin- gleton or not) given the internal morphosyntactics of the clustered mentions; likelihood of stack given likelihood of contained clusters 4.1 Stack features Since position in stack in our model represents relative cognitive accessibility, we introduce Depth features as the cognitive analogues of Distance features, designed to more faithfully represent accessibility.",
        "Stack depth depth from top of the stack, binned as top cluster in stack, within five clusters from the top, within ten clusters from the top, outside this 2 ; raw depth, depth normalised in turn by ignoring singletons and ignoring clusters not containing a proper name mention raw depth:high, ne depth:top were all used, with the last two designed to capture the impact of salience 2 these values were empirically optimised, though we note that they reflect known constraints on human short-term memory 2133 a co-presidentNEW She ... animacy agree:True-compete c-l?hood:0 animacy agree:True c-l?hood:0-compete Figure 3: stack features, bn/mnb/00/mnb 0023 Stack competition In an aim to model the competition between clusters in the stack, we introduce stack competition features.",
        "In addition to evaluating our mention-cluster features between the active mention and its proposed antecedent, we also evaluate them between it and the other clusters comprising the stack.",
        "If a stacked cluster evaluates positively with any of these, we generate a labelled version of the indicated feature.",
        "By having these features compete with those of the proposed antecedent, we hope to better learn a more global ranking of candidates than straightforward search window strategies do.",
        "Figure 3 shows how stack features can be used to distinguish between the attractiveness of merging an indefinite nominal into a cluster (attractive due to matching linguistic attributes) as compared to starting a new discourse entity (attractive due to discourse likelihood of indefinite nominal in a new cluster).",
        "4.2 Discourse transition prefixing After Durrett and Klein (2013), we use discourse transition strings formed from the types of the mention and its closest candidate antecedent as feature prefixes, e.g. m:nominal+a:nominal.",
        "While this inflates the potential size of the feature space 3 , the features generated are more meaningful since we would expect many indicator functions to behave differently for pronouns than for subsequent proper names, for example, reintroducing entities.",
        "Also, since we use perceptron learning, feature weights are only tuned if the feature is useful in making a decision during training.",
        "5 Results We evaluate LIMERIC on the OntoNotes 5 corpus (Pradhan et al., 2012) with the included parse and NER annotations.",
        "Our experimental setup matches the specifications of the CoNLL-2012 shared task: we use the standard corpus splits, official scorer, and report performance on the CoNLL metric which averages the MUC F-score (Vilain et al., 1995), B 3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAFE (Luo, 2005).",
        "We compare our performance against that of three state of the art systems which reflect the diversity of current approaches.",
        "Stanford 4 (Lee et al., 2011) has rule-based decoding with cluster-based modelling.",
        "Berkeley 5 (Durrett and Klein, 2013) uses mention-pair features in a factor graph model.",
        "Since reported performance for this system is on CoNLL-2011, we compare against the publicly available system using the SURFACE model, which doesn't use features induced from English Gigaword (Graff et al., 2007).",
        "Chang et al. (2013)'s L 3 M systems comprise both mention-pair and cluster-based variants; we focus on the former here since these perform better on OntoNotes 5.",
        "L 3 M represents a maximum-margin approach to ranking models, where CL 3 M adds some cluster modelling via a constraint term.",
        "5.1 Performance Table 1 presents our performance on DEV and TEST.",
        "Our core LIMERIC system includes all features described in Section 4 including our novel discourse features Discourse patterns, Discourse likelihood, and Stack depth.",
        "In development, we experiment with system configurations by deactivating semantic features (-s) and activating stack competition features (+c) in turn.",
        "Despite a good CEAFE score, we opt not to include stack competition features in our final system.",
        "Given the simplicity of our learning and decoding, our system compares favourably with existing systems.",
        "In all configurations, we beat both publicly available systems and the mention-pair variant L 3 M: by uniting aspects of ranking- and cluster-based approaches, we achieve benefits beyond either in 3 since distinct feature strings correspond to completely distinct features 4 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml 5 http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/berkeleycoref.shtml 2134 System MUC B 3 CEAFE CoNLL Stanford 64.30 70.46 46.35 60.37 Berkeley 66.10 68.56 50.09 61.58 L 3 M 67.88 71.88 47.16 62.30 CL 3 M 69.20 72.89 48.67 63.59 LIMERIC 71.02 68.66 50.31 63.33 LIMERIC +c 70.67 68.33 50.55 63.18 LIMERIC -s 70.53 68.21 50.34 63.03 System MUC B 3 CEAFE CoNLL Stanford 63.83 68.52 45.36 59.23 Berkeley 69.09 65.89 48.26 61.08 L 3 M 68.31 70.81 46.73 61.95 CL 3 M 69.64 71.93 48.32 63.30 LIMERIC 71.52 67.47 49.75 62.91 Table 1: CoNLL-2012 DEV (left) and TEST (right) isolation.",
        "Also, we consistently outperform CL 3 M on two of the three performance metrics; our method for uniting existing approaches is more direct and psycholinguistically faithful than that in CL 3 M and our competitive system results are promising for future work.",
        "Our system's MUC and CEAFE scores are the highest across all systems on both datasets.",
        "Our high CEAFE score in particular suggests that our system produces an accurate number of clusters.",
        "We explore this further in Figure 4 using the tool described in Kummerfeld and Klein (2013) 6 .",
        "Between Berkeley and LIMERIC, the notable difference is that we make considerably fewer Divided Entity and Missed Entity errors for a small increase in Conflated Entity errors.",
        "By introducing features which model when a new discourse entity should form and how the relative accessibility of already active ones impacts coreference decisions, we more accurately predict the bounds of entity clusters.",
        "This modelling is independent of surface features: 85% and 96% of Berkeley's Divided Entity errors occur where there is no head match and string match between mentions, respectively, compared to our values of 87% and 96%.",
        "We note also that, given Kummerfeld and Klein's finding that MUC recall is highly sensitive to Divided Entity errors and B 3 precision to Conflated Entity errors, we can understand our performance on these metrics, particularly if our errors occur in larger clusters.",
        "Between LIMERIC and LIMERIC+c, the notable difference is that LIMERIC+c makes fewer Missed Mention errors, but at a high cost to Extra Entity errors.",

        "The vast majority of correct merge targets are near the top of the stack, with 78% up to depth 10 and 88% up to depth 20.",
        "Setting maximum search depth to 60 yields a model which scores 61.31 on DEV.",
        "While this outperforms Stanford and is competitive with Berkeley, the magnitude of loss is surprising given the distribution in Figure 5.",
        "Error analysis shows an increased number of Conflated Entity and Extra Mention errors, which were shown in Kummerfeld and Klein (2013) to have a substantial precision cost.",
        "We note that this is consistent with our system having good accuracy in predicting whether or not a new entity cluster should form, but being restricted to choose an incorrect merge target when the correct one is outside its search window.",

        "Our final system uses a maximum beam size of 10 with a conservative threshold of 5 for new stack formation.",
        "We find little difference between using classification score or stack discourse likelihood as our pruning metric.",
        "The results in Table 3 indicate that beam search isn't essential for state of the art performance in our system, our rich feature set is adequate alone.",
        "If we limit the beam to a single stack, we still have competitive performance with CL 3 M. Indeed, if we do not set a strict threshold on the score at which a new stack is formed, we are forced to maintain the maximum 10 stacks and this actually hurts performance.",
        "These findings are consistent with those in Zhang and Nivre (2012), which demonstrates that performance gains are only seen from beam search at run time when their shift-reduce parser was trained similarly, maintaining a beam of potentially incorrect predictions and learning to recover as well as possible from unfavourable states.",
        "7 Conclusion The primary contribution of our work is a reconceptualisation of coreference by analogy with the shift-reduce parsing algorithm.",
        "We present LIMERIC, a simple, low memory coreference resolution system which achieves the competitive CoNLL scores of 63.33 and 62.91 on the CoNLL-2012 DEV and TEST splits of OntoNotes 5.",
        "Our framework unites ranking- and cluster-based approximations to global consistency encoding, and we outperform systems using either in isolation.",
        "By interpreting the stack of incrementally growing entity clusters in our system as a reader's mental status while reading, we naturally extend the shift-reduce algorithm to express a series of rich discourse features which perform well in feature analysis.",
        "Our results demonstrate the promise of psycholinguistic insights for coreference resolution and future directions include further extension of our discourse, as well as semantic, model.",
        "We plan future work in enriching our training process with beam search, and incorporating more insights from Centering and Accessibility Theories.",
