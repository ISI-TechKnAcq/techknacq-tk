      "text": [
        "Documents are usually comprised of topically coherent text segments, each of which contains some number of text passages (e.g., sentences or paragraphs) (Salton et al., 1996).",
        "Within each topically coherent segment, one would expect that the word usage demonstrates more consistent lexical distributions (known as lexical cohesion (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)) than that across segments.",
        "A linear partition of texts into topic segments may reveal information about, for example, themes of segments and the overall thematic structure of the text, and can subsequently be useful for text analysis tasks, such as information retrieval (e.g., passage retrieval (Salton et al., 1996)), document summarisation and discourse analysis (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper we consider how to automatically find a topic segmentation.",
        "It involves identifying the most prominent topic changes in a sequence of text passages, and splits those passages into a sequence of topically coherent segments (Hearst, 1997; Beeferman et al., 1999).",
        "This task can be cast as an unsupervised machine learning problem: placing topic boundaries in unannotated text.",
        "Although a variety of cues in text can be used for topic segmentation, such as cue phases (Beeferman et al., 1999; Reynar, 1999; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)) and discourse information (Galley et al., 2003), in this paper, we focus on lexical cohesion and use it as the primary cue in developing an unsupervised segmentation model.",
        "The effectiveness of lexical cohesion has been demonstrated by Text-Tiling (Hearst, 1997), c99 (Choi, 2000), MinCut (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), PLDA (Purver et al., 2006), Bayesseg (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), TopicTiling (Riedl and Biemann, 2012), etc.",
        "Our work uses recent progress in hierarchical topic modelling with non-parametric Bayesian methods (Du et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Du et al., 2012a), and is based on Bayesian segmentation methods (Goldwater et al., 2009; Purver et al., 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) using topic models.",
        "This can also be viewed as a multi-topic extension of hierarchical Bayesian segmentation (Eisenstein, 2009), although our use of hierarchies is used to improve the performance of linear segmentation, rather than develop hierarchical segmentation.",
        "Recently, topic models are increasingly used in various text analysis tasks including topic segmentation.",
        "Previous work (Purver et al., 2006; Misra et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Misra et al., 2009; Riedl and Biemann, 2012) has shown that using",
        "topic assignments or topic distributions instead of word frequency can significantly improve segmentation performance.",
        "Here we consider more advanced topic models that model dependencies between (sub-)sections in a document, such as structured topic models (STMs) presented in (Du et al., 2010; Du et al., 2012b).",
        "STMs treat each text as a sequence of segments, each of which is a set of text passages (e.g., a paragraph or sentence).",
        "Text passages in a segment share the same prior distribution on their topics.",
        "The topic distributions of segments in a single document are then encouraged to be similar via a hierarchical prior.",
        "This gives a substantial improvement in modelling accuracy.",
        "However, instead of explicitly learning the segmentation, STMs just leverage the existing structure of documents from the given segmentation.",
        "Given a sequence of text passages, how can we automatically learn the segmentation?",
        "The word boundary sampling algorithm introduced in (Goldwater et al., 2009) uses point-wise sampling of word boundaries after phonemes in an utterance.",
        "Similarly, the segmentation method of PLDA (Purver et al., 2006) samples segment boundaries, but also jointly samples a topic model.",
        "This is different to other topic modelling approaches that run LDA as a precursor to a separate segmentation step (Misra et al., 2009; Riedl and Biemann, 2012).",
        "While conceptually similar to PLDA, our non-parametric approach built on STM required new methods to implement, but the resulting improvement by the standard segmentation scores is substantial.",
        "This paper presents a new hierarchical Bayesian unsupervised topic segmentation model, integrating a point-wise boundary sampling algorithm with a structured topic model.",
        "This new model takes advantage of the high modelling accuracy of structured topic models (Du et al., 2010) to produce a topic segmentation based on the distribution of latent topics.",
        "We show that this model provides high quality segmentation performance on Choi's dataset, as well as two sets of meeting transcripts and written texts.",
        "In the following sections we describe our topic segmentation model and an MCMC inference algorithm for the non-parametric split/merge process.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review recent related work in the topic segmentation literature.",
        "Section 3 presents the new topic segmentation model, followed by the derivation of a sampling algorithm in Section 4.",
        "We report the experimental results by comparing several related topic segmentation methods in Section 5.",

        "We are interested in unsupervised topic segmentation in either written or spoken language.",

        "One branch of this work represents the lexical cohesion in a vector space by exploring the word co-occurrence patterns, e.g., TF or TF-IDF.",
        "Work following this line includes TextTiling (Hearst, 1997), which calculates the cosine similarity between two adjacent blocks of words purely based on the word frequency; C99 (Choi, 2000), an algorithm based on divisive clustering with a matrix-ranking scheme; LSeg (Galley et al., 2003), which uses a lexical chain to identify and weight word repetitions; U00 (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), a probalistic approach using dynamic programming to find a segmentation with a minimum cost; MinCut (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), which casts segmentation as a graph cut problem, and APS (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2011), which uses affinity propagation to learn clustering for segmentation.",
        "The other branch of this work characterises the lexical cohesion using topic models, to which the model introduced in Section 3 belongs.",
        "Lexical cohesion in this line of research is modelled by a probabilistic generative process.",
        "PLDA presented by Purver et al. (2006) is an unsupervised topic modelling approach for segmentation.",
        "It chains a set of LDAs (Blei et al., 2003) by assuming a Markov structure on topic distributions.",
        "A binary topic shift variable is attached to each text passage (i.e., an utterance in (Purver et al., 2006)).",
        "It is sampled to indicate whether the jth text passage shares the topic distribution with the (j ?",
        "1)th passage.",
        "Using a similar Markov structure, SITS (Nguyen et al., 2012) chains a set of HDP-LDAs (Teh et al., 2006).",
        "Unlike PLDA, SITS assumes each text passage is associated with a speaker identity that is attached to the topic shift variable as supervising in",
        "formation.",
        "SITS further assumes speakers have different topic change probabilities that work as priors on topic shift variables.",
        "Instead of assuming documents in a dataset share the same set of topics, Bayesseg (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) treats words in a segment generated from a segment specific multinomial language model, i.e., it assumes each segment is generated from one topic, and a later hierarchical extension (Eisenstein, 2009) assumes each segment is generated from one topic or its parents.",
        "Other methods using as input the output of topic models include (Sun et al., 2008), (Misra et al., 2009), and (Riedl and Biemann, 2012).",
        "In this paper we take a generative approach lying between PLDA and SITS.",
        "In contrast to PLDA, which uses a flat topic model (i.e., LDA), we assume each text has a latent topic structure that can reflect the topic coherence pattern, and the model adapts its parameters to the segments to further improve performance.",
        "Unlike SITS that targets analysing multi-party meeting transcripts, where speaker identities are available, we are interested in more general texts and assume each text has a specific topic change probability, since (1) the identity information is not always available for all kinds of texts (e.g., continuous broadcast news transcripts (Allan et al., 1998)), (2) even for the same author, topic change probabilities for his/her different articles might be different."
