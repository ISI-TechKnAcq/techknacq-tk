        "For the generation process we have defined 3 different experiments: Based on a strophe from the corpora, we (a) replace each word with other according to its POS-tag and suffixes, (b) replace each noun and adjective with another equally inflected word and (c) replace only nouns with semantically related ones (inflected).",
        "Finally we evaluate those strategies using a Turing Test-like evaluation."

        "The presented method is not tied to a specific language, but it is especially suitable for inflected languages, as the POS information used in some tasks with success in non inflected languages is not enough for inflected ones.",
        "We have used the POS-tags with their inflectional information to learn usual structures in Basque poetry.",
        "This work is part of a more general and complete project, called BertsoBOT (Astigarraga et al., 2013).",
        "BertsoBOT is a robot capable of creating and singing Basque verses automatically.",
        "The robot joins together in a single system techniques from robotics, NLP and speech synthesis and recognition.",
        "The work presented in this paper comes to improve the generation module of the mentioned system.",

        "Although there is a standardized form of the language, it is common the use of non-standard dialects in certain regions, mainly in spoken language.",
        "Basque is a morphologically rich language, which is an obvious feature if we analyze the multiple declension cases2 that can be usedwith only oneword.",

        "The performances of verse-makers are quite usual and a big championship is held every four years which congregates 15.000 people, approximately.",
        "One tipical work to do for the verse-makers is to sing verses extempore, given a topic.",
        "The particularity of these verses is that they have to follow strict constraints of meter and rhyme.",
