        "One of the typical problems of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the explosive property of the parser and this is aggravated in an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) because the grammar is unconstrained and admits even more analyses.",
        "NLP applications frequently incorporate techniques for selecting a preferred parse.",
        "Computational criteria, however, are insufficient for a pedagogic system because the parse chosen will possibly result in misleading feedback for the learner.",
        "Preferably, the analysis emphasizes language teaching pedagogy by selecting the sentence interpretation a student most likely intended.",

        "One of the fundamental problems of any Natural Language Processing (NLP) system is the often overwhelming number of interpretations a phrase or sentence can be assigned.",
        "For example, van Noord (1997) states that the Alvey Tools Grammar with 780 rules averages about 100 readings per sentence on sentences ranging in length between 13 and 30 words.",
        "The problem is not always improved with deeper analysis, for though a semantic analysis may rule some of the possible syntactic structures, it will introduce lexical and scope ambiguity.",
        "The problem of resolving multiple interpretations is compounded in an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) because the grammar must not only admit grammatical structures, but must also be able to navigate over ungrammatical structures and record the errors that the student has made.",
        "As a consequence, a grammar for an ILTS will not only assign structures to a grammatical sentence, but may also find analyses which interpret the sentence as ungrammatical, a set of analyses that a traditionally constrained grammar would not find.",
        "The usual method of limiting the number of parses that an ILTS grammar assigns is to examine the effects of relaxing those constraints that represent likely sources of error by students and introduce new constraints into the grammar rules to block unlikely parses (Schneider & McCoy 1998).",
        "Such techniques, however, overlook individual learner differences as a key factor in language teaching pedagogy.",
        "The system introduced in this paper differs from the traditional approach by permitting the grammar to freely generate as many parses as it can and using separate pedagogic principles to select the appropriate interpretation and response.",
        "The system tightly integrates the Student Model into the process of selecting the appropriate interpretation and generating a response tailored to the student's level of expertise.",
        "The Student Model keeps a record of students' performance history which provides information essential to the analysis of multiple parses, multiple errors, and the level of interaction with the student.",
        "In the German Tutor, the ILTS described, the process leading to the creation of an instructional message in the event of an error has",
        "three stages: (1) Given a forest of parse trees created by the grammar and parser, the parse most likely representative of the intentions of the student must be selected; (2) In the cases when the parse representing a student's intentions contains several errors, one of the error must be selected as the one that will be addressed.",
        "This step is necessary because empirical studies have found that reporting all the errors in a sentence is pedagogically inappropriate.",
        "For example, in evaluating her own system Schwind (1990) reports that Islometimes, however, the explanations were too long, especially when students accumulated errors.\"1; (3) Given an error, an instructional message must be constructed that is appropriate to the student's level of expertise and background.",
        "In Section 1, the theory behind the grammar and its formalism is briefly discussed.",
        "Section 2 describes the process leading to the selection of a particular parse and how the Student Model participates in this process.",
        "We further discuss the pedagogic role of the Student Model in handling multiple errors and deciding on the level of interaction with the student.",
        "Section 3 presents conclusions and Section 4 looks at further research."

        "Theories in this family are to varying degrees lexicalist, that is, a considerable amount of grammatical information is located in the lexicon rather than in the grammar rules.",
        "For example, Figure 1 illustrates a minimal lexical entry for geht.",
        "The subcategorization list of the verb, notated with the feature subj, specifies that geht takes a subject which is minimally specified as a singular noun.",
        "Rules of grammar specify how words and phrases are combined into larger units according to the subcategorization list.",
        "In addition, other principles govern how information such as the head features, which inter alia determine the grammatical category of a constituent, is inherited.2",
        "Unification-based grammars place an important restriction on unification, namely that two categories A and B fail to unify if they contain mutually inconsistent information (Gazdar & Pullum 1985).",
        "However, this inconsistent information constitutes exactly the errors made by second language learners.",
        "For example, if the two categories A and B do not agree in number a parse will fail.",
        "To overcome this restriction, we relax the constraint on number agreement by changing its structure so that, rather than checking that the noun is singular, the system records whether or not the subject of geht is in the singular.",
