      "text": [
        "With continuously increasing amounts of images available on the Web and elsewhere, it is important to find methods to annotate and organize image databases in meaningful ways.",
        "Tagging images with words describing their content can contribute to faster and more effective image search and classification.",
        "In fact, a large number of applications, including the image search feature of current search engines (e.g., Yahoo!, Google) or the various sites providing picture storage services (e.g., Flickr, Picasa) rely exclusively on the tags associated with an image in order to search for relevant images for a given query.",
        "However, the task of developing accurate and robust automatic image annotation models entails daunting challenges.",
        "First, the availability oflarge and correctly annotated image databases is crucial for the training and testing of new annotation models.",
        "Although a number of image databases have emerged to serve as evaluation benchmarks for different applications, including image annotation (Duygulu et al., 2002), content-based image retrieval (Li and Wang, 2008) and cross language information retrieval (Grubinger et al., 2006), such databases are almost exclusively created by manual labeling of keywords, requiring significant human effort and time.",
        "The content of these image databases is often restricted only to a few domains, such as medical and natural photo scenes (Grubinger et al., 2006), and specific objects like cars, airplanes, or buildings (Fergus et al., 2003).",
        "For obvious practical reasons, it is important to develop models trained and evaluated on more realistic and diverse image collections.",
        "The second challenge concerns the extraction of useful image and text features for the construction of reliable annotation models.",
        "Most traditional approaches relied on the extraction ofimage colors and textures (Li and Wang, 2008), or the identification of similar image regions clustered as blobs (Duygulu et al., 2002) to derive correlations between image features and annotation keywords.",
        "In comparison, there are only a few efforts that leverage on the multitude of resources available for natural language processing to derive robust linguistic-based image annotation models.",
        "One of the earliest efforts involved the use of captions for face recognition in photographs through the construction of a specific lexicon that integrates linguistic and photographic information (Srihari and Burhans, 1994).",
        "More recently, several approaches have proposed the use of WordNet as a knowledge-base to improve content-based image annotation models, either by removing noisy keywords through semantic clustering (Jin et al., 2005) or by inducing a hierarchical classification of candidate labels (Srikanth et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we explore the use ofseveral natural language resources to construct image annotation models that are capable of automatically tagging images from unrestricted domains with good accuracy.",
        "Unlike traditional image annotation methodologies that generate tags using image-based features, we propose to extract them in a manner analogous to keyword extraction.",
        "Given a target image and its surrounding text, we extract those words and phrases that are most likely to represent meaningful tags.",
        "More importantly, we are interested to investigate the potential of such linguistic-based models on image annotation accuracy and reliability.",
        "Our work is motivated by the need for annotation models that can be efficiently applied on a very large scale (e.g. harvesting images from the web), which are required in applications that cannot afford the complexity and time associated with current image processing techniques.",
        "The paper makes the following contributions.",
        "We first propose a new evaluation framework for image tagging, which is based on an analogy drawn between the tasks of image labeling and lexical substitution.",
        "Next, we present three extractive approaches for the task of image annotation.",
        "The methods proposed are based only on the text surrounding an image, without the use of image features.",
        "Finally, by combining several orthogonal methods through machine learning, we show that it is possible to achieve a performance that is competitive to a state-of-the-art image annotation system that relies on visual and textual features, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based extractive annotation models."

        "Several online systems have sprung into existence to achieve annotation of real world images through human collaborative efforts (Flickr) and stimulating competition (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004).",
        "Although a large number of image tags can be generated in short time, these approaches depend on the availability of human annotators and are far from being automatic.",
        "Similarly, research in the other direction via text-to-image synthesis halcea and Leong, 2009) has also helped to harvest images, mostly for concrete words, by refining image search engines.",
        "Most approaches to automatic image annotation have focused on the generation of image labels using annotation models trained with image features and human annotated keywords (Barnard and Forsyth, 2001; Jeon et al., 2003; Makadia et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Instead of predicting specific words, these methods generally target the generation of semantic classes (e.g. vegetation, animal, building, places etc), which they can achieve with a reasonable amount of success.",

        "As the methods we propose are extractive, standard image databases with no surrounding text such as Corel (Duygulu et al., 2002) are not suitable, nor are they representative for the challenges associated with raw data from unrestricted domains.",
        "We thus create our own dataset using images randomly extracted from the Web.",
        "To avoid sparse searches, we use a list of the most frequent words in the British National Corpus as seed words, and query the web using the Google Image API.",
        "A webpage is randomly selected from the query results if it contains a single image in the specified size range (width and height of 275 to 1000 pixels) and its text contains more than 10 words.",
        "Next, we use a Document Object Model (DOM) HTML parser to extract the content of the webpage.",
        "Note that we do not perform manual filtering of our images except where they contain undesirable qualities (e.g. porn, corrupted or blank images).",
        "In total, we collected 300 image-text pairs from the web.",
        "The average image size is 496 pixels width and 461 pixels height.",
        "The average text length is 278 tokens and the average document title length is 6 tokens.",
        "In total, there are 83,522 words and the total vocabulary is 8,409 words.",
        "For each image, we also create a gold standard of manually assigned tags, by using the labels assigned by five human annotators.",
        "The image annotation is conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk, which was shown in the past to produce reliable annotations (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "For increased annotation reliability, we only accept annotators with an approval rating of 98%.",
        "Given an image, an annotator extracts from the associated text a minimum of five words or collocations.Annotators can choose words freely from the text, while collocation candidates are restricted to a fixed set obtained from the n-grams (n < 7) in the text that also appear as article names or surface forms in Wikipedia.",
        "Moreover, when interpreting the image, the annotators are instructed to focus on both the denotational and conotational attributes present in the image.",
        "Normal Image | Mode Image",
        "Table 1 : Two sample images.",
        "The number besides each label indicates the number of human annotators agreeing on that label.",
        "Note that the mode image has a tag (i.e.\"train\") in the gold standard set most frequently selected by the annotators",
        "4 A New Evaluation Framework : Image Tagging as Lexical Substitution",
        "While evaluations of previous work in image annotation were often based on labels provided with the images, such as tags or image captions, in our dataset such annotations are either missing or unreliable.",
        "We rely instead on human-produced extractive annotations (as described in the previous section), and formulate a new evaluation framework based on the intuition that an image can be substituted with one or more tags that convey the same meaning as the image itself.",
        "Ideally, there is a single tag that \"best\" describes the image overall (i.e. the gold standard tag agreed by the majority of human annotators), but there are also multiple tags that describe the fine-grained concepts present in the image.",
        "Our evaluation framework is inspired by the lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), where a system attempts to generate a word (or a set of words) to replace a target word, such that the meaning of the sentence is preserved.",
        "Given this analogy, the evaluation metrics used for lexical substitution can be adapted to the evaluation of image tagging.",
        "Specifically, we measure the precision and the recall of a tagging method using four subtasks: best normal: provides precision and recall for the top-ranked tag returned by a method; best mode: provides precision and recall only if the top-ranked tag by a method matches the tag in the gold standard that was most frequently selected by the annotators; out of ten (oot) nor-",

        "We also compare our work against (Feng and Lapata, 2008) as it allows for a direct comparison with models using both image and textual features under a standard evaluation framework.",
        "We obtained the BBC dataset used in their experiments, which consists of 3121 training and 240 testing images.",
        "In this dataset, images are implicitly tagged with captions by the author of the corresponding BBC article.",
        "The evaluations are run against these captions.",
        "In their experiments, Feng and Lapata created four annotation models.",
        "The first two (tf*idf and Document Title) are the same as used in our baseline experiments.",
        "The third model (Lavrenko03) is an application of the continuous relevance model in (Jeon et al., 2003), trained with the BBC image features and captions.",
        "Finally, the forth (ExtModel) is an extension ofthe relevance model using additional information in auxiliary texts.",
        "Briefly, the model assumes a multiple Bernoulli distribution for words in a caption, and generates tags for a test image using a weighted combination of the accompanying document, caption and image features learned during training.",

        "The experimental setup is similar to the earlier section, but a few modifications are made for a fair and direct comparison.",
        "First, we extend our models coverage to include content words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives) determined using the Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "Second, no collocations are used.",
        "Third, we adopt the evaluation framework used by Feng and Lapata to extract the top 10, 15 and 20 tags.",
        "Note that in our methods, the extraction of tags for a test image is only done on the document surrounding the image, after excluding the caption.",
        "As the number of negative examples (words not present in the caption) greatly outnumber the positive instances, we employ an under-sampling method (Kubat and Matwin, 1997) to balance the dataset for training.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "Interestingly, all our unsupervised extraction-based models perform consistently above the supervised Lavrenko03 model, indicating that textual features are more informative than captions and image features taken together.",
        "Comparing with models using significantly less document information (tf*idf and Doc title), our models gain even greater advantage.",
        "Note that the title of any BBC article does not exceed 10 words, hence comparison is only meaningful given the top 10 tags retrieved.",
        "Feng and Lapata used LDA to perform rerank-ing of final candidates in their ExtModel.",
        "However, when used as a model alone, the PAM topic model achieved promising scores in all the categories, performing best for top 10 keywords (F1 of 14.91%).",
        "Flickr picturability stands out as the best performing unsupervised method, scoring the highest precision (12.13%, top 10), recall (29.80%, top 20) and F1 (15.84%, top 10).",
        "Overall, this comparative evaluation yields some important insights.",
        "First, our combined model using SVM is statistically better (p<0.1 for top 10, 15, 20) than the Laverenko03 model, but not statistically different from the ExtModel.",
        "This demonstrates the effectiveness of textual-based models over traditional models trained with image features and captions.",
        "While it is intuitively clear that image features help in improving tagging performance, we show that mining only the text surrounding an image, where it exists, can yield a performance that is comparable to a state-of-the-art system that uses both textual and visual features.",
        "Moreover, an increase in complexity of a model by using more features may hinder its applicability to large datasets, but not necessarily improving annotation performance (Maka-dia et al., 2008).",
        "On this, text-based annotation models can provide a desirable compromise.",
        "For instance, our unsupervised models implementing Flickr picturability and Wikipedia Salience are able to extract annotations from a BBC article (average 133.85 tokens) in approximately 1 second and 20 seconds respectively."

        "In this paper, we introduced several text-based extractive approaches for automatic image annotation and showed that they compare favorably with the state-of-the-art in image annotation using both text and image features.",
        "We believe our work has practical applications in mining and annotating images over the Web, where texts are naturally associated with images, and scalability is important.",
        "Our next direction seeks to derive robust annotation models using additional ontological knowledge-bases.",
        "We would also like to advance the the state-of-the-art by augmenting current textual models with image features."
