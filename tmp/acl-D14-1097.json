        "Today, the state-of-the-art methods in most natural language processing tasks are supervised machine learning approaches.",
        "Their main problem lies in their need of large human-annotated training corpus, which requires a tedious and expensive work from domain experts.",
        "The process of active learning (AL) employs one or more human annotators by asking them to label new samples which are supposed to be the most informative in the creation of a new classifier.",
        "A classifier is incrementally retrained with all the data labeled by the annotator.",
        "AL has been demonstrated to work well and to produce accurate classifiers while saving much human annotation effort.",
        "One critical issue is to define a measure of the informativeness which should reflect how much new information a new example would give in the learning of a new classifier once annotated.",
        "A lot of work has been done on the AL field in the past years (see (Settles, 2012) for an exhaustive overview).",
        "In particular, AL proved its usefulness in sequence labeling tasks (Settles and Craven, 2008).",
        "Yet, researchers have always adopted as annotation unit an entire sequence (i.e., the annotator is asked to annotate the whole sequence) while it looks like it could be much more relevant to ask for labeling only small parts of it (e.g., the ones with highest ambiguity).",
        "A few works have investigated this idea.",
        "For instance, Wanvarie et al. (2011) proposed to use Partially-Labeled Conditional Random Fields (PL-CRFs) (Tsuboi et al., 2008), a semi-supervised variation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) able to deal with partially-labeled sequences, thus enabling to adopt as annotation unit single tokens and still learning from full sequences.",
        "AL with partially labeled sequences has proven to be effective in substantially reducing the amount of annotated data with respect to common AL approaches (see (Wanvarie et al., 2011)).",
        "In this work we focus on AL strategies for partially labeled sequences adopting the single token as annotation unit and PL-CRFs as learning algorithm given its nature in dealing with partially labeled sequences.",
        "We propose several AL strategies based on measures of uncertainty adapted for the AL with partially labeled sequences scenario and tailored on PL-CRFs.",
        "We further propose two strategies that exploit the finer granularity given by the partially-labeled scenario.",
        "We also show that the choice of single-token annotation can bring to unpredictable results on sequence labeling tasks in which the structure of the sequences is not regular, e.g., named-entity recognition.",
        "We propose a first solution to the problem of unpredictability.",
        "The aim of this work is thoroughly compare the effectiveness and the behavior of all the proposed AL strategies on four standard sequence labeling tasks, phrase chunking, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition and bio-entity recognition.",
        "The remainder of this paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we summarize the related work in AL, in Section 3 we describe PL-CRFs, the semi-supervised algorithm we adopt in this work.",
        "Section 4 describes in details the AL framework and the AL strategies we propose.",
        "Section 5 provides a description of the experimental setting, the datasets, and discusses the empirical results.",
        "Section 6 summarizes our findings.",
        "2 Related Work Our work belongs to the pool-based AL framework.",
        "It considers the case in which a large amount (pool) of unlabeled examples is available, from which samples to be labeled must be chosen.",
        "This framework fits all the sequence labeling problems we consider here.",
        "For a more exhaustive survey on other AL frameworks see 898 (Settles, 2012).",
        "Most of the AL works on sequence labeling adopted the entire sequence as annotation unit (Settles and Craven, 2008) which was demonstrated by Wanvarie et al. (2011) to be less effective than using the single token as annotation unit.",
        "The main AL works in this latter line of work are (Shen et al., 2004), (Tomanek and Hahn, 2009) and (Wanvarie et al., 2011).",
        "Shen et al. (2004) adopted SVMs as learning algorithm and proposed two strategies that combine three criteria, in-formativeness, representativeness and diversity.",
        "SVMs allowed them to use as annotation unit a subset of the tokens in a sequence, without annotating, in any way, the rest of the tokens in the sequence.",
        "In (Tomanek and Hahn, 2009), the most uncertain tokens of the sequence are singularly annotated, but the rest of the labels in the sequence are then chosen by the classifier in a semi-supervised fashion.",
        "Wanvarie et al. (2011) is the closest work to ours, they adopt a minimum confidence selection strategy with re-estimation using the PL-CRFs.",
        "Differently from our work, Wanvarie et al. (2011) show that adopting the AL with partially labeled sequences using re-estimation, the annotation cost can be dramatically reduced (by annotating from 8% to 10% of the tokens of the entire training set), obtaining the same level of performance of the classifier trained on the en-tire, fully-labeled, training set.",
        "We started our work from this conclusion and we focused on AL with partially labeled sequences using re-estimation by comparing several AL strategies in order to find the strategy that allows to create the best classifier with the minimum annotation effort.",

        "The Minimum Token Margin (MTM) strategy is a variant of the margin sampling strategy introduced in (Scheffer et al., 2001).",

        "The rationale is that, with these strategies, the measure of uncertainty is chosen according to the information obtained from the outcome of the Viterbi algorithm (i.e., the most probable sequence assignment).",
        "The Minimum Viterbi Probability (MVP) is the base strategy adopted in (Wanvarie et al., 2011).",

        "For each dataset we adopted a standard set of features.",

        "As evaluation measure we adopted the token variant of the F 1 measure, introduced by Esuli and Sebastiani (2010).",
        "This variant, instead of the entire annotation (chunk/entity), calculates TP s, FP s, and FNs, singularly for each token that compose the annotation, bringing to a finer evaluation.",
        "5.3 Results From the learning curves of Figure 1 and Figure 2 it is clear that most of the strategies have the same trend throughout the different datasets.",
        "This results is somewhat different from the results obtained in (Settles and Craven, 2008) in which there is not a clear winner among the strategies they proposed in a fully-labeled scenario.",
        "The strategies that perform particularly bad (worse than the RAND strategy in CoNLL2000POS and in CoNLL2003 dataset) in all the datasets are the MTE and MTP.",
        "This is expected, because the choice of the measure of informativeness related to the token without taking in consideration the Viterbi path is suboptimal in this task.",
        "Surprisingly, the MTM strategy even though based on the same principle of MTE and MTP, is very effective in most of the datasets.",
        "The most effective strategies, that is, the ones that are the faster at helping the classifier to reach a better accuracy are the MTM, MVM, and MVP, in particular the margin-based strategies perform very good in all the 902 Table 1: Training Data Statistics.",
