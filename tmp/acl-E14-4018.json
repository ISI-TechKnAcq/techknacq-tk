        "Since their introduction at the beginning of the twenty-first century, phrase-based (PB) translation models (Koehn et al., 2003) have become the state-of-the-art for statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "PB model provide a big leap in translation quality with respect to the previous word-based translation models (Brown et al., 1990; Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "However, despite their empirical suc-cess, inference procedures for PB models rely on a long pipeline of heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003) and mismatched learning models, such as the long outperformed word-based models.",
        "Latter stages of the pipeline cannot recover mistakes or omissions made in earlier stages which forces the individual stages to massively overgenerate hypotheses.",
        "This manifests as a huge redundancy in the inferred phrase lexicons, which in turn largely penalizes the efficiency of PB systems at run-time.",
        "The fact that PB models usually cannot generate the sentence pairs in which they have been trained in, or that it is even possible to improve the performance of a PB system by discarding most of the learned phrases are clear indicators of these deficiencies (Sanchis-Trilles et al., 2011).",
        "We introduce an unsupervised procedure to infer PB models based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Solomonoff, 1964; Rissanen, 1978).",
        "MDL, formally described in Section 2, is a general inference procedure that ?learns?",
        "by ?finding data regularities?.",
        "MDL takes its name from the fact that regularities allow to compress the data, i.e. to describe it using fewer symbols than those required to describe the data literally.",
        "As such, MDL embodies a form of Oc-cam's Razor in which the best model for a given data is the one that provides a better trade-off between goodness-of-fit on the data and ?complex- ity?",
        "or ?richness?",
        "of the model.",
        "MDL has been previously used to infer monolingual grammars (Gr?unwald, 1996) and inversion transduction grammars (Saers et al., 2013).",
        "Here, we adapt the basic principles described in the latter article to the inference of PB models.",
        "The MDL inference procedure, described in Section 3, learns PB models by iteratively generalizing an initial model that perfectly overfits training data.",
        "An MDL objective is used to guide this process.",
        "MDL inference has the following desirable prop-erties: ?",
        "Training and testing are optimized upon the same model; a basic principle of machine learning largely ignored in PB models.",
        "?",
        "It provides a joint estimation of the structure (set of bilingual phrases) and the parameters (phrase probabilities) of PB models.",
        "?",
        "It automatically protects against overfitting by implementing a trade-off between the expressiveness of the model and training data fitting.",
        "The empirical evaluation described in Section 4 focuses on understanding the behavior of MDL-based PB models and their specific traits.",
        "That is, in contrast to a typical PB system building pa-per, we are not exclusively focused on a short term boost in translation quality.",
        "Instead, we aim at studying the adequacy and future potential of MDL as inference procedure for PB models.",
        "90 2 The MDL Principle Given a set of data D, the MDL principle aims at obtaining the simplest possible model ?",
        "that describes D as well as possible (Solomonoff, 1964; Rissanen, 1978).",
        "Central to MDL is the one-to-one correspondence between description length functions and probability distributions that follows from the Kraft-McMillan inequality (McMillan, 1956).",
        "For any probability distribution Pr(?",
        "), it is possible to construct a coding scheme such that the length (in bits) of the encoded data is minimum and equal to?",
        "log 2 (Pr(D)).",
        "In other words, searching for a minimum description length reduces to searching for a good probability distribu-tion, and vice versa.",

        "= argmin ?",
        "DL(?,D) (1) = argmin ?",
        "DL(?)",
        "+ DL(D | ?)",
        "(2) where DL(?)",
        "denotes the description length of the model, and DL(D | ?)",
        "denotes the description length of the data given the model.",
        "A complete introductory tutorial of the MDL principle and methods can be found in (Gr?unwald, 2004).",
        "3 MDL Phrase-Based Models 3.1 Description Length Functions We start by defining how to compute DL(?)",
        "and DL(D | ?)",
        "for any PB model and data set.",

        "= ?",
        "log 2 (Pr ?",
        "(D)), which it is the lower bound for the description length of the data.",
        "Regarding the description length of the PB model, DL(?",
        "), we compute it by serializing ?",
        "into a sequence of symbols and then computing the length of the optimal encoding of such sequence.",
        "To do that, we need one symbol for each word in the source and target languages, another symbol to separate the source and target sides in a phrase pair, and one additional symbol to distinguish between the different pairs in the phrase lexicon.",
        "For example, the following toy PB model La|||The casa|||house azul|||blue is serialized as La|The?casa|house?azul|blue, where symbol ?",
        "separates the phrase pairs, and | separates the two sides of each pair.",
        "Assuming a uniform distribution over the K different symbols, each symbol would require ?",
        "log 2 ( 1 K ) bits to encode.",
        "We will thus require 3 bits to encode each of the 8 symbols in the example, and 33 bits to encode the whole serialized PB model (11 symbols).",
        "3.2 Inference Procedure We now describe how to perform the maximization in Equation (2).",
        "In the case of PB models, this reduces to a search for the optimal phrase lexicon.",
        "Obviously, an exhaustive search over all possible sets of phrase pairs in the data is unfeasible in practice.",
        "Following the ideas in (Vilar and Vi-dal, 2005), we implement a search procedure that iteratively generalizes an initial PB model that perfectly fits the data.",
        "Let D = {f n , e n } N n=1 be a data set with N sentence pairs, where f n are sentences in the source language and e n are their corresponding translation in the target language.",

        "?",
        "f N ||| e N where the probability of each pair is given by the number of occurrences of the pair in the data divided by the number of occurrences of the source (or target) language sentence.",
        "To generalize this initial PB model, we need to identify parts of the existing phrase pairs that could be validly used in isolation.",
        "As a result, the PB model will be able to generate new translations different from the ones in the training data.",
        "From a probabilistic point of view, this process moves some of the probability mass which is concentrated in the training data out to other data still unseen; the very definition of generalization.",
        "Consider a PB model such as: La casa azul|||The blue house Esta casa azul|||This blue house Esta casa verde|||This green house It can be segmented to obtain a new PB model: La|||The casa azul|||blue house Esta|||This casa verde|||green house which is able to generate one new sentence pair (La casa verde?The green house) and has a shorter description length (19 symbols) in comparison to the original model (23 symbols).",
