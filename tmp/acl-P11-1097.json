        "As statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) matures, NLP components are increasingly used in real-world applications.",
        "In many cases, this means that some form of cross-domain adaptation is necessary because there are distributional differences between the labeled training set that is available and the real-world data in the application.",
        "To address this problem, we propose a new type of features for NLP data, features extracted from search engine results.",
        "Our motivation is that search engine results can be viewed as a substitute for the world knowledge that is required in NLP tasks, but that can only be extracted from a standard training set or precompiled resources to a limited extent.",
        "For example, a named entity (NE) recognizer trained on news text may tag the NE London in an out-of-domain web query like London Klondike gold rush as a location.",
        "But if we train the recognizer on features derived from search results for the sentence to be tagged, correct classification as person is possible.",
        "This is because the search results for London Klondike gold rush contain snippets in which the first name Jack precedes London; this is a sure indicator of a last name and hence an NE of type person.",
        "We call our approach piggyback and search result-derived features piggyback features because we piggyback on a search engine like Google for solving a difficult NLP task.",
        "In this paper, we use piggyback features to address a particularly hard cross-domain problem, the application of an NER system trained on news to web queries.",
        "This problem is hard for two reasons.",
        "First, the most reliable cue for NEs in English, as in many languages, is capitalization.",
        "But queries are generally lowercase and even if uppercase characters are used, they are not consistent enough to be reliable features.",
        "Thus, applying NER systems trained on news to web queries requires a robust cross-domain approach.",
        "News to queries adaptation is also hard because queries provide limited context for NEs.",
        "In news text, the first mention of a word like Ford is often a fully qualified, unambiguous name like Ford Motor Corporation or Gerald Ford.",
        "In a short query like buy ford or ford pardon, there is much less context than in news.",
        "The lack of context and capitalization, and the noisiness of real-world web queries (to-kenization irregularities and misspellings) all make NER hard.",
        "The low annotator agreement we found for queries (Section 5) also confirms this point.",
        "The correct identification of NEs in web queries can be crucial for providing relevant pages and ads to users.",
        "Other domains have characteristics similar to web queries, e.g., automatically transcribed speech, social communities like Twitter, and SMS.",
        "Thus, NER for short, noisy text fragments, in the absence of capitalization, is of general importance.",
        "NER performance is to a large extent determined by the quality of the feature representation.",
        "Lexical, part-of-speech (PoS), shape and gazetteer features are standard.",
        "While the impact of different types of features is well understood for standard NER, fundamentally different types of features can be used when leveraging search engine results.",
        "Returning to the NE London in the query London Klondike gold rush, the feature \"proportion of search engine results in which a first name precedes the token of interest\" is likely to be useful in NER.",
        "Since using search engine results for cross-domain robustness is a new approach in NLP, the design of appropriate features is crucial to its success.",
        "A significant part of this paper is devoted to feature design and evaluation.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work.",
        "We describe standard NER features in Section 3.",
        "One main contribution of this paper is the large array of piggyback features that we propose in Section 4.",
        "We describe the data sets we use and our experimental setup in Sections 5-6.",
        "The results in Section 7 show that piggyback features significantly increase NER performance.",
        "This is the second main contribution of the paper.",
        "We discuss challenges of using piggyback features - due to the cost of querying search engines - and present our conclusions and future work in Section 8."

        "Robust cross-domain generalization is key in many NLP applications.",
        "In addition to surface and linguistic differences, differences in world knowledge pose a key challenge, e.g., the fact that Java refers to a location in one domain and to coffee in another.",
        "We have proposed a new way of addressing this challenge.",
        "Because search engines attempt to make optimal use of the context a word occurs in, hits shown to the user usually include other uses of the word in semantically similar snippets.",
        "These snippets can be used as a more robust and domain-independent representation of the context of the word/phrase than what is available in the input text.",
        "Our first contribution is that we have shown that this basic idea of using search engines for robust domain-independent feature representations yields solid results for one specific NLP problem, NER.",
        "Piggyback features achieved an improvement of F1of about 10% compared to a baseline that uses BASE and GAZ features.",
        "Even in-domain, we were able to get a smaller, but still noticeable improvement of 4.2% due to piggyback features.",
        "These results are also important because there are many application domains with noisy text without reliable capitalization, e.g., automatically transcribed speech, tweets, SMS, social communities and blogs.",
        "Our second contribution is that we address a type of NER that is of particular importance: NER for web queries.",
        "The query is the main source of information about the user's information need.",
        "Query analysis is important on the web because understanding the query, including the subtask of NER, is key for identifying the most relevant documents and the most relevant ads.",
        "NER for domains like Twitter and SMS has properties similar to web queries.",
        "A third contribution of this paper is the release of an annotated dataset for web query NER.",
        "We hope that this dataset will foster more research on cross-domain generalization and domain adaptation - in particular for NER - and the difficult problem of web query understanding.",
        "This paper is about cross-domain generalization.",
        "However, the general idea of using search to provide rich context information to NLP systems is applicable to a broad array of tasks.",
        "One of the main hurdles that NLP faces is that the single context a token occurs in is often not sufficient for reliable decisions, be they about attachment, disambiguation or higherorder semantic interpretation.",
        "Search makes dozens of additional relevant contexts available and can thus overcome this bottleneck.",
        "In the future, we hope to be able to show that other NLP tasks can also benefit from such an enriched context representation.",
        "Future work.",
        "We used a web search engine in the experiments presented in this paper.",
        "Latencies when using one of the three main commercial search engines Bing, Google and Yahoo!",
        "in our scenario range from 0.2 to 0.5 seconds per token.",
        "These execution times are prohibitive for many applications.",
        "Search engines also tend to limit the number of queries per user and IP address.",
        "To gain widespread acceptance of the piggyback idea of using search results for robust NLP, we therefore must explore alternatives to search engines.",
        "In future work, we plan to develop more efficient methods of using search results for cross-domain generalization to avoid the cost of issuing a large number of queries to search engines.",
        "Caching will be of obvious importance in this regard.",
        "Another avenue we are pursuing is to build a specialized search system for our application in a way similar to Ca-farella and Etzioni (2005).",
        "While we need good coverage of a large variety of domains for our approach to work, it is not clear how big the index of the search engine must be for good performance.",
        "Conceivably, collections much smaller than those indexed by major search engines (e.g., the Google 1T 5-gram corpus or ClueWeb09) might give rise to features with similar robustness properties.",
        "It is important to keep in mind, however, that one of the key factors a search engine allows us to leverage is the notion of relevance which might not be always possible to model as accurately with other data.",
