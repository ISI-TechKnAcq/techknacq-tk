        "Although namesakes have identical names, their nicknames usually differ.",
        "Therefore, a name disambiguation algorithm can benefit from the knowledge related to name aliases.",
        "We propose an alias extraction method that exploits anchor texts and the links indicated by the anchor texts.",
