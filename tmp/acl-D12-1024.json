        "Automatic text summarization aims to automatically produce a short and well-organized summary of single or multiple documents (Mani, 2001).",
        "Automatic summarization, especially multi-document summarization, has been an increasingly important task in recent years, because of the exponential explosion of available information.",
        "The brief summary that the summarization system produces allows readers to quickly and easily understand the content of original documents without having to read each individual document, and it should be helpful for dealing with enormous amounts of information.",
        "The extractive approach to automatic summarization is a popular and well-known approach in this field, which creates a summary by directly selecting some textual units (e.g., words and sentences) from the original documents, because it is difficult to genuinely evaluate and guarantee the linguistic quality of the produced summary.",
        "One of the most well-known extractive approaches is maximal marginal relevance (MMR), which scores each textual unit and extracts the unit that has the highest score in terms of the MMR criteria (Goldstein et al2000).",
        "Greedy MMR-style algorithms are widely used; however, they cannot take into account the whole quality of the summary due to their greediness, although a summary should convey all the information in given documents.",
        "Global inference algorithms for the extractive approach have been researched widely in recent years (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004; McDonald, 2007; Takamura and Okumura, 2009) to consider whether the summary is ?good?",
        "as a whole.",
        "These algorithms formulate the problem as integer linear programming (ILP) to optimize the score: however, as ILP is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), the time complexity is very large.",
        "Consequently, we need some more efficient algorithm for calculations.",
        "We present a new approach to the problem of automatic text summarization called Automatic Summarization using Reinforcement Learning (ASRL), which models the process of construction of a summary within the framework of reinforcement learn",
        "ing and attempts to optimize the given score function with the given feature representation of a summary.",
        "We demonstrate that the method of reinforcement learning can be adapted to problems with automatic summarization naturally and simply, and other summarizing techniques, such as sentence compression, can be easily adapted as actions of the framework, which should be helpful to enhance the quality of the summary that is produced.",
        "This is the first paper utilizing reinforcement learning for problems with automatic summarization of text.",
        "We evaluated ASRL with the DUC2004 summarization task 2, and the experimental results revealed ASRL is superior to the best method of performance in DUC2004 and comparable with the state of the art ILP-style method, based on maximum coverage with the knapsack constraint problem, in terms of ROUGE scores with experimental settings.",
        "We also evaluated ASRL in terms of optimality and execution time.",
        "The experimental results indicated ASRL can search the state space efficiently for some suboptimal solutions under the condition of effectively selecting features and the score function, and produce a summary whose score denotes the expectation of the score of the same features?",
        "states.",

        "Note that any textual unit is permitted, such as character, word, sentence, phrase, and conceptual unit.",
        "If we determine a sentence is a textual unit to be extracted, the formulated problem is a problem of extracting sentences from the source document, which is one of the most popular settings for summarization tasks.",

        "We can regard the extractive approach as a search problem.",
        "It is extremely difficult to solve this search problem because the final result of evaluation given by the given score function is not available until it finishes, and we therefore need to try all combinations of textual units.",
        "Consequently, the score function, which denotes some criterion for the quality of a summary, tends to be determined so that the function can be decomposed to components and it is solved with global inference algorithms, such as ILP.",
        "However, both decomposing the score function properly and utilizing the evaluation of halfway process of searches are generally difficult.",
        "For example, let us assume that we design the score function by using some complex semantic considerations to take into account the readability of a summary, and the score is efficiently calculated if the whole summary is given.",
        "Then, formulating the problem as a global inference problem and solving it with methods of integer linear programming might generally be difficult, because of the complex composition of the score function, despite the ease with which the whole summary is evaluated.",
        "The readability score might be based on extremely complex calculations of dependency relations, or a great deal of external knowledge the summarizer cannot know",
        "merely from the source documents.",
        "In fact, it is ideal that we can only directly utilize the score function, in the sense that we do not have to consider the decomposed form of the given score function.",
        "We need to consider the problem with automatic summarization to be the same as that with reinforcement learning to handle these problems.",
