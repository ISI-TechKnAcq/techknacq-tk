        "In pursuit of other issues, many studies have adopted a temporary solution to the problem of managing diverse forms of expression, namely, that of choosing a single lexical and grammatical form to express each of the relevant types of information dealt with by the system.",
        "It is then a simple matter of allowing the type of information to determine the appropriate expressional form.",
        "Hovy's text structurer (Hovy 1988b), for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed.",
        "It does not make any decision as to how a chosen relation is to be expressed, but rather leaves this task to the rudimentary implementation of the rhetorical relations provided by the Penman text generation system (Mann 1985).",
        "In the case of a purpose, for example, Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p. 167): \"Knox is en route in order to rendezvous with CTG 070.10.\" A similar approach to expressing rhetorical relations was taken in McKeown's TEXT system (McKeown 1985).",
        "Text generators specifically designed for instructional text, such as Mellish and Evans' generator (Mellish and Evans 1989), EPICURE (Dale 1992), COMET (McKeown et al.",
        "1990), and TECHDOC (Wisner and Stede 1992b), display similar characteristics.",
        "(See the analytical work of Delin, Scott, and Hartley [19931 for a notable exception to this pattern.)",
        "Mellish and Evans' generator, for example, uses the output of NONLIN, a nonlinear planner (Tate 1976), as the preliminary rhetorical structure for the text.",
        "Because this often produced text that was monotonous or hard to understand, they included what was termed a message optimization phase that specifies rules for removing or modifying certain elements of the plan structure that are known to produce poor text.",
        "Although this greatly improves the text, it still tends toward text that is difficult to read.",
        "This problem is, in part, due to the fact that some of the plans they look at are quite complex and correspondingly difficult to express, but it is also attributable to the lack of a detailed corpus study of the linguistic tools used by technical writers in instructional text.",
        "The IMAGENE project can be seen as an extension of their work",
        "that employs such a study to help manage diversity of forms of expression.",
        "There are other natural language generation projects that have addressed similar issues.",
        "Two such examples are Hovy's Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer's Spokesman (Meteer 1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies.",
        "Pauline produces an impressive range of expressional forms that are based on a list of pragmatic features of the communicative environment, including information about the conversational atmosphere, the speaker, the hearer, the relationship between the two, and the interpersonal communicative goals of the speaker.",
        "Its construction required a considerable amount of analysis of sample texts, but unfortunately, very little is said about how this analysis was actually performed and how well the text produced by Pauline matches the text in the corpus.",
        "The concerns of the IMAGENE project are similar, except that both the text type (instructional text) and the linguistic phenomenon (expressing rhetorical relations) are much more focused.",
        "The results of our study are therefore more detailed, but also more constrained (see the concept of domain communication knowledge, as described by Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow [1991]).",
        "In the Spokesman project, Meteer proposed an architecture for addressing what she termed the problem of expressibility in text planning (Meteer 1992).",
        "Her fundamental thesis is that an abstract linguistic representation is needed to provide the text planner with information on constraints of expression (see Vaughan, and McDonald 1987).",
        "Her constraints are taken, at least in part, from a study of text revisions made by expert editors.",
        "The IMAGENE project concurs with this concern for detailed forms of expression, but its methodology is geared toward determining the elements of the communicative context used to choose between equally acceptable alternative forms of expression.",
        "Meteer does not address what to do if, after using her constraints to remove unacceptable forms of expression, there are a number of remaining acceptable forms.",
        "This issue of choice is central to the current study."

        "These sources include instructions for electronic devices like cordless telephones and clock radios, manipulative processes like auto repair and first aid, and creative processes like cooking and craft making.",
        "The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the procedural relations between them.' As an example of the nature of this text, consider the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone (Airfone 1991), which will be called the Remove-Phone text: (2) When instructed (approx.",

        "Return to seat to place calls.",
        "(Airfone 1991)2",
        "This passage gives an example of the variation of expressional form that is common in instructional text.",
        "It contains, among other things, two expressions of purpose: \"remove phone\" and \"to place calls.\" This notion of purpose, which will be detailed in the next section, is one of actions that are to be realized through the execution of expressed sub-actions.",
        "The first is stated as an imperative (\"remove the phone\"), with the sub-actions expressed in participial form within a by prepositional phrase (\"by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out\").",
        "The second (\"to place calls\"), on the other hand, is expressed in final position as a to infinitive, with its sub-action stated as an imperative (\"return to seat\").",
        "The problem to be addressed by the corpus analysis in step 2 is to determine the contextual features used to choose these forms as opposed to the alternate forms that could have expressed the \"same basic information.\" A relational-style database is used to represent the rhetorical, grammatical, and lexical aspects of the corpus.",
        "The representation of the grammatical form of the clauses and phrases is based on traditional principles of syntax and semantics.",
        "Clauses and phrases are represented in separate tables.",
        "Links within the clause table are used to indicate subordinate relations, and links between the clause and phrase tables are used to represent relative clauses and predicate–argument relations.",
        "It also includes semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process).",
        "More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c).",
        "The goal was to allow for the representation of any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or syntactic context that might be relevant in the analysis.",
        "Mann and Thompson's RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations between expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988).",
        "It was developed as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels.",
        "The current study has made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent.",
        "This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone text, and conclude with definitions of the relations used in the study.",
        "RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus–satellite and multi-nuclear schemata.",
        "The nucleus–satellite schema relates two spans of text: one designating a more central span, called the nucleus, and a more peripheral one, called the satellite.",
        "This relation is represented graphically with a directed arrow from the satellite to the nucleus.",
        "Definitions of relations of this sort specify constraints that apply to the nucleus (N), the satellite (S), and the combination of the two and specify the effects of the expression.",
        "Purpose, Precondition, and Result are examples of such relations.",
        "The multi-nuclear schema relates one or more spans, designating no span as superordinate or subordinate to any other.",
        "Definitions of relations of this sort include specification of the constraints on the nuclei and the combination of nuclei, as well as a specification of the effect of the expression.",
        "The Sequence and Concurrent relations are such relations.",
        "RST was attractive for the IMAGENE project because of its ability to represent the hierarchical structure of text with rhetorical structures that matched the level of analysis required for the study of expressions of procedural relations.",
        "There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other.",
        "The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b).",
        "Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; Wisner",
        "and Stede 1992a).",
        "This testifies not only to RST's usefulness, but also to the direct applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural language generation.",
        "Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to other work in this area.",
        "In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the work of Scott and Souza [1990] on expressing rhetorical relations).",
        "Consider the application of RST to the Remove-Phone text.",
        "The first problem that must be addressed in any RST analysis is the segmentation of the text into spans that will serve as the atomic units of description.",
        "In RST, these spans have typically been clauses, as is the case in the Remove-Phone passage, but certain phrases with propositional content may be considered as well.",
        "The spans used in our analysis are propositional units that express single actions.",
        "In the Remove-Phone text, there are six such action expressions, listed here in segmented form:",

        "2. remove phone 3. by firmly grasping top of handset 4. and pulling out.",
        "5.",
        "Return to seat 6. to place calls.",
        "The second problem is one of relating these segments in the appropriate rhetorical structure.",
        "The current study has used the two aspects of the RST specification that can be mapped onto the procedural structure of the process being expressed, namely, the hierarchical structure of RST and the subset of RST relations that correspond to procedural relations.",
        "Each of these two aspects will be discussed with reference to the RST representation for the Remove-Phone text, shown in Figure 1.3 The first aspect of this structure is its hierarchical nature.",
        "The procedural sequence schema at the top of the text hierarchy, for example, indicates that there are two",
        "Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations spans of text that express a sequence of two actions.",
        "The spans themselves can be expressed as single propositional units or as more complex spans, the latter being the case with the two spans in this sequence.",
        "This is a representational manifestation of the hierarchical nature of the processes themselves and is displayed graphically by extending the horizontal line of a span to cover all of its subordinate spans.",
        "The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text is a small portion of the full hierarchy that represents the entire manual.",
        "The current study has focused on the expression of just such local sub-trees; the problems of expression of macro-structure are beyond the scope of the analysis (see Mooney, Carberry, and McCoy 1991).",
        "The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations themselves.",
        "The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process.",
        "They are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic content rather than on intentional or presentational content.' This section will now provide specific definitions of these relations.",
        "The Purpose relation is taken directly from the RST specification.",
        "In this paper, it refers to a situation in which a higher level activity is realized through the execution of lower level sub-steps.",
        "An example can be found in the Remove-Phone text cited above: \"... remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out.\" Here the activity of removing the phone is realized by the execution of the sub-steps of grasping and pulling the phone.",

        "The match was judged on four separate lexical and grammatical issues: linker, form, slot, and clause combining.",
        "The resulting TRL structure had to specify the identical linker (either preposition or conjunction), form (tense, aspect, mood, and voice, or non-finite verb or nominalization), slot (textual order), and combining (if the expression was combined with the following one).",
        "An example of this verification process can be found in Section 5.3, in which the IMAGENE-produced Remove-Phone text is shown to match the original text on all four of these issues.",
        "Note that the match must be exact.",
        "For example, if IMAGENE specifies the conjunction and for a sequence expression when then occurs in the text, the choice of linker would be counted as incorrect, in spite of the fact that the resulting text might be quite understandable.",
        "Note also that IMAGENE's realizations may even be better in some cases than the text in the corpus.",
        "Although the general philosophy of the approach taken in the current study is to assume that the choices made by the writers of the corpus are correct, there are isolated cases in which the forms in the corpus are probably inappropriate.",
        "IMAGENE embodies choices that are consistently made over a range of instructions and thus does not reflect isolated examples.",
        "The analysis conducted in step 2 has been based primarily on a small subset of the full corpus, namely on the instructions for a set of three cordless telephone manuals.",
        "This training set constitutes approximately 35% of our corpus.",
        "The results of this analysis were then implemented in IMAGENE and applied to the full corpus, providing a detailed characterization of the instructions found in the original telephone manuals and a quantitative analysis of how well this characterization applies to the other forms of instructions.",
        "IMAGENE's realizations correctly match all four lexical and grammatical issues in 71% of the expressions in the training set and 52% in the testing set.",
        "The specific levels of match for the four most common rhetorical relations are detailed in Figures 12 and 13.",

        "As can be seen in all of the charts, the level of match is better for the training set, but still good for the testing set.",
        "For purpose expressions, IMAGENE makes use of four different linkers (by, for, so that, and no linker) and six different forms (to infinitive, imperative, nominalization, gerund, goal metonymy, and simple present tense action) and produces a match on all four lexical and grammatical issues for 81% of the purpose expressions in the training set and 59% in the testing set.",
        "Figure 12 gives a breakdown of IMAGENE's accuracy for the four lexical and grammatical issues.",
        "To judge these results more fully, consider an alternative system that always generates the single most common purpose form.",
        "In our corpus, this is the fronted to infinitive, which occurred in 34% of the purpose expressions.18 Such a system would score 34% under the verification criteria used here.",
        "For precondition expressions, the most common form in our corpus is the fronted if present tense clause, which occurred in 19% of the 98 precondition expressions in the corpus.",
        "IMAGENE, which produces five linkers and nine forms, produces a match for 67% of the precondition expressions in the training set and 35% in the testing set.",
        "As can be seen in the precondition chart in Figure 12, IMAGENE's accuracy is lower for preconditions than for purposes, particularly in the testing set.",
        "This reflects the greater diversity of procedural contexts in which preconditions arise and the corresponding diversity of the forms used to express them (see Vander Linden 1994).",
        "Certainly, a larger training set is required here, but it is not clear at this point how much larger it 18 Table 1 indicates 32%, but that would be for our corpus with the non-procedural portions of text included.",

      "text": [
        "This paper has addressed the problem of determining the precise lexical and grammatical forms for expressing procedural relations between actions in the context of instructional text generation.",
        "The corpus-based methodology employed is well suited for this problem, providing both a principled means for cataloging the lexical and grammatical forms that are consistently used in instructional text and an environment for testing and confirming hypotheses concerning the contextual issues that covary with these forms.",
        "The issues of procedural planning, user modeling, and content selection, although of unquestionable importance to the broad goal of generating instructions, were not specifically addressed here.",
        "The current study makes a number of prescriptions for the type of information that such techniques would need to provide to the text planner pursuant to the generation of instructional text, but says nothing about how they should be implemented in order to achieve this.",
        "There are two fundamental contributions of the current study to the field of computational linguistics.",
        "The first is the analysis of instructional text itself.",
        "The current study has provided a characterization of certain aspects of instructional text that has been effectively applied to the generation of instructional text in general.",
        "This characterization is directly applicable to current work on instructional text, particularly in the context of natural language generation.",
        "The results can also serve as a source of preliminary hypotheses with respect to the analysis of other related genres.",
        "The second is the detailed presentation of a methodology for managing diversity of expression at the textual level in the context of text generation.",
        "The approach involves collecting a suitable corpus of text, analyzing that text, implementing the results of the analysis in a text generator, and verifying the output of the generator.",
        "This approach is applicable not just to the problem of expressing procedural relations in instructional text, but rather to any lexical or grammatical aspect of any linguistic genre."
