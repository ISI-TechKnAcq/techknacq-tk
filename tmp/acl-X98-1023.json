        "Summaries of documents are produced in Spanish, Japanese, English and Russian using the same basic summarization engine.",
        "The core summarization problem is taking a single text and producing a shorter text in the same language that contains all the main points in the input text.",
        "We are using a robust, graded approach to building the core engine by incorporating statistical, syntactic and document structure analyses among other techniques.",
        "We have developed a system design which allows the parameterization both of the summarization process and of necessary information about the languages being processed.",
        "Document structure analysis (Salton & Singal 94, Salton et al.",
        "95) is important for extracting the topic of a text.",
        "In a statistical analysis for example (Paice 90, Paice & Jones 93), titles and subtitles would be given a more important weight than the body of the text.",
        "Similarly, the introduction and conclusion for the text itself and for each section are more important than other paragraphs, and the first and last sentences in each paragraph are more important than others.",
        "The applicability of these depends on the style adopted in a particular domain, and on the language: the stylistic structure and the presentation of arguments vary significantly across genres and languages.",
        "Structure analysis must be tailored to a particular type of text in a particular language.",
        "In the MINDS system document structure analysis involves the following subtasks:",
        "• Language Identification • Document Structure Parsing • Multilingual Sentence Segmentation • Text Structure Heuristics",
        "In order to allow a multitude of techniques to contribute to sentence selection, the core engine adopts a flexible method of scoring the sentences in a document by each of the techniques and then ranking them by combining the different scores.",
        "Text-structure based heuristics provide the main method for ranking and selecting sentences in a document.",
        "These are supplemented by word frequency analysis methods.",
        "The core engine is designed in such a way that as additional resources, such as lexical and other knowledge bases or text processing and MT engines, become available from other ongoing research efforts they can be incorporated into the overall multi-engine MINDS system.",
        "The most promising components are part of speech tagging, anaphora resolution, and semantic methods to allow concept identification to supplement word",
        "frequency analysis.",
        "Part of speech tagging has already been used to perform sentence length reduction by stripping out \"superfluous\" words and phrases.",
        "The other methods will be used to maintain document coherence, and to improve sentence selection and reduction.",

        "For example, the analyst's task may be to filter through newspaper articles in many different languages published on a particular day to generate a report on different nations' reactions to a current international event, such as a nuclear test on the previous day.",
        "This last task is currently infeasible for a single analyst, unless he or she understands each one of those languages, since machine translation (MT) of entire documents cannot yet meet the requirements of such a task.",

        "We hope that MLS and MT can mutually benefit from one another since summarization offers MT the benefit of not having to translate entire texts and also spares a user from having to read through an entire document produced by an MT system."
