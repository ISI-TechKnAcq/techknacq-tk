        "Phrase extraction becomes a key component in to-day’s state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems.",
        "With a longer context than unigram, phrase translation models have flexibilities of modelling local word-reordering, and are less sensitive to the errors made from preprocessing steps including word segmentations and tokenization.",
        "However, most of the phrase extraction algorithms rely on good word alignments.",
        "A widely practiced approach explained in details in (Koehn, 2004), (Och and Ney, 2003) and (Tillmann, 2003) is to get word alignments from two directions: source to target and target to source; the intersection or union operation is applied to get refined word alignment with pre-designed heuristics fixing the unaligned words.",
        "With this refined word alignment, the phrase extraction for a given source phrase is essentially to extract the target candidate phrases in the target sentence by searching the left and right projected boundaries.",
        "In (Vogel et al., 2004), they treat phrase alignment as a sentence splitting problem: given a source phrase, find the boundaries of the target phrase such that the overall sentence alignment lexicon probability is optimal.",
        "We generalize it in various ways, esp.",
        "by using a fertility model to get a better estimation of phrase lengths, and a phrase level distortion model.",
        "In our proposed algorithm, we do not need explicit word alignment for phrase extraction.",
        "Thereby it avoids the burden of testing and comparing different heuristics especially for some language specific ones.",
        "On the other hand, the algorithm has such flexibilities that one can incorporate word alignment and heuristics in several possible stages within this proposed framework to further improve the quality of phrase pairs.",
        "In this way, our proposed algorithm is more generalized than the usual word alignment based phrase extraction algorithms.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, The concept of blocks is explained; in section 3, a dynamic programming approach is model the width of the block; in section 4, a simple center distortion of the block; in section 5, the lexicon model; the complete algorithm is in section 6; in section 7, our experience and results using the proposed approach."
