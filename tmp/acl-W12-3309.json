        "Implicit information about events is crucial to any natural language processing task involving temporal understanding and reasoning.",
        "This information comes in many forms, among them knowledge about typical durations for events and knowledge about typical times at which an event occurs.",
        "We know that lunch lasts for perhaps an hour and takes place around noon, and so when we interpret a text such as ?After they ate lunch, they played a game of chess and then went to the zoo?",
        "we can infer that the chess game probably lasted for a few hours and not for several months.",
        "This paper describes a new method for extracting information about typical durations for verbs from tweets posted to the Twitter microblogging site.",
        "Twitter is a rich resource for information about everyday events ?",
        "people post their 'tweets' to Twitter publicly in real-time as they conduct their activities throughout the day, resulting in a significant amount of information about common events.",
        "Data from Twitter is more diverse than the data found in news articles that has typically been used for looking at event durations (Pan et al., 2011).",
        "For example, consider that (1) was used find out that working can last for an hour and a half: (1) Had work for an hour and 30 mins now going to disneyland with my cousins :) I extracted and analyzed a large number of such tweets containing temporal duration information.",
        "This involved identifying relevant tweets, extracting the temporal phrases, and associating these with the verb they modified.",
        "The processes are described below.",
        "Two objectives were investigated in this paper: (1) how to automatically extract duration information for common verbs from Twitter, and (2) to discover the duration distributions for common verbs.",
        "A wide range of factors influence typical durations.",
        "Among these are the character of a verb's arguments, the presence of negation and other embedding features.",
        "For example, eating a snack is different from eating a meal since these events have different durations.",
        "To simplify the task, I set aside tweets wherein the sentence-level verb was negated, or in the conditional or future tenses.",
        "Examining the effect of verb arguments was also set aside in this work.",
        "The problem of finding typical duration for events can be viewed as a coarse-grained task or a fine-grained task.",
        "At the coarse-grained level it could be determined whether or not a chess game lasts for more or less than one day, whereas a fine-grained analysis would indicate that a chess game lasts for minutes or hours.",
        "The results of this work show that Twitter can be mined for duration information with high accuracy using regular expressions.",
        "Likewise, the typical durations for verbs can be summarized in terms of the most frequent duration-measure (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades) as well as by descriptive statistics."

        "For each event, three annotators indicated a lower-bound duration and an upper-bound duration that would cover 80% of the possible cases provided that durations are normally distributed.",
        "They converted the upper and lower bounds into distributions.",
        "They defined annotator agreement to be the average overlap of all the pairwise overlapping areas, calculated using the kappa statistic.",
        "In their experiments, Pan et al. (2011) examined their annotation guidelines and found that annotator agreement was significantly improved after annotators were instructed to use their guidelines.",
        "These guidelines took into consideration information about event classes.",
        "The final guidelines addressed the following kinds of classes: actions vs. states, aspectual events, reporting events (quoted and unquoted reporting), multiple events, events involving negation, appearance events, and positive infinitive duration1.",
        "Human agreement for coarse-grained analysis was reported to be 87.7% whereas agreement for fine-grained analysis was 79.8%.",
        "Hand-annotation is an expensive way of acquiring typical duration and human annotators do not always agree on how long events last.",
