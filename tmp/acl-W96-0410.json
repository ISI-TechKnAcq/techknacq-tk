        "Words come in a variety of conventional combinations; these units range from short expressions with idiosyncratic meanings, like the call number of a book, to full sentences with compositionally-derived, yet frozen, meanings, like You can't teach an old dog new tricks.",
        "Natural language generation systems must adhere to these combinations, or risk that output will sound as if translated, badly, from Lisp.",
        "Conventional combinations represent not just familiar words, but familiar meanings.",
        "Novel descriptions can be unintelligible even if more literally accurate â€“ imagine the key string of a book, instead of call number.",
        "Alternatives to stock language can be even more absurd:' The authors thank Aravind Joshi, Mark Steed-man, Martha Palmer, Ellen Prince, Owen Rambow, Mike White, Joseph Rosenzweig, Betty Birner for their helpful comments on various stages of this work.",

        "(1) It is futile to attempt to indoctrinate a superannuated canine with innovative maneuvers.",
        "To naturally reuse familiar meanings, generation systems should exploit opportunities to do so as meaning is constructed, not just in transducing meaning to a surface representation.",
        "Following this line, the research presented here concerns generating idioms and collocations as part of SENTENCE PLANNING (Kittredge et al., 1991).",
        "Our approach uses Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) and takes DESCRIPTION as the paradigm for the final realization of content.",
        "We build on the existing insights of linguists (including (Pustejovsky, 1991; MeHuk and Polguere, 1987; Nunberg eta!., 1994)) and implementations (including (Reiter and Dale, 1992; Viegas and Bouillon, 1994; Smadja and McKeown, 1991)).",
        "However, our proposal introduces two key features.",
        "First, the syntax AND SEMANTICS of collocations is planned incrementally and simultaneously.",
        "This simplifies the design of the procedure and the linguistic representations it requires; it grounds the decision to select a particular collocation; and it helps integrate the different decisions that must be made in sentence planning.",
        "Second, we treat collocations and idioms not just as lexicographic entries, but with full semantics and pragmatics.",
        "This allows us to generate specialized uses of words not just in certain lexical or syntactic contexts, but more generally in appropriate discourse contexts.",
        "The use of these conventional meanings is a consequence of the systematic design of our planner to observe a computational interpretation of Grice's Maxim of Manner (Grice, 1975): say the usual thing unless you mean something different.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",
        "In section 2, we review treatments of collocation in linguistic theory and natural language generation.",
        "In section 3 we describe the generation system, SPUD, within which the present analysis will be",

        "The different constructions that can be described as collocations exhibit an enormous range of con-ventionalization.",
        "On the one hand are arbitrary, fixed, undecomposable combinations like by and large; on the other are locutions like override a veto whose preferred co-occurrence derives from the specificity of the semantics of the components.",
        "Between these extremes are three classes of constructions of particular concern for natural language generation.",
        "First, IDIOMATICALLY COMBINING EXPRESSIONS (Nunberg et al., 1994) must be derived compositionally from special, idiomatic meanings of their parts, as when strings = influence, pull = exert privately (from the OED): (2) The strings she pulled didn't get her the job.",
        "Second, COLLOCATIONS PROPER involve constituents whose meaning is determined by ordinary principles, like copy area, but which must be regarded as conventional in light of the oddness of near synonyms (like duplication zone); such collocations are the subject of the Lexical Functions of the Meaning-Text Theory (mu) (Mel'6uk and Polguere, 1987).",
        "Finally, SEMANTIC COLLOCATIONS like long book derive their particular meaning from the recovery in context of parameters for events and other entities (Pustejovsky, 1991).",
        "Researchers in generation rarely address all of these kinds of conventionality.",
        "For example, (Viegas and Bouillon, 1994) handle semantic collocations by implementing Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon Theory (GLT); modifiers take on specialized meanings derived from salient processes and characteristics associated with the heads they modify.",
        "Thus, a long book means a long book to read because of a lexicographic association between books and reading.",
        "Similarly, implementations of mu describe the conventional use of certain modifiers with heads (MerOuk and Polguere, 1987; Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Wanner, 1994) using Lexical Functions.",
        "Thus, a function Magn determines the realization of a concept very, intense, intensely:",

        "Copy area would be handled using the Lexical Function Sioc, which returns the name of the location associated with an activity.",
        "(Smadja and McKeown, 1991) are an exception in trzating a wide range of conventionality, but they simply list the idiomatic status and meaning of a variety of forms in a way that collapses the diistinct theoretical status, and to a large extent, the distinct meanings, of different collocations.",
        "These various existing computational approaches have three main deficiencies.",
        "First, they derive conventionality from relational lexicons that describe only the properties of WORDS.",
        "However, the features that determine appropriateness of conventional attributions are better modelled as properties of OBJECTS in an evolving model of discourse.",
        "Idiomatically combining expressions introduce entities for subsequent reference:",

        "c Whew!",
        "[after burrowing and swimming out of Alcatraz, amid nearby shots and searchlights] That was narrow!",
        "Second, by treating different conventional combinations as mere paraphrases of one another, researchers complicate the statement of when and why to use conventional forms.",
        "No specification of idiomatic combination is complete without representing the pragmatic circumstances in which its use is appropriate (e.g. saying to someone Your goose is cooked is not appropriate as a expression of sympathy; the expression conveys a certain amount of disregard for their predicament).",
        "Meanwhile, some representation of entities and their salience is required to determine whether ellipsis is possible in context.",
        "Whether a hard idea is hard to formalize, to communicate, or to understand depends on the topic; to be clear, a natural language system must model how its audience arrives at such understandings.",
        "Third, by recognizing collocations only when transducing underlying semantic representations, researchers limit the extent to which knowledge of collocations can be exploited in generating flu",
        "ent text.",
        "In particular, transduction presupposes that the content of referring expressions has already been established.",

        "However, whereas the planning procedures on which we base our system are used only for noun phrases, we apply this procedure to the sentence as a whole using a rich semantic representation; further, although these procedures typically construct an abstract semantic representation, we treat operators as entries with syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties.",

        "TAG (Joshi et al., 1975) is a grammar formalism built around two operations that combine pairs of trees: SUBSTITUTION and ADJOINING.",

        "Analogously, an entity is either new or old to the DISCOURSE, according to whether the discourse contains an earlier reference to it.",
        "Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "At any point, salience assigns each entity a position in a partial order that indicates how accessible it is for reference in the current context.",
        "Third, entities are related by material PARTIALLY-ORDERED SET (POSEÂ° RELATIONS to other entities in the context (Hirschberg, 1985).",
        "These relations include part and whole, subset and superset, and membership in a common class; a number of constructions depend on poset relations to signal their connection with context.",

        "Hence, the first step is to identify applicable lexical entries: these items must correctly describe some entity; they must anchor trees that can substitute or adjoin into a node that describes the entity; and they must contribute toward satisfying current goals.",
        "(We describe more precisely how this contribution is evaluated in section 4.1.)",
        "Then, the second step identifies which of the associated trees are applicable, by testing their pragmatic conditions against the current representation of discourse.",

        "For example, since periodicals are easily identified by their date of issue, we should make this state salient.",
        "Note then that salience is determined for explicitly mentioned and inferable entities and depends not only on recency of mention but also on facts about the conversational situation and real-world relationships between objects.",
        "Reiter and Dale also point out that which characterizations are basic-level must be adjusted to reflect the expertise of the addressee; however, we shall sidestep this issue here by assuming that certain lexical items are simply listed as basic-level terms.",
        "By itself, these additions are not enough: SPUD must also take salience and basic-level semantics into account in the evaluation of its alternatives.",
        "That is: other things being equal, SPUD should choose to incorporate at each stage the",
        "syntactic-semantic-pragmatic unit which refers to maximally salient entities; and, other things being equal, SPUD should incorporate a basic-level predicate.",
        "Integrating Reiter and Dale's prioritization of these considerations with SPUD'S other considerations leads to the following ranking of criteria for comparison:",
        "(7) RULES OUT A DISTRACTOR OR ENTAILS NEEDED INFORMATION > SALIENCE OF ENTITIES MENTIONED > NUMBER OF DISTRACTORS RULED OUT > NUMBER OF INFORMATIONAL GOALS ACHIEVED > BASIC-LEVEL TERM > SPECIFICITY OF LICENSING CONDITIONS",
        "With the right linguistic specification, this is all the machinery SPUD needs to generate conventionalized forms.",
        "To see how we can generate ordinary collocations, consider describing parts of a library.",
        "Descriptions of these places are typically collocations: e.g. copy area, reference desk, interlibrary loan office.",
        "The names can be abbreviated in context, they can be interpreted compositionally, but substituting synonyms generally sounds odd.",
        "Nevertheless, these descriptions share features, in that one always describes its type, sometimes the service it provides, and most rarely its location.",
        "This leads to the following axiomatization of the salience of states:",
        "The first argument of each predicate is the information state in which the various predications hold; the second argument is the eventuality which witnesses the application of the predicate; >s indicates the salience ranking of the states.",
        "Thus, (8) considers a case where there is a part Part of a library Lib: suppose S3 witnesses that Part has some type Type; S4, that Part provides service Service; and S5, that Part has location Loc.",
        "Then, S4 is more salient than S5, and S3 is more salient than both.",
        "We must specify not only the salience of different states for the same copier, but also the salience of corresponding states for different copiers.",
        "Another axiom, similar to (8), ensures that states that specify a given attribute are equally salient across copiers when the copiers involved are equally salient.",
        "The vocabulary chosen, meanwhile, reflects conventional names for the structures and services of the library.",
        "Semantic declarations such as the following represent this:",
        "That is, area uses the specified semantics to provide a basic-level description of A in terms of state S and information I.",
        "Note that SPUD always chooses a maximally specific licensed form out of equally good alternatives.",
        "Thus, we can have any number of basic-level terms to describe an object, and the appropriate one will be selected on the basis of its specificity.",
        "For example, even if both room and area are basic, a room will be still be described using room, because all rooms are areas but not all areas are rooms.",
        "Together, these assumptions suffice to generate collocations for library parts.",
        "For example, suppose SPUD has the goal of describing the part of the library where copying takes place, location e30.",
        "SPUD first selects the NP the area, eliminating alternatives like the room, the desk, the stack, because they do not truthfully describe e30.",
        "However, since many other parts of the library are also areas, the current description does not rule out all possible distractors, and SPUD further elaborates the description.",
        "The modifiers copy and service are both applicable to e30, but copy eliminates all distractors while service does not, so the former is selected, yielding the final NP the copy area."

        "Such differences will allow SPUD to generate different collocations in different languages, even when describing the same entities.",
