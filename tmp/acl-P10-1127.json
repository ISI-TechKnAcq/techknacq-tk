        "The number of images tagged with location information on the web is growing rapidly, facilitated by the availability of GPS (Global Position System) equipped cameras and phones, as well as by the widespread use of online social sites.",
        "The majority of these images are indexed with GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) only and/or have minimal captions.",
        "This typically small amount of textual information associated with the image is of limited usefulness for image indexing, organization and search.",
        "Therefore methods which could automatically supplement the information available for image indexing and lead to improved image retrieval would be extremely useful.",
        "Following the general approach proposed by Aker and Gaizauskas (2009), in this paper we describe a method for automatic image captioning or caption enhancement starting with only a scene or subject type and a set of place names pertaining to an image - for example (church, {St.",
        "Paul's,London|).",
        "Scene type and place names can be obtained automatically given GPS coordinates and compass information using techniques such as those described in Xin et al.",
        "(2010) - that task is not the focus of this paper.",
        "Our method applies only to images of static features of the built or natural landscape, i.e. objects with persistent geo-coordinates, such as buildings and mountains, and not to images of objects which move about in such landscapes, e.g. people, cars, clouds, etc.",
        "However, our technique is suitable not only for image captioning but in any application context that requires summary descriptions of instances of object classes, where the instance is to be characterized in terms of the features typically mentioned in describing members of the class.",
        "Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) have argued that humans appear to have a conceptual model of what is salient regarding a certain object type (e.g. church, bridge, etc.)",
        "and that this model informs their choice of what to say when describing an instance of this type.",
        "They also experimented with representing such conceptual models using n-gram language models derived from corpora consisting of collections of descriptions of instances of specific object types (e.g. a corpus of descriptions of churches, a corpus of bridge descriptions, and so on) and reported results showing that incorporating such n-gram language models as a feature in a feature-based extractive summarizer improves the quality of automatically generated summaries.",
        "The main weakness of n-gram language models is that they only capture very local information about short term sequences and cannot model long distance dependencies between terms.",
        "For example one common and important feature of object descriptions is the simple specification of the object type, e.g. the information that the object London Bridge is a bridge or that the Rhine is a river.",
        "If this information is expressed as in the first line of Table 1, n-gram language models are likely to",
        "Table 1: Example of sentences which express the type of an object.",
        "London Bridge is a bridge...",
        "The Rhine (German: Rhein; Dutch: Rijn; French: Rhin; Romansh: Rain; Italian: Reno; Latin: Rhenus West Frisian Ryn) is one of the longest and most important rivers in Europe...",
        "reflect it, since one would expect the tri-gram is a bridge to occur with high frequency in a corpus of bridge descriptions.",
        "However, if the type predication occurs with less commonly seen local context, as is the case for the object Rhine in the second row of Table 1 - most important rivers - n-gram language models may well be unable to identify it.",
        "Intuitively, what is important in both these cases is that there is a predication whose subject is the object instance of interest and the head of whose complement is the object type: London Bridge ... is ... bridge and Rhine ... is ... river.",
        "Sentences matching such patterns are likely to be important ones to include in a summary.",
        "This intuition suggests that rather than representing object type conceptual models via corpus-derived language models as do Aker and Gaizauskas (2009), we do so instead using corpus-derived dependency patterns.",
        "We pursue this idea in this paper, our hypothesis being that information that is important for describing objects of a given type will frequently be realized linguistically via expressions with the same dependency structure.",
        "We explore this hypothesis by developing a method for deriving common dependency patterns from object type corpora (Section 2) and then incorporating these patterns into an extractive summarization system (Section 3).",
        "In Section 4 we evaluate the approach both by scoring against model summaries and via a readability assessment.",
        "Since our work aims to extend the work of Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) we reproduce their experiments with n-gram language models in the current setting so as to permit accurate comparison.",
        "Multi-document summarizers face the problem of avoiding redundancy: often, important information which must be included in the summary is repeated several times across the document set, but must be included in the summary only once.",
        "We can use the dependency pattern approach to address this problem in a novel way.",
        "The common approach to avoiding redundancy is to use a text similarity measure to block the addition of a further sentence to the summary if it is too similar to one already included.",
        "Instead, since specific dependency patterns express specific types of information we can group the patterns into groups expressing the same type of information and then, during sentence selection, ensure that sentences matching patterns from different groups are selected in order to guarantee broad, non-redundant coverage of information relevant for inclusion in the summary.",
        "We report work experimenting with this idea too."

        "We have proposed a method by which dependency patterns extracted from corpora of descriptions of instances of particular object types can be used in a multi-document summarizer to automatically generate image descriptions.",
        "Our evaluations show that such an approach yields summaries which score more highly than an approach which uses a simpler representation of an object type model in the form of a n-gram language model.",

        "These dependency pattern models also achieved a modest improvement over Wikipedia baseline ROUGE SU4.",
        "Furthermore, we showed that using dependency patterns in combination with features reported in Aker and Gaizauskas to produce a structured summary led to significantly better results than Wikipedia baseline summaries as assessed by ROUGE.",
        "However, human assessed readability showed that there is still scope for improvement.",
        "These results indicate that dependency patterns are worth investigating for object focused automated summarization tasks.",
        "Such investigations should in particular concentrate on how dependency patterns can be used to structure information within the summary, as our best results were achieved when dependency patterns were used for this purpose.",
        "There are a number of avenues to pursue in future work.",
        "One is to explore how dependency patterns could be used to produce generative summaries and/or perform sentence trimming.",
        "Another is to investigate how dependency patterns might be automatically clustered into groups expressing similar or related facts, rather than relying on manual categorization of dependency patterns into categories such as \"type\", \"year\", etc.",
        "as was done here.",
        "Evaluation should be extended to investigate the utility of the automatically generated image descriptions for image retrieval.",
        "Finally, we also plan to analyze automated ways for learning information structures (e.g. what is the flow of facts to describe a location) from existing image descriptions to produce better summaries."
