        "Existing evaluation metrics for machine translation lack crucial robustness: their correlations with human quality judgments vary considerably across languages and genres.",
        "We believe that the main reason is their inability to properly capture meaning: A good translation candidate means the same thing as the reference translation, regardless of formulation.",
        "We propose a metric that evaluates MT output based on a rich set of features motivated by textual entailment, such as lexical-semantic (in-)compatibility and argument structure overlap.",
        "We compare this metric against a combination metric of four state-of-the-art scores (BLEU, NIST, TER, and METEOR) in two different settings.",

        "Constant evaluation is vital to the progress of machine translation (MT).",
        "Since human evaluation is costly and difficult to do reliably, a major focus of research has been on automatic measures of MT quality, pioneered by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002).",
        "BLEU and NIST measure MT quality by using the strong correlation between human judgments and the degree of n-gram overlap between a system hypothesis translation and one or more reference translations.",
        "The resulting scores are cheap and objective.",
        "However, studies such as Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) have identified a number of problems with BLEU and related n-gram-based scores: (1) BLEU-like metrics are unreliable at the level of individual sentences due to data sparsity; (2) BLEU metrics can be \"gamed\" by permuting word order; (3) for some corpora and languages, the correlation to human ratings is very low even at the system level; (4) scores are biased towards statistical MT; (5) the quality gap between MT and human translations is not reflected in equally large BLEU differences.",
        "* This paper is based on work funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency through IBM.",
        "The content does not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. Government, and no official endorsement should be inferred.",
        "This is problematic, but not surprising: The metrics treat any divergence from the reference as a negative, while (computational) linguistics has long dealt with linguistic variation that preserves the meaning, usually called paraphrase, such as:",
        "(1) HYP: However, this was declared terrorism by observers and witnesses.",
        "REF: Nevertheless, commentators as well as eyewitnesses are terming it terrorism.",
        "A number of metrics have been designed to account for paraphrase, either by making the matching more intelligent (TER, Snover et al.",
        "(2006)), or by using linguistic evidence, mostly lexical similarity (METEOR, Banerjee and Lavie (2005); MaxSim, Chan and Ng (2008)), or syntactic overlap (Owczarzak et al.",
        "(2008); Liu and Gildea (2005)).",
        "Unfortunately, each metrics tend to concentrate on one particular type of linguistic information, none of which always correlates well with human judgments.",
        "Our paper proposes two strategies.",
        "We first explore the combination of traditional scores into a more robust ensemble metric with linear regression.",
        "Our second, more fundamental, strategy replaces the use of loose surrogates of translation quality with a model that attempts to comprehensively assess meaning equivalence between references and MT hypotheses.",
        "We operationalize meaning equivalence by bidirectional textual entailment (RTE, Dagan et al.",
        "(2005)), and thus predict the quality of MT hypotheses with a rich RTE feature set.",
        "The entailment-based model goes beyond existing word-level \"semantic\" metrics such as METEOR by integrating phrasal and compositional aspects of meaning equivalence, such as multiword paraphrases, (in-)correct argument and modification relations, and (dis-)allowed phrase reorderings.",

      "text": [
        "Our novel approach to MT evaluation exploits the similarity between MT evaluation and textual entailment (TE).",
        "TE was introduced by Dagan et al.",
        "(2005) as a concept that corresponds more closely to \"common sense\" reasoning patterns than classical, strict logical entailment.",
        "Textual entailment is defined informally as a relation between two natural language sentences (a premise P and a hypothesis H) that holds if \"a human reading P would infer that H is most likely true\".",
        "Knowledge about entailment is beneficial for NLP tasks such as Question Answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).",
        "The relation between textual entailment and MT evaluation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Perfect MT output and the reference translation entail each other (top).",
        "Translation problems that impact semantic equivalence, e.g., deletion or addition of material, can break entailment in one or both directions (bottom).",
        "On the modelling level, there is common ground between RTE and MT evaluation: Both have to distinguish between valid and invalid variation to determine whether two texts convey the same information or not.",
        "For example, to recognize the bidirectional entailment in Ex.",
        "(1), RTE must account for the following reformulations: synonymy (However/Nevertheless), more general semantic relatedness (observers/commentators), phrasal replacements (and/as well as), and an active/passive alternation that implies structural change (is declared/are terming).",
        "This leads us to our main hypothesis: RTE features are designed to distinguish meaning-preserving variation from true divergence and are thus also good predictors in MT evaluation.",
        "However, while the original RTE task is asymmetric, MT evaluation needs to determine meaning equivalence, which is a symmetric relation.",
        "We do this by checking for entailment in both directions (see Figure 1).",
        "Operationally, this ensures we detect translations which either delete or insert material.",
        "Clearly, there are also differences between the two tasks.",
        "An important one is that RTE assumes the well-formedness of the two sentences.",
        "This is not generally true in MT, and could lead to degraded linguistic analyses.",
        "However, entailment relations are more sensitive to the contribution of individual words (MacCartney and Manning, 2008).",
        "In Example 2, the modal modifiers break the entailment between two otherwise identical sentences:",
        "(2) HYP: Peter is certainly from Lincolnshire.",
        "REF: Peter is possibly from Lincolnshire.",
        "This means that the prediction of TE hinges on correct semantic analysis and is sensitive to mis-analyses.",
        "In contrast, human MT judgments behave robustly.",
        "Translations that involve individual errors, like (2), are judged lower than perfect ones, but usually not crucially so, since most aspects are still rendered correctly.",
        "We thus expect even noisy RTE features to be predictive for translation quality.",
        "This allows us to use an off-the-shelf RTE system to obtain features, and to combine them using a regression model as described in Section 2.",
        "The Stanford Entailment Recognizer (MacCartney et al., 2006) is a stochastic model that computes match and mismatch features for each premise-hypothesis pair.",
        "The three stages of the system are shown in Figure 2.",
        "The system first uses a robust broad-coverage PCFG parser and a deterministic constituent-dependency converter to construct linguistic representations of the premise and",

        "Hypothesis: India acquires arms.",

        "The results are typed dependency graphs that contain a node for each word and labeled edges representing the grammatical relations between words.",
        "Named entities are identified, and contiguous collocations grouped.",
        "Next, it identifies the highest-scoring alignment from each node in the hypothesis graph to a single node in the premise graph, or to null.",
        "It uses a locally decomposable scoring function: The score of an alignment is the sum of the local word and edge alignment scores.",
        "The computation of these scores make extensive use of about ten lexical similarity resources, including WordNet, InfoMap, and Dekang Lin's thesaurus.",
        "Since the search space is exponential in the hypothesis length, the system uses stochastic (rather than exhaustive) search based on Gibbs sampling (see de Marneffe et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "Entailment features.",
        "In the third stage, the system produces roughly 100 features for each aligned premise-hypothesis pair.",
        "A small number of them are real-valued (mostly quality scores), but most are binary implementations of small linguistic theories whose activation indicates syntactic and semantic (mis-)matches of different types.",
        "Figure 2 groups the features into five classes.",
        "Alignment features measure the overall quality of the alignment as given by the lexical resources.",
        "Semantic compatibility features check to what extent the aligned material has the same meaning and preserves semantic dimensions such as modality and factivity, taking a limited amount of context into account.",
        "Insertion/deletion features explicitly address material that remains unaligned and assess its felicity.",
        "Reference features ascertain that the two sentences actually refer to the same events and participants.",
        "Finally, structural features add structural considerations by ensuring that argument structure is preserved in the translation.",
        "See MacCartney et al.",
        "(2006) for details on the features, and Sections 5 and 6 for examples of feature firings.",

        "The focus of this study was on the use of an existing RTE infrastructure for MT evaluation.",
        "Future work will have to assess the effectiveness of individual features and investigate ways to customize RTE systems for the MT evaluation task.",
        "An interesting aspect that we could not follow up on in this paper is that entailment features are linguistically interpretable (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "2) and may find use in uncovering systematic shortcomings of MT systems.",
        "A limitation of our current metric is that it is language-dependent and relies on NLP tools in the target language that are still unavailable for many languages, such as reliable parsers.",
        "To some extent, of course, this problem holds as well for state-of-the-art MT systems.",
