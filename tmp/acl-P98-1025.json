        "Recent theorizing in linguistics brought forth a level of representation called the Predicate-Argument Structure (PAS).",
        "PAS acts as the interface between lexical semantics and d-structure in GB (Grimshaw, 1990), functional structure in LFG (Alsina, 1996), and complement structure in HPSG (Wechsler, 1995).",
        "PAS is the sole level of representation in Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1996).",
        "All formulations assume a prominence-based structured representation for PAS, although they differ in the terms used for defining prominence.",
        "For instance, Grimshaw (1990) defines the thematic hierarchy as: Agent > Experiencer > Goal / Location / Source > Theme • Thanks to Mark Steedman for discussion and material, and to the anonymous reviewer of an extended version whose comments led to significant revisions.",
        "This research is supported by TUBITAK (EEEAG-90) and NATO Science Division (TU-LANGUAGE).",
        "whereas LFG accounts make use of the following (Bresnan and Kanerva, 1989): Agent > Beneficiary > Goal / Experiencer > Inst > Patient / Theme > Locative.",
        "As an illustration, the predicate-argument structures of the agentive verb murder and the psychological verb fear are (Grimshaw, 1990, p.8):",
        "To abstract away from language-particular case systems and mapping of thematic roles to grammatical functions, I assume the Applicative Hierarchy of Shaumyan (1987) for the definition of prominence:",
        "Primacy of a term over another is defined by the former having a wider range of syntactic features than the latter.",
        "In an accusative language, subjects are less marked (hence primary) than objects; all verbs take subjects but only transitive verbs take objects.",
        "Terms (=arguments) can be denoted by the genotype indices on NPs, such as NPi, NP2 for primary and secondary terms.'",
        "An NP2 would be a direct object (NPa„) in an accusative language, or an ergative-marked NP (NPerg) in an ergative language.",
        "This level of description also simplifies the formulation of grammatical function changing; the primary term of a passivized predicate (PAss p) is the secondary term of the active p. I follow Shaumyan and Steedman (1996) also in the ordered representation of the PAS (1).",

        "However, in a non-configurational language, permutations of word order are possible, and grammatical functions are often indicated not by configurations but by case marking.",
        "For instance, in Turkish, all six permutations of the basic SOV order are possible, and Japanese allows two verb-final permutations of underlying SOV.",
        "The relationship between case marking and scrambling is crucial in languages with flexible word order.",
        "A computational solution to the problem must rely on some principles of parsimony for representing categories and types of arguments and predicates, and efficiency of processing.",
        "In a categorial formulation, grammatical functions of preverbal and postverbal NPs in (2) can be made explicit by type shifting2 the subject to S/(S\\NP1) and the object to (S\\NP1)\\((S\\NP1 )/NP2).",
        "These categories follow from the order-preserving type shifting scheme (Dowty, 1988):",
        "(3) NP T/(T\\NP) or TVT/NP)",
        "To resolve the opposition between surface order and the PAS in a free word order language, one can let the type shifted categories of terms proliferate, or reformulate CCG in such a way that arguments of the verbs are sets, rather than lists whose arguments are made available one at a time.",
        "The former alternative makes the spurious ambiguity problem of CG parsing (Karttunen, 1989) even more severe.",
        "Multi-set CCG (Hoffman, 1995) is an example of the set-oriented approach.",
        "It is known to be computationally tractable but less efficient than the polynomial time CCG algorithm of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993).",
        "I try to show in this paper that the traditional curried notation of CG with type shifting can be maintained to account for Surface Form44PAS mapping without leading to proliferation of argument categories or to spurious ambiguity.",

        "Grammatical functions of the nouns in the lexicon are assigned 2aka.",

        "In order to derive all permutations of a ditransi-tive construction in Turkish using (3), the dative-marked indirect object (NP3) must be type shifted in 48 (4!2) different ways so that coordination with the left-adjacent and the right-adjacent constituent is possible.",
