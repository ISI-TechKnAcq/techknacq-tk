        "Current research in automatic single-document summarization is dominated by two effective, yet na¨ıve approaches: summarization by sentence extraction and headline generation via bag-of-words models.",
        "While successful in some tasks, neither of these models is able to adequately capture the large set of linguistic devices utilized by humans when they produce summaries.",
        "One possible explanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have been developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing document/abstract and document/headline corpora.",
        "We believe that future progress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of more sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective leveraging of document/abstract corpora.",
        "In order to open the doors to simultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for automatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts.",
        "These alignments make explicit the correspondences that exist in such document/abstract pairs and create a potentially rich data source from which complex summarization algorithms may learn.",
        "This paper describes experiments we have carried out to analyze the ability of humans to perform such alignments, and based on these analyses, we describe experiments for creating them automatically.",
        "Our model for the alignment task is based on an extension of the standard hidden Markov model and learns to create alignments in a completely unsupervised fashion.",

        "One reason for this is that currently available technologies are only able to extract very coarse and superficial information that is inadequate for training complex models.",
        "In this article, we propose a method to overcome this problem: automatically generating word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts.1 To facilitate discussion and to motivate the problem, we show in Figure 1 a relatively simple alignment between a document fragment and its corresponding abstract fragment from our corpus.2 In this example, a single abstract sentence (shown along the top of the figure) corresponds to exactly two document sentences (shown along the bottom of the figure).",
        "If we are able to automatically generate such alignments, one can envision the development of models of summarization that take into account effects of word choice, phrasal and sentence reordering, and content selection.",
        "Such models could be simultaneously linguistically motivated and data-driven.",
        "Furthermore, such alignments are potentially useful for current-day summarization techniques, including sentence extraction, headline generation, and document compression.",
        "A close examination of the alignment shown in Figure 1 leads us to three observations about the nature of the relationship between a document and its abstract, and hence about the alignment itself:",
        "• Alignments can occur at the granularity of words and of phrases.",
        "• The ordering of phrases in an abstract can be different from the ordering of phrases in the document.",
        "• Some abstract words do not have direct correspondents in the document, and many document words are never used in an abstract.",
        "In order to develop an alignment model that could recreate such an alignment, we need our model to be able to operate both at the word level and at the phrase level, we need it to be able to allow arbitrary reorderings, and we need it to be able to account for words on both the document and abstract side that have no direct correspondence.",

        "While such approaches have enjoyed some success, they all suffer from modeling shortcomings.",
        "Sentence extraction systems and document compression models make unrealistic assumptions about the summarization task (namely, that extraction is sufficient and that sentences are the appropriate level of granularity).",
        "Headline generation systems employ very weak models that make an incorrect bag-of-words assumption.",

        "As we can see from Table 4, none of the machine translation models is well suited to this task, achieving, at best, an F-score of 0.298.",
        "The flipped models, in which the document sentences are the source language and the abstract sentences are the target language perform significantly better (comparatively).",
        "Since the MT models are not symmetric, going the bad way requires that many document words have zero fertility, which is difficult for these models to cope with.",
        "The Cut and Paste method performs significantly better, which is to be expected, since it is designed specifically for summarization.",
        "As one would expect, this method achieves higher precision than recall, though not by very much.",
        "The fact that the Cut and Paste model performs so well, compared to the MT models, which are able to learn non-identity correspondences, suggests that any successful model should be able to take advantage of both, as ours does.",
        "Our methods significantly outperform both the IBM models and the Cut and Paste method, achieving a precision of 0.522 and a recall of 0.712, yielding an overall F-score of 0.606 when stop words are not considered.",
        "This is still below the human-against-human F-score of 0.775 (especially considering that the true human-against-human scores are 1.0), but significantly better than any of the other models.",
        "Among the three settings of our jump table, the syntax-based model performs best, followed by the relative jump model, with the Gaussian model coming in worst (though still better than any other approach).",
        "Inspecting Figure 2, the fact that the Gaussian model does not perform well is not surprising; the data shown there is very non-Gaussian.",
        "A double-exponential model might be a better fit, but it is unlikely that such a model will outperform the syntax based model, so we did not perform this experiment."

        "The first mistake frequently made by our model is to not align summary words to null.",
        "In effect, this means that our model of null-generated summary words is lacking.",
        "An example of this error is shown in Example 1 in Figure 8.",
        "In this example, the model has erroneously aligned from DOS in the abstract to from DOS in the document (the error is shown in bold).",
        "This alignment is wrong because the context offrom DOS in the document is completely different from the context it appears in the summary.",
        "However, the identity rewrite model has overwhelmed the locality model and forced this incorrect alignment.",
        "To measure the frequency of such errors, we have post-processed our system’s alignments so that whenever a human alignment contains a null-generated summary word, our model also predicts that this word is null-generated.",
        "Doing so will not change our system’s recall, but it can improve the precision.",
        "Indeed, in the case of the relative jump model, the precision jumps from 0.456 to 0.523 (F-score increases",
        "from 0.548 to 0.594) in the case of all words and from 0.512 to 0.559 (F-score increases from 0.593 to 0.624).",
        "This corresponds to a relative improvement of roughly 8% F-score.",
        "Increases in score for the syntax-based model are roughly the same.",
        "The second mistake our model frequently makes is to trust the identity rewrite model too strongly.",
        "This problem has to do either with synonyms that do not appear frequently enough for the system to learn reliable rewrite probabilities, or with corefer-ence issues, in which the system chooses to align, for instance, Microsoft to Microsoft, rather than Microsoft to the company, as might be correct in context.",
        "As suggested by this example, this problem is typically manifested in the context of coreferential noun phrases.",
        "It is difficult to perform a similar analysis of this problem as for the aforementioned problem (to achieve an upper bound on performance), but we can provide some evidence.",
        "As mentioned before, in the human alignments, roughly 51% of all aligned phrases are lexically identical.",
        "In the alignments produced by our model (on the same documents), this number is 69%.",
        "In the case of stem identity, the hand-aligned data suggests that stem identity should hold in 67% of the cases; in our alignments, this number was 81%.",
        "An example of this sort of error is shown in Example 2 in Figure 8.",
        "Here, the model has aligned The DMP 300 in the abstract to The DMP 300 in the document, while it should have been aligned to the printer due to locality constraints (note that the model also misses the (produces ↔ producing) alignment, likely as a side-effect of it making the error depicted in bold).",
        "In Table 5, we have shown examples of common errors made by our system (these were randomly selected from a much longer list of errors).",
        "These examples are shown out of their contexts, but in most cases, the error is clear even so.",
        "In the first column, we show the summary phrase in question.",
        "In the second column, we show the document phrase to which it should be aligned, and in the third column, we show the document phrase that our model aligned it to (or null).",
        "In the right column, we classify the model’s alignment as incorrect or partially correct.",
        "The errors shown in Table 5 show several weaknesses of the model.",
        "For instance, in the first example, it aligns to port with to port, which seems correct without context, but the chosen occurrence of to port in the document is in the discussion of a completely different porting process than that referred to in the summary (and is",
        "Ten example phrase alignments from the hand-annotated corpus; the last column indicates whether the semi-HMM correctly aligned this phrase.",
        "several sentences away).",
        "The seventh and tenth examples (The new software and Oracle Corp., respectively) show instances of the coreference error that occurs commonly."

        "Currently, summarization systems are limited to either using hand-annotated data or using weak alignment models at the granularity of sentences, which serve as suitable training data only for sentence extraction systems.",
        "To train more advanced extraction systems, such as those used in document compression models or in next-generation abstraction models, we need to better understand the lexical correspondences between documents and their human written abstracts.",
        "Our work is motivated by the desire to leverage the vast number of (document, abstract) pairs that are freely available on the Internet and in other collections and to create word and phrase-aligned (document, abstract) corpora automatically.",
        "This article presents a statistical model for learning such alignments in a completely unsupervised manner.",
        "The model is based on an extension of a hidden Markov model, in which multiple emissions are made in the course of one transition.",
        "We have described efficient algorithms in this framework, all based on dynamic programming.",
        "Using this framework, we have experimented with complex models of movement and lexical correspondences.",
        "Unlike the approaches used in machine translation, where only very simple models are used, we have shown how to efficiently and effectively leverage such disparate knowledge sources and WordNet, syntax trees, and identity models.",
        "We have empirically demonstrated that our model is able to learn the complex structure of (document, abstract) pairs.",
        "Our system outperforms competing approaches, including the standard machine translation alignment models (Brown et al.",
        "1993; Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and the state-of-the-art Cut and Paste summary alignment technique (Jing 2002).",
        "We have analyzed two sources of error in our model, including issues of null-generated summary words and lexical identity.",
        "Within the model itself, we have already suggested two major sources of error in our alignment procedure.",
        "Clearly more work needs to be done to fix these problems.",
        "One approach that we believe will be particularly fruitful would be to add a fifth model to the linearly interpolated rewrite model based on lists of synonyms automatically extracted from large corpora.",
        "Additionally,",
        " investigating the possibility of including some sort of weak coreference knowledge into the model might serve to help with the second class of errors made by the model.",
        "One obvious aspect of our method that may reduce its general usefulness is the computation time.",
        "In fact, we found that despite the efficient dynamic programming algorithms available for this model, the state space and output alphabet are simply so large and complex that we were forced to first map documents down to extracts before we could process them (and even so, computation took roughly 1,000 processor hours).",
        "Though we have not pursued it in this work, we do believe that there is room for improvement computationally, as well.",
        "One obvious first approach would be to run a simpler model for the first iteration (for example, Model 1 from machine translation (Brown et al.",
        "1993), which tends to be very recall oriented) and use this to see subsequent iterations of the more complex model.",
        "By doing so, one could recreate the extracts at each iteration using the previous iteration’s parameters to make better and shorter extracts.",
        "Similarly, one might only allow summary words to align to words found in their corresponding extract sentences, which would serve to significantly speed up training and, combined with the parameterized extracts, might not hurt performance.",
        "A final option, but one that we do not advocate, would be to give up on phrases and train the model in a word-to-word fashion.",
        "This could be coupled with heuristic phrasal creation as is done in machine translation (Och and Ney 2000), but by doing this, one completely loses the probabilistic interpretation that makes this model so pleasing.",
        "Aside from computational considerations, the most obvious future effort along the lines of this model is to incorporate it into a full document summarization system.",
        "Since this can be done in many ways, including training extraction systems, compression systems, headline generation systems, and even extraction systems, we left this to future work so that we could focus specifically on the alignment task in this article.",
        "Nevertheless, the true usefulness of this model will be borne out by its application to true summarization tasks."
