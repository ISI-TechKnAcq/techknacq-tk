        "This paper presents a method for identifying non-English speech, with the aim of supporting an automated speech proficiency scoring system for non-native speakers.",
        "The method uses a popular technique from the language identification domain, a single phone recognizer followed by multiple language-dependent language models.",
        "This method determines the language of a speech sample based on the phonotactic differences among languages.",
        "The method is intended for use with non-native English speakers.",
        "Therefore, the method must be able to distinguish non-English responses from non-native speakers' English responses.",
        "This makes the task more challenging, as the frequent pronunciation errors of non-native speakers may weaken the phonetic and phonotactic distinction between English responses and non-English responses.",
        "In order to address this issue, the speaking rate measure was used to complement the language identification based features in the model.",
        "The accuracy of the method was 98%, and there was 45% relative error reduction over a system based on the conventional language identification technique.",
        "The model using both feature sets furthermore demonstrated an improvement in accuracy for speakers at all English proficiency levels."

        "We developed a non-English response identification method as a supplementary module for the automated speech proficiency scoring of non-native speakers.",
        "The method can identify speech samples of test takers who try to game the system by speaking in their native languages.",
        "For the items that elicited spontaneous speech, fluency features such as speaking rate have been one of the most important features in the automated scoring.",
        "By speaking in their native languages, speakers can generate fluent speech, and the automated proficiency scoring system may assign a high score.",
        "This problem has been rarely recognized, and none of research has focused on it as to the authors' knowledge.",
        "In order to address this issue, the automated proficiency scoring system in this study first filters out the responses in non-English languages, and for the remaining responses, it predicts the proficiency score using a scoring model.",
        "Non-English detection is strongly related to language identification(Lamel and Gauvain, 1993; Zissman, 1996; Li et al., 2007); language identification is the process of determining which language a spoken response is in, while non-English detection makes a binary decision whether the spoken response is in English or not.",
        "Due to the strong similarity between the two tasks, the language identification method was used here for non-English response detection.",
        "In contrast to previous research, the method described here was intended for use with non-native speakers, and the English responses for model training and evaluation were accordingly collected from non-native speakers.",
        "Among other differences, non-native speakers' speech tends to display nonstandard pronunciation characteristics which can make the task of language identification more challenging.",
        "For instance, when native Korean speakers speak English, they may replace some English phonemes not in their language with their native phones, and epenthesize vowels within consonant clusters.",
        "Such processes tend to reduce the phonetic and phonotactic distinction between English and other languages.",
        "The frequency of these pronunciation errors is influenced by speakers' native language and proficiency level, with lower-proficiency speakers likely to exhibit the greatest degree of divergence from standard pronunciation.",
        "Language identification method may not effectively distinguish non-fluent speakers' English responses from non-English responses.",
        "In order to address these non-native speech characteristics, the model described here includes the speaking rate feature, which has been found to be an indicator of speaking proficiency in previous research(Strik and Cuc-chiarini, 1999; Zechner et al., 2009).",
        "Non-fluent speakers' English responses can be distinguished from non-English responses by slow speaking rate.",
        "This paper will proceed as follows: we first review previous studies in section 2, then describe the data in section 3, and present the experiment in section 4.",
        "The results and discussion are presented in section 5, and the conclusions are presented in section 6."

      "text": [
        "Many previous studies in language identification focused on phonetic and phonotactic differences among languages.",
        "The frequencies of phones and phone sequences differ according to languages and some phone sequences occur only in certain languages.",
        "The literature in language identification captured this characteristic using the likelihood score of speech recognizers, which signals the degree of a match between the test sentences and speech recognizer models.",
        "Both the language model (hereafter, LM) and acoustic model (hereafter, AM) of a phone recognizer are optimized for the acoustic characteristics and the phoneme distribution of the training data.",
        "If a spoken response is recognized using a recognizer trained on a different language, it may result in a low likelihood score due to a mismatch between the test sentences and the models.",
        "Lamel and Gauvain (1993) trained multiple language-dependent-phone-recognizers and selected the language with the highest matching score as the input language (hereafter, parallel PRLM).",
        "For instance, if the test data contained English and Hindi speech data, the English-phone-recognizer and the Hindi-phone-recognizer were trained independently.",
        "In the test, the given speech samples were recognized using two phone recognizers, and the language that had a higher matching score was selected.",
        "However, training multiple phone recognizers was time-consuming and labor intensive; therefore, Zissman (1996) proposed a system using single-language phone recognition followed by multiple language-dependent language modeling (hereafter, PRLM).",
        "PRLM was able to achieve comparable performance to parallel PRLM for long speech (longer than 30 seconds), and in a two-language situation, the error rate was between 5 and 7%.",
        "Instead of language-dependent LM, Li et al.",
        "(2007) used vector space modeling (VSM).",
        "They applied metrics frequently used in information retrieval.",
        "As with the PRLM method, the speech was converted into phone sequences using the phone recognizer, and cooccurrence statistics such as term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) were calculated.",
        "The method outperformed the PRLM approach for long speech.",
        "These methods can be challenging and time-consuming to implement, as they require implementation of methods beyond those typically available in a standard word-based recognition system.",
        "In particular, the application of the phone recognizer increases the processing time substantially.",
        "Because of this problem, Lim et al.",
        "(2004) presented a method based on the features that were readily available for speech recognizers: a confidence score and the cross-entropy of the LM.",
        "The confidence scoring method measured the acoustic match between the word hypotheses and the real sound, while the cross-entropy measured how well a sentence matched a given language model.",
        "If the test sentence was recognized by the speech recognizer in a different language, the phonetic and lexical mismatches between two languages resulted in a low confidence score and a high cross-entropy.",
        "Using this methodology, Lim et al.",
        "(2004) achieved 99.8% accuracy in their threeway classification task.",
        "The current study can be distinguished from the previous studies in the following points.",
        "First of all, special features were implemented to model non-native speech since the method was developed for non-native speech.",
        "In our study, the data contained non-native speakers' English speech, characterized by inaccurate pronunciation.",
        "It resulted in a mismatch between the speech-recognizer models and test sentences, even for utterances in English.",
        "In particular, the mismatch was more salient in non-fluent speakers' speech, which comprised a high proportion of our data.",
        "In order to address this issue, speaking rate, which has achieved good performance in the estimation of non-native speakers' speaking proficiency (Strik and Cucchiarini, 1999; Zechner et al., 2009), was implemented as an additional feature.",
        "Secondly, in contrast to previous studies that determined which language the speech was in, we made a binary decision whether the speech was in English or not.",
        "Finally, the method was developed as part of a language assessment system.",
        "The OGI Multi-language corpus (Muthusamy et al., 1992), a standard language identification development data set, was used in the training and evaluation of the system.",
        "It contains a total of 1,957 calls from speakers of 10 different languages (English, Farsi, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Tamil, and Vietnamese).",
        "The corpus was composed of short speech and long speech; the short files contained approximately 10 seconds speech, while the long files contained speech ranged from 30 seconds to 50 seconds.",
        "The method described here was implemented to distinguish non-English responses from non-native speakers' English responses.",
        "Therefore, the English data used to train and evaluate the model for non-English response detection was collected from non-native speakers.",
        "In particular, responses to the English Practice Test (EPT) were used.",
        "The EPT is an online practice test which allows students to gain familiarity with the format of a high-stakes test of English proficiency and receive immediate feedback on their test responses based on automated scoring methods.",
        "The speaking section of the EPT assessment consists of 6 items in which speakers are prompted to provide open-ended responses of 45-60 seconds in length.",
        "The scoring scale of each item is discrete from 1 to 4, where 4 indicates high speaking proficiency and 1 low proficiency.",
        "The non-English detection task is composed of two major components: training of PRLM, and training of the classifier which makes a binary decision about whether a speech sample is in the English language, given PRLM-based features and the speaking rate.",
        "The OGI corpus was used in training of both PRLM and the classifier; a total of 9,033 short files from the OGI corpus were used in PRLM training, and 158 long files were used in classifier training.",
        "(The small number of long files in the OGI corpus limited the number of samples comparable in length to our English-language data described below, so that only these 158 OGI samples could be used in classifier training and evaluation.)",
        "For English, only short samples were selected for use in this experiment.",
        "In addition, a total of 3,021 EPT responses were used in classifier training.",
        "As the English proficiency levels of speakers may have an influence on the accuracy of non-English response detection, the EPT responses were selected to include similar numbers of responses for each score level.",
        "Responses were classified into four groups according to their proficiency scores and 1000 responses were randomly selected from each group.",
        "For score 1 and 4, where the number of available responses was smaller than 1000, all available responses were selected.",
        "Ultimately, 156 responses for score 1, 1000 responses for score 2 and score 3, and 865 responses for score 4 were selected.",
        "The resultant training and evaluation data sets are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Due to the lack of non-Engilsh responses in EPT data, 158 non-English utterances in OGI data were used in both training and evaluation of non-English detection.",
        "EPT responses were collected from many different countries, and speakers with 75 different native languages were participated in the data collection.",
        "Due to the large variations, many of their native languages were not covered by OGI data.",
        "However, all 9 languages in OGI data were in top 15 L1 languages and covered approximately 60% of speakers' native languages."

        "Due to the efficiency in processing time and implementation, a PRLM was implemented instead of a parallel PRLM.",
        "However, the difference between PRLM and parallel PRLM in this study may not be significant since PRLM has been shown to be comparable to parallel PRLM for test samples longer than 30 seconds, and the duration of test instances in this study was longer than 30 seconds.",
        "In addition to PRLM, speaking rate was calculated as a feature.",
        "The PRLM based method in this study is composed of three parts: training of a phone recognizer, training of language-dependent LMs, and generation of PRLM-based features.",
        "In contrast to the conventional language identification approach that only focused on identifying the language with the highest matching score, 6 additional features were implemented to capture the difference between English model and other models.",
        "Phone recognizer: An English triphone acoustic model was trained on 30 hours of non-native English speech (EPT data) using the HTK toolkit (Young et al., 2002).",

        "Due to the difference in the sampling rate of EPT (11,025 Hz) and the OGI corpus (8,000 Hz), the EPT data was down-sampled to 8,000 Hz and the acoustic model was trained using the down-sampled data.",
        "In order to avoid the influence of English in phone hypothesis generation, a triphone bigram language model with a uniform probability distribution was used as the LM.",

        "The phone recognition accuracy rate was 42.7% on the 94 held-out EPT test samples.",

        "In this study, we presented a non-English response detection method for non-native speakers' speech.",
        "A decision tree model was trained using PRLM-based features and speaking rate.",
        "The method was intended for use as a supplementary module of an automated speech proficiency scoring system.",
        "The characteristics of non-native English speech (frequent pronunciation errors) reduced the phonetic distinction between English responses and non-English responses, and correspondingly, the differences between the feature values for non-English and English speech decreased as well.",
        "In order to address this issue, a speaking rate feature was added to the model.",
        "This feature was specialized for second language (L2) learners' speech, as speaking rate has previously proved useful in estimating non-native speakers' speaking proficiency.",
        "In contrast to PRLM-based features, the speaking rate feature showed increasing discrimination between non-English and English speech samples as speakers' proficiency level decreased.",
        "The complementary relationship between PRLM-based features and speaking rate led to an improvement in the model when these features were combined.",
        "Improvements resulting from the combined feature set extended across speakers at all proficiency levels studied in the context of this paper.",
        "The speaking rate becomes less effective if test takers speak slowly in their native languages.",
        "However, the test takers are unlikely to use this strategy, since it will result in a low score although they can game the system.",
        "Due to lack of non-English responses in EPT data, non-English utterances were extracted from OGI data.",
        "Since the features in this study were not directly related to acoustic scores, the acoustic differences between EPT and OGI data may not give significant impact on the results.",
        "However, in order to avoid any influence by differences between corpora, the non-English responses will be collected using EPT setup and the evaluation will be performed using new data in future."
