        "Syntactic ellipsis – the non-expression of syntactically obligatory elements – has been widely studied in computational (not to mention other branches of) linguistics, largely because accounting for missing syntactic elements is a crucial aspect of achieving a full parse, and parsing is required for many approaches to NLP.1 Much less attention has been devoted to what we will call semantic ellipsis, or the non-expression of elements that, while not syntactically obligatory, are required for a full semantic interpretation of a text.2 Naturally, semantic ellipsis is important only in truly knowledge-rich ap",

        "But even if a text is devoid of syntactic gaps, much remains below the surface, easily interpretable by people but not directly observable.",
        "Typical examples of semantically underspecified elements are pronouns and indexicals (e.g., here, now, yesterday), whose real-world anchors must be clarified in a fully developed semantic representation (i.e., yesterday has a concrete meaning only if one knows when today is).",
        "Pronouns and indexicals, though often difficult to resolve, have one advantage over the cases to be discussed here: the trigger that further semantic specification need be carried out is the word itself, and the inventory of such words is well known.",

        "However, the scope of reference-related problems is actually much broader (see, e.g., McShane and Nirenburg 2002 and McShane forthcoming).",
        "In this section we describe a number of cases in which reference resolution requires knowledge of semantically elided categories.",
        "That is, we are not talking simply about recovering a semantically elided category in its own right, we are talking about recovering it in order to support the correct analysis of another category in the text.",
        "Consider the challenge of resolving the reference of those in example (1): After boosting employment the past few years, Aluminum Co. of America won't be doing any hiring this fall beyond replacing those who leave.",
        "‘Those’ refers to an unspecified set of employees.",
        "The ellipsis of the head noun employees (or any synonym of it) is licensed by the fact that the notion of ‘employees’ is implicitly introduced into the discourse by the use of the word hire in the preceding clause (in the way described below).",
        "The real-world set of employees instantiated by the verb hire is not the same as the real-world set of employees referred to by the “those” NP.",
        "However, as this corpus-derived example shows, coreference at the level of concepts rather than instances can, in fact, license ellipsis.3 Most reference resolution programs rely on shallow, stochastic methods and limit potential antecedents to overt textual elements; such programs would fail to resolve this case of reference.",
        "The OntoSem reference resolution programs, by contrast, include ontological knowledge in the search space of antecedents and, accordingly, can resolve such references.",
        "To make clear how this is done, a few more words about ontological specification and TMRs are necessary.",
        "Fillers of properties in the OntoSem ontology can be concepts, literals, numbers or ranges of numbers.",

        "fault filler(s), if any (i.e., this is more tightly constrained than sem); and relaxable-to, which shows acceptable relaxation of typical selectional restrictions.",
        "So, whereas the most typical AGENT of hiring is somebody in a business role (children of BUSINESS-ROLE include MANAGER, CHAIRMAN, VP-CORPORATION and others) it is perfectly normal for any person in a social role to hire someone (e.g., I, as a homeowner, can hire a gardener), and even corporations can be metonymically said to hire people.",
        "As concerns the THEME of hiring, it is always a person in a social role, and no defaults or extensions to that specification are required.",
        "(Note that SOCIAL-ROLE is a child of HUMAN in the ontology.)",
        "When a concept is instantiated in a TMR, its entire description becomes part of the TMR, and any property fillers actually provided by the text are indicated using the value facet.",
        "Fillers on the value facet are appended with an instance number, just like the main concept being instantiated.",

        "The OntoSem algorithm for resolving the reference of those can be briefly outlined as follows: 1.",
        "From the list of candidate antecedents that is generated during the processing of each sentence, exclude those with incompatible grammatical features (in this case, those in the singular).",
        "2 Compare potential antecedents using (a) weighted heuristics of the same type as are used in most stochastic reference resolution programs, based on features such as text distance, grammatical function, etc, and (b) comparison of the semantic similarity between those (as suggested by the selectional restrictions imposed by its selecting verb) and each antecedent.",
        "The two key differences between our approach and stochastic ones are that, for us, semantic comparison is a heavily weighted heuristic, and implicit properties of TMR-instantiated concepts are accessible in the search space.",

        "Interpreting this phrase relies primarily on semantics, i.e., an understanding that the graduates are coreferential with the semantically elided object of hire.",

        "The type of work presented in this paper might be termed a practical, progressive long-term effort.",
        "The work is practical because it is being carried out within a working system that: (a) uses non-toy, real text-oriented knowledge resources – lexical and ontological – that are being built not in the hope that someday some system might be able to use them, but because they are useful right now in the system under construction; (b) has processors that cover all levels of text analysis, from preprocessing raw input text to creating semantic text-meaning representations of it; (c) has been and continues to be used in applications as diverse as machine translation, information extraction, summarization and question answering.",
        "In short, the work that we carry out on any given aspect of text processing answers a need encountered in real applications, and does so in a concrete, implemented and further implementable way.",
        "The work is progressive in the sense that the loop of algorithm development and integration in each new version of the working system is continuous.",
        "We find it important, tactically, to view issues in natural language from a broad perspective first, with development of practical “microtheories” for their treatment progressing as need demands and resources permit.",
        "What we try not to do is artificially exclude from our purview those aspects of phenomena that are not easily treated at the present state of the art.",
        "Instead, we include such aspects in our algorithms to the degree possible and make sure that they are modified as soon as an advance is made in resource acquisition or algorithm fusion (e.g., incorporating stochastic methods if and when knowledge-based ones fail to produce a single, unambiguous semantic representation, as in the case of weighted heuristics for reference resolution).",
        "The work is long term because we know that high-quality text processing cannot be achieved in the short term.",
        "If a phenomenon exists in a language we are processing, it is, by definition, within our purview.",
        "Our ultimate aim: an intelligent agent able to communicate no less fluently than you or I and in possession of human-level background knowledge about the world and language.",
        "Of course, this goal will not be realized in our lifetimes, unless adequate resources are allocated to this task and its subtasks.",
        "However, a solid foundation that in principle can accommodate any and all later needs of language processing is what we are attempting to develop while at the same time developing working applications."
