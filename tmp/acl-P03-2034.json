        "This paper demonstrates a multimodal interface for asking questions and retrieving a set of likely answers.",
        "Such an interface is particularly appropriate for mobile networked devices with screens that are too small to display general Web pages and documents.",
        "Palm and Pocket PC devices, whose screens commonly display 10–15 lines, are candidates.",
        "Schofield and Kubin (2002) argue that for such devices question-answering is more appropriate than traditional document retrieval.",
        "But until recently no method has existed for inputting questions in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "The study of Schofield (2003) concludes that questions tend to have a limited lexical structure that can be exploited for accurate speech recognition or text prediction.",
        "In this demonstration we test whether this result can endow a real spoken question answering system with acceptable precision."

        "Kupiec and others (1994) at Xerox labs built one of the earliest spoken information retrieval systems, with a speaker-dependent isolated-word speech recognizer and an electronic encyclopedia.",
        "One reason they reported for the success of their system was their use of simple language models to exploit the observation that pairs of words co-occurring in a document source are likely to be spoken together as keywords in a query.",
        "Later research at CMU built upon similar intuition by deriving the language-model of their Sphinx-II speech recognizer from the searched document source.",
        "Colineau and others (1999) developed a system as a part of the THISL project for retrieval from broadcast news to respond to news-related queries such as What do you have on ... ?",
        "and I am doing a report on... – can you help me?",
        "The queries the authors addressed had a simple structure, and they successfully modelled them in two parts: a question-frame, for which they hand-wrote grammar rules; and a content-bearing string of keywords, for which they fitted standard lexical language-models from the news collection.",
        "Extensive research (Garofolo et al., 2000;Allan, 2001) has concluded that spoken documents can be effectively indexed and searched with word-error rates as high as 30–40%.",
        "One might expect a much higher sensitivity to recognition errors with a short query or natural-language question.",
        "Two studies (et al., 1997; Crestani, 2002) have measured the detrimental effect of speech recognition errors on the precision of document retrieval and found that this task can be somewhat robust to 25% word-error rates for queries of 2–8 words.",
        "Two recent systems are worthy of special mention.",
        "First, Google Labs deployed a speaker-independent system in late 2001 as a demo of a telephone-interface to its popular search engine.",
        "(It is still live as of April 2003.)",
        "Second, Chang and others (2002a; 2002b) have implemented systems for the Pocket PC that interpret queries spoken in English or Chinese.",
        "This last group appears to be at the forefront of current research in spoken interfaces for document retrieval.",
        "None of the above are question-answering systems; they boil utterances down to strings of keywords, discarding any other information, and return only lists of matching documents.",
        "To our knowledge automatic answering of spoken natural-language questions has not previously been attempted."

        "We performed tests with a head-mounted microphone in a relatively quiet acoustic environment.",
        "(The Dragon Audio Setup Wizard identified the signal-to-noise ratio as 22 dBs.)",
        "We tested a male native speaker of English and a female non-native speaker, requesting each first to train the acoustic models with 5–10 minutes of software-prompted dictation.",
        "We also trained the language models by presenting the Vocabulary Wizard the corpus of 280,000 questions described in (Schofield, 2003), of which Table 1 contains a random sample.",
        "The primary function of this training feature in NaturallySpeaking is to add new words to the lexicon; the nature of the other adaptations is not clearly documented.",
        "New 2-grams and 3-grams also appear to be identified, which one would expect to reduce the word-error rate by increasing the ‘hit rate’ over the 30– 50% of 3-grams in a new text for which a language model typically has explicit frequency estimates."

        "We fitted a 3-gram language model to the same corpus as above using the CMU–Cambridge SLM Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997).",
        "The interface in our demo is a thin JavaScript client accessible from a Web browser that intercepts each keystroke and performs a CGI request for an updated list of predictions.",

        "We describe these in turn.",
        "Later we propose other modifications that we believe would increase robustness to a speech interface.",
        "Speed The original engine took several seconds to answer each question, which may be too slow in a spoken interface or on a mobile device after factoring in the additional computational overhead of decoding the speech and the longer latency in mobile data networks.",
        "We have now implemented a multilevel caching system to increase speed.",
        "Our cache system currently contains two levels.",

        "If a Web document is in the cache and has not expired the system will use it instead of connecting to the remote site.",
        "By ‘semi-structured’ we mean that we cache semi-parsed sentences rather than the original HTML document.",
        "We will discuss some technical issues, like how and how often to update the cache and how to use hash tables for fast access, in another paper.",
        "Output The original engine provided a list of sentences as hyperlinks to the source documents.",
        "This is convenient for Web users but should be transformed for spoken output.",
        "It now offers plain text as an alternative to HTML for output.",

        "This paper has described a multimodal interface to a question-answering system designed for rapid input of questions and correction of speech recognition errors.",

        "We described a small evaluation of the system’s accuracy given raw (uncorrected) transcribed questions from two speakers, which indicates that speech can be used for automatic question-answering, but that an interface for correcting misrecognitions is probably necessary for acceptable accuracy.",
        "In the future we will continue tightening the integration of the components of the system and port the interface to phones and Palm or Pocket PC devices."
