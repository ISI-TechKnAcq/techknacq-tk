        "These methods typically assume that a segmentation algorithm has access not only to acoustic input, but also to its transcript.",
        "This assumption is natural for applications where the transcript has to be computed as part ofthe system output, or it is readily available from other system components.",
        "However, for some domains and languages, the transcripts may not be available, or the recognition performance may not be adequate to achieve reliable segmentation.",
        "In order to process such data, we need a method for topic segmentation that does not require transcribed input.",
        "In this paper, we explore a method for topic segmentation that operates directly on a raw acoustic speech signal, without using any input transcripts.",
        "This method predicts topic changes by analyzing the distribution of reoccurring acoustic patterns in the speech signal corresponding to a single speaker.",
        "In the same way that unsupervised segmentation algorithms predict boundaries based on changes in lexical distribution, our algorithm is driven by changes in the distribution of acoustic patterns.",
        "The central hypothesis here is that similar sounding acoustic sequences produced by the same speaker correspond to similar lexicographic sequences.",
        "Thus, by analyzing the distribution of acoustic patterns we could approximate a traditional content analysis based on the lexical distribution of words in a transcript.",

        "Moreover, in the absence of higher-level knowledge, information about word boundaries is not always discernible from the raw acoustic input.",
        "This causes problems because we have no obvious unit of comparison.",
        "Finally, noise inherent in the acoustic matching procedure complicates the detection of distributional changes in the comparison matrix.",

        "Speech-based Topic Segmentation A variety of supervised and unsupervised methods have been employed to segment speech input.",
        "Some of these algorithms have been originally developed for processing written text (Beeferman etal., 1999).",
        "Others are specifically adapted for processing speech input by adding relevant acoustic features such as pause length and speaker change (Galley et al., 2003; Dielmann and Renals, 2005).",
        "In parallel, researchers extensively study the relationship between discourse structure and intonational variation (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Shriberg et al., 2000).",
        "However, all of the existing segmentation methods require as input a speech transcript of reasonable quality.",
        "In contrast, the method presented in this paper does not assume the availability of transcripts, which prevents us from using segmentation algorithms developed for written text.",
        "At the same time, our work is closely related to unsupervised approaches for text segmentation.",
        "The central assumption here is that sharp changes in lexical distribution signal the presence of topic boundaries (Hearst, 1994; Choi et al., 2001).",
        "These approaches determine segment boundaries by identifying homogeneous regions within a similarity matrix that encodes pairwise similarity between textual units, such as sentences.",
        "Our segmentation algorithm operates over a distortion matrix, but the unit of comparison is the speech signal over a time interval.",
        "This change in representation gives rise to multiple challenges related to the inherent noise of acoustic matching, and requires the development of new methods for signal discretization, interval comparison and matrix analysis.",

        "They induce the vocabulary from the audio stream directly, avoiding the need for phonetic transcription.",
        "Their method can accurately discover words which appear with high frequency in the audio stream.",
        "While the results obtained by Park and Glass inspire our approach, we cannot directly use their output as proxies for words in topic segmentation.",
        "Many of the content words occurring only a few times in the text are pruned away by this method.",
        "Our results show that this data that is too sparse and noisy for robustly discerning changes in lexical distribution.",
        "3 Algorithm",
        "The audio-based segmentation algorithm identifies topic boundaries by analyzing changes in the distribution of acoustic patterns.",
        "The analysis is performed in three steps.",
        "First, we identify recurring patterns in the audio stream and compute distortion between them (Section 3.1).",
        "These acoustic patterns correspond to high-frequency words and phrases, but they only cover a fraction of the words that appear in the input.",
        "As a result, the distributional profile obtained during this process is too sparse to deliver robust topic analysis.",
        "Second, we generate an acoustic comparison matrix that aggregates information from multiple pattern matches (Section 3.2).",
        "Additional matrix transformations during this step reduce the noise and irregularities inherent in acoustic matching.",
        "Third, we partition the matrix to identify segments with a homogeneous distribution of acoustic patterns (Section 3.3).",
        "Given a raw acoustic waveform, we extract a set of acoustic patterns that occur frequently in the speech document.",
        "Continuous speech includes many word sequences that lack clear low-level acoustic cues to denote word boundaries.",
        "Therefore, we cannot perform this task through simple counting of speech segments separated by silence.",
        "Instead, we use a local alignment algorithm to search for similar speech segments and quantify the amount of distortion between them.",
        "In what follows, we first present a vector representation used in this computation, and then specify the alignment algorithm that finds similar segments.",
        "MFCC Representation We start by transforming the acoustic signal into a vector representation that facilitates the comparison of acoustic sequences.",
        "First, we perform silence detection on the original waveform by registering a pause if the energy falls below a certain threshold for a duration of 2s.",
        "This enables us to break up the acoustic stream into continuous spoken utterances.",
        "This step is necessary as it eliminates spurious alignments between silent regions of the acoustic waveform.",
        "Note that silence detection is not equivalent to word boundary detection, as segmentation by silence detection alone only accounts for 20% of word boundaries in our corpus.",
        "Next, we convert each utterance into a time series of vectors consisting of Mel-scale cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).",
        "This compact low-dimensional representation is commonly used in speech processing applications because it approximates human auditory models.",
        "The process ofextracting MFCCs from the speech signal can be summarized as follows.",
        "First, the 16 kHz digitized audio waveform is normalized by removing the mean and scaling the peak amplitude.",
        "Next, the short-time Fourier transform is taken at a frame interval of 10 ms using a 25.6 ms Hamming window.",
        "The spectral energy from the Fourier transform is then weighted by Mel-frequency filters (Huang et al., 2001).",
        "Finally, the discrete cosine transform of the log of these Mel-frequency spectral coefficients is computed, yielding a series of 14-dimensional MFCC vectors.",
        "We take the additional step of whitening the feature vectors, which normalizes the variance and decorrelates the dimensions of the feature vectors (Bishop, 1995).",
        "This whitened spectral representation enables us to use the standard unweighted Euclidean distance metric.",
        "After this transformation, the distances in each dimension will be uncorrelated and have equal variance.",
        "Alignment Now, our goal is to identify acoustic patterns that occur multiple times in the audio waveform.",
        "The patterns may not be repeated exactly, but will most likely reoccur in varied forms.",
        "We capture this information by extracting pairs of patterns with an associated distortion score.",
        "The computation is performed using a sequence alignment algorithm.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of alignments automatically computed by our algorithm.",
        "The corresponding phonetic transcriptions demonstrate that the matching procedure can robustly handle variations in pronunciations.",
        "For example, two instances ofthe word \"direction\" are matched to one another despite different pronunciations, (\"d ay\" vs. \"d ax\" in the first syllable).",

        "Given two input utterances u' and u'', the algorithm outputs a set of alignments between the corresponding MFCC vectors.",
        "The alignment distortion score is computed by summing the Euclidean distances of matching vectors.",
        "To compute the optimal alignment we use a variant of the dynamic time warping algorithm (Huang et al., 2001).",
        "For every possible starting alignment point, we optimize the following dynamic programming objective:",
        "During the search process, we consider not only the alignment distortion score, but also the shape of the alignment path.",

        "Moreover, many of these paths are not disjoint.",

        "Matrix Smoothing Equipped with a block distortion measure, we can now construct an acoustic comparison matrix.",
        "In principle, this matrix can be processed employing standard methods developed for text segmentation.",
        "However, as Figure 1 illustrates, the structure of the acoustic matrix is quite different from the one obtained from text.",
        "In a transcript similarity matrix shown in Figure 1 a), reference boundaries delimit homogeneous regions with high internal similarity.",
        "On the other hand, looking at the acoustic similarity matrix shown in Figure 1 b), it is difficult to observe any block structure corresponding to the reference segmentation.",
        "This deficiency can be attributed to the sparsity of acoustic alignments.",
        "Consider, for example, the case when a segment is interspersed with blocks that contain very few or no complete paths.",
        "Even though the rest of the blocks in the segment could be closely related, these path-free blocks dilute segment homogeneity.",
        "This is problematic because it is not always possible to tell whether a sudden shift in scores signifies a transition or if it is just an artifact of irregularities in acoustic matching.",
        "Without additional matrix processing, these irregularities will lead the system astray.",
        "We further refine the acoustic comparison matrix using anisotropic diffusion.",
        "This technique has been developed for enhancing edge detection accuracy in image processing (Perona and Malik, 1990), and has been shown to be an effective smoothing method in text segmentation (Ji and Zha, 2003).",
        "When applied to a comparison matrix, anisotropic diffusion reduces score variability within homogeneous regions of the matrix and makes edges between these regions more pronounced.",
        "Consequently, this transformation facilitates boundary detection, potentially increasing segmentation accuracy.",
        "In Figure 1 c), we can observe that the boundary structure in the diffused comparison matrix becomes more salient and corresponds more closely to the reference segmentation.",
        "Given a target number of segments k, the goal of the partitioning step is to divide a matrix into k square submatrices along the diagonal.",
        "This process is guided by an optimization function that maximizes the homogeneity within a segment or minimizes the homogeneity across segments.",
        "This optimization problem can be solved using one of many unsupervised segmentation approaches (Choi et al., 2001; Ji and Zha, 2003; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "In our implementation, we employ the minimumcut segmentation algorithm (Shi and Malik, 2000; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "In this graph-theoretic framework, segmentation is cast as a problem of partitioning a weighted undirected graph that minimizes the normalized-cut criterion.",
        "The minimum-cut method achieves robust analysis by jointly considering all possible partitionings of a document, moving beyond localized decisions.",
        "This allows us to aggregate comparisons from multiple locations, thereby compensating for the noise of individual matches."

        "The segmentation algorithm presented in this paper focuses on one source of linguistic information for discourse analysis – lexical cohesion.",
        "Multiple studies of discourse structure, however, have shown that prosodic cues are highly predictive of changes in topic structure (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Shriberg et al., 2000).",
        "In a supervised framework, we can further enhance audio-based segmentation by combining features derived from pattern analysis with prosodic information.",
        "We can also explore an unsupervised fusion of these two sources of information; for instance, we can induce informative prosodic cues by using distributional evidence.",
        "Another interesting direction for future research lies in combining the results of noisy recognition with information obtained from distribution of acoustic patterns.",
        "We hypothesize that these two sources provide complementary information about the audio stream, and therefore can compensate for each other's mistakes.",
        "This combination can be particularly fruitful when processing speech documents with multiple speakers or background noise."
