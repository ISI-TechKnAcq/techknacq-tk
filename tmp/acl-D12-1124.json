        "When a customer writes an unfavorable review of a restaurant, how is her word choice affected by the restaurant's prices?",
        "In this paper, we explore questions like these that relate restaurant menus, prices, and customer sentiment.",
        "Our goal is to understand how language is used in the food domain, and we direct our investigation using external variables such as restaurant menu prices.",
        "We build on a thread of NLP research that seeks linguistic understanding by predicting real-world quantities from text data.",
        "Recent examples include prediction of stock volatility (Kogan et al. 2009) and movie revenues (Joshi et al. 2010).",
        "There, prediction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation and objective model comparison, while analysis of learned models gave insight about the social process behind the data.",
        "We echo this pattern here as we turn our attention to language use on restaurant menus and in user restaurant reviews.",
        "We use data from a large corpus of restaurant menus and reviews crawled from the web and formulate several prediction tasks.",
        "In addition to predicting menu prices, we also consider predicting sentiment along with price.",
        "The relationship between language and sentiment is an active area of investigation (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Much of this research has focused on customer-written reviews of goods and services, and perspectives have been gained on how sentiment is expressed in this type of informal text.",
        "In addition to sentiment, however, other variables are reflected in a reviewer's choice of words, such as the price of the item under consideration.",
        "In this paper, we take a step toward joint modeling of multiple variables in review text, exploring connections between price and sentiment in restaurant reviews.",
        "Hence this paper contributes an exploratory data",
        "analysis of language used to describe food (by its purveyors and by its consumers).",

        "There are several areas of related work scattered throughout linguistics, NLP, hospitality research, and economics.",
        "Freedman and Jurafsky (2011) studied the use of language in food advertising, specifically the words on potato chip bags.",
        "They argued that, due to the ubiquity of food writing across cultures, ethnic groups, and social classes, studying the use of language for describing food can provide perspective on how different socioeconomic groups self-identify using language and how they are linguistically targeted.",
        "In particular, they showed that price affects how ?authenticity?",
        "is realized in marketing language, a point we return to in ?5.",
        "This is an example of how price can affect how an underlying variable is expressed in language.",
        "Among other explorations in this paper, we consider how price interacts with expression of sentiment in user reviews of restaurants.",
        "As mentioned above, our work is related to research in predicting real-world quantities using text data (Koppel and Shtrimberg, 2006; Ghose et al. 2007; Lerman et al. 2008; Kogan et al. 2009; Joshi et al. 2010; Eisenstein et al. 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2011; Yogatama et al. 2011).",
        "Like much of this prior work, we aim to learn how language is used in a specific context while building models that achieve competitive performance on a quantitative prediction task.",
        "Along these lines, there is recent interest in exploring the relationship between product sales and user-generated text, particularly online product reviews.",
        "For example, Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011) studied the sales impact of particular properties of review text, such as readability, the presence of spelling errors, and the balance between subjective and objective statements.",
        "Archak et al(2011) had a similar goal but decomposed user reviews into parts describing particular aspects of the product being reviewed (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Our paper differs from price modeling based on product reviews in several ways.",
        "We consider a large set of weakly-related products instead of a homogeneous selection of a few products, and the reviews in our dataset are not product-centered but rather describe the overall experience of visiting a restaurant.",
        "Consequently, menu items are not always mentioned in reviews and rarely appear with their exact names.",
        "This makes it difficult to directly use review features in a pricing model for individual menu items.",
        "Menu planning and pricing has been studied for many years by the culinary and hospitality research community (Kasavana and Smith, 1982; Kelly et al. 1994), often including recommendations for writing menu item descriptions (Miller and Pavesic, 1996; McVety et al. 2008).",
        "Their guidelines frequently include example menus from successful restaurants, but typically do not use large corpora of menus or automated analysis, as we do here.",
        "Other work focused more specifically on particular aspects of the language used on menus, such as the study by Zwicky and Zwicky (1980), who made linguistic observations through manual analysis of a corpus of 200 menus.",
        "Relatedly, Wansink et al(2001; 2005) showed that the way that menu items are described affects customers?",
        "perceptions and purchasing behavior.",
        "When menu items are described evocatively, customers choose them more often and report higher satisfaction with quality and value, as compared to when they are given the same items described with conventional names.",
        "Wansink et aldid not use a corpus, but rather conducted a small-scale experiment in a working cafeteria with customers and collected surveys to analyze consumer reaction.",
        "While our goals are related, our experimental approach is different, as we use automated analysis of thousands of restaurant menus and rely on a set of one million reviews as a surrogate for observing customer behavior.",
        "Finally, the connection between products and prices is also a central issue in economics.",
        "However, the stunning heterogeneity in products makes empirical work challenging.",
        "For example, there are over 50,000 menu items in New York that include",
        "the word chicken.",
        "What is the price of chicken?",
        "This is an important practical and daunting matter when measuring inflation (e.g., Consumer Price Index is measured with a precisely-defined basket of goods).",
        "Price dispersion across goods and the variation of the goods is an important area of industrial organization economic theory.",
        "For example, economists are interested in models of search, add-on pricing, and obfuscation (Baye et al. 2006; Ellison, 2005)."
