        "In practice, we sampled out a subset from training dataset as a development set for the analysis of segmentation results produced by SVM-based segmenter.",

      "heading": "2.1 IV Rules",
      "text": [
        "The following rules are named IV rules, pursuing the consistence between segmentation results and training data.",
        "The intuition underlying the rules is that since training data give somewhat specific descriptions for most of the words in it, a character sequence in testing data should be segmented in accordance with training data as much as possible.",
        "Ahead of post-processing, all words in the training data are grouped into two distinct sets: the uniquity set, which consists of words with unique segmentation in training data and the ambiguity set, which includes words having more than one distinct segmentations in training data.",
        "For example, the character sequence \" ViI f2, \" has two kinds of segmentations, as\"Vi I f2, \" (new century) and \"Vi I f2, \" (as a component of some Named-Entity, such as the name of a restaurant).",
        "• For each segmentation unit in the result produced by SVM-based segmenter, check whether the unit can be segmented into more than one IV words and, meanwhile, the words exist in a successive form for at least once in training data .",
        "If true, replace the segmentation unit with corresponding continuously existing words.",
        "The intuition underlying this rule is that SVM-based segmenter tends to combine a word with some suffix, such as \"�\" �\" A \" , two Chinese characters representing “person”.",
        "For example, \" � ��\" (Person in registration) tends to be grouped as a single unit.",
        "• For any sequence in the ambiguity set, such",
        "as \" Vi I f2, \" , check if the correct segmentation can be determined by the context surrounding the sequence.",
        "Without losing the generality, in the following explanation, we assume each sequence in the ambiguity set has two distinct segmentations.",
        "we collected from training data the word preceding a sequence where each existence of the sequence has one of its segmentations, into a collection, named preceding word set, and, correspondingly, the following word into another set, which is termed following word set.",
        "Analogically, we can produce preceding word • For each word in the uniquity set, check whether it is wrongly segmented into more than one segmentation units by the SVM-based segmenter.",
        "If true, the continuous segmentation units corresponding to the word are grouped into the united one.",
        "The intuition underlying this post-processing rule is that SVM-based segmenter prefers two-character words or single-character words when confronting the case that the segmenter has low self-confidence in some character-sequence segmentation.",
        "For example, \"� �as \" (duplicate) was segmented as \"� �as \" and \" !_�A – \"(unify) was split into \" �_* – \" .",
        "This phenomenon is caused by the imbalanced data distribution.",
        "Specifically, characters belonging to category word-stem are much less than other three categories.",
        "set and following word set for another case of segmentation.",
        "When an ambiguous sequence appears in testing data, the surrounding context (in fact, just one preceding word and a following word) is extracted.",
        "If the context has overlapping with either of the pre-extracted contexts of the same sequence which are from training data, the segmentation corresponding to one of the contexts is retained.",
        "• More over, we took a look into the annotation errors existing in training data.",
        "We assume there unavoidably exist some annotation mistakes.",
        "For example, in UPENN, the sequence \" + � \" (abbreviation for China and America) exists, for eighty-seven times, as a whole word and only one time, exists as \"+ �\" .",
        "We regarded the segmentation \" + � \" as an annotation error.",
        "Generally, when the ratio of two kinds of segmentations is greater than a predetermined threshold (the value is set seven in our system), the sequence is removed from the ambiguity set and added as a word of unique segmentation into the uniquity set."

      "text": [
        "The following rules are termed OOV rules, since they are utilized to recall some of the wrongly segmented OOV words.",
        "A OOV word is frequently segmented into two continuous OOV segmentation units.",
        "For example, the OOV word\" X M \"(Vatican) was frequently segmented as \" X M \" , where both \" X \" and \" M \" are OOV character sequences.",
        "Continuous OOVs present a strong clue of potential segmentation errors.",
        "A rule is designed to merge some of continuous OOVs into a correct segmentation unit.",
        "The designed rule is applicable to all four corpora.",
        "Moreover, since distinction between different segmentation standards frequently leads to very different segmentation of a same OOV words in different corpora, we designed rules particularly for MSRA and UPENN respectively, to recall more OOVs.",
        "• For two continuous OOVs, check whether at least one of them is a single-character word.",
        "If true, group the continuous OOVs into a segmentation unit.",
        "The reason for the constraint of at least one of continuous OOVs being single-character word is that not all continuous OOVs should be combined, for example, \" '(I j 9 4 \" , both \"'( I j \" (Germany merchant) and \"94\" (the company name) are OOVs, but this sequence is a valid segmentation unit.",
        "On the other hand, we assume appropriately that most of the cases for character being single-character word have been covered by training data.",
        "That is, once a single character is a OOV segmentation unit, there exists a segmentation error with high possibility.",
        "• MSRA has very different segmentation standard from other three corpora, mainly because it requires to group several continuous words together into a Name Entity.",
        "For example, the word \" + Q *F Z % \" (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China) appearing in MSRA is generally annotated into two words in other corpora, as \" + Q \" (China) and \"*F Z%\" (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).",
        "In our system, we first gathered all the words from the training data whose length are greater than six Chinese characters, filtering out dates and numbers, which was coveredby Finite State Automation as a preprocessing stage.",
        "For each words collected, regard the first two and three characters as NE prefix, which indicates the beginning of a Name Entity.",
        "The collection of prefixes is termed 5p(�,fz�) .",
        "Analogously, the collection 53(.",
        "f fz�) of suffixes is brought up in the same way.",
        "Obviously not all the prefixes (suffixes) are good indicators for Name Entities.",
        "Partly inheriting from (Brill, 1995), we applied error-driven learning to filter prefixes in 5p and suffixes in 53.",
        "Specifically, if a prefix and a suffix are both matched in a sequence, all the characters between them, together with the prefix and the suffix, are merged into a single segmentation unit.",
        "The resulted unit is compared with corresponding sequence in training data.",
        "If they were not exactly matched, the prefix and suffix were removed from collections respectively.",
        "Finally resulted 5p and 53 are utilized to recognize Name Entities in the initial segmentation results.",
        "• UPENN has different segmentation standard from other three corpora in that, for some",
        "Locations, such as \"�� � \" (Beijing )and Organizations, such as \"*Scf �\" (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), the last Chinese character presents a clue that the character with high possibility is a suffix of some words.",
        "In fact, SVM-based segmenter sometimes mistakenly split an OOV word into a segmentation unit followed by a suffix.",
        "Thus, when some suffixes exist as a single-character segmentation unit, it should be grouped with the preceding segmentation unit.",
        "Undoubtedly not all suffixes are appropriate to this rule.",
        "To gather a clean collection of suffixes, we first clustered together the words with the same suffix, filtering according to the number of instances in each cluster.",
        "Second, the same as above, error-driven method is utilized to retain effective suffixes."
