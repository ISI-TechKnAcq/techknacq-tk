        "Assessment of semantic similarity has proved to be be essential for a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including syntactic disambiguation (either structural or functional), word sense disambiguation, selection of appropriate translation equivalent, assessment of lexical cohesion in texts for automatic summarisation, query expansion and document indexing in Information Retrieval.",
        "Typically, the semantic similarity between words is computed on the basis of taxonomical relationships such as hyperonymy.",
        "Given two word senses W, and W„ their similarity is captured as a function of their belonging to more general semantic classes.",
        "The approach presupposes prior availability of independent hierarchically-structured repositories of lexico-semantic information such as WorciNet.",
        "An interesting issue here is to evaluate how useful this type of resource is in capturing semantic similarity at the desirable level of granularity, given the requirements of the abovelisted applications.",
        "As a general comment, the taxonotnical approach to semantic similarity tends to neglect the role of linguistic context as a perspectivising factor affecting the perception of a semantic similarity between any two words considered.",
        "There is substantial experimental evidence supporting the view that human similarity judgements are affected by the pressure of contextual factors (see, among others, Goldstone et al.",
        "1997): intuitively, while candle and barbecue would score poorly on semantic proximity if considered independently of their use in context, their occurence in expressions such as light a candle, light a barbecue would immediately throw in relief a (possibly weak, but nonetheless contextually relevant) semantic association between the two, established by their connection with the process of burning.",

        "Taxonomies are not in principle incapable of capturing cross-classifications like those based on relational or role properties such as \"being a product\" or \"being a typical object of event/process\".",
        "There are allowances in the latest Wordnet version (1.6) for defining pointers from each concept to - say - nouns representing its parts, or from nouns to verbs to represent functions etc., although the latter are not actually implemented yet.",
        "Nonetheless, it is not obvious how many of these cross-classificatory dimensions should be overlaid on a taxonomy to attain the desirable level of context-sensitivity required by real applications.",
        "From an application-oriented perspective, there is the further problem of how it is possible to regiment their role and relevance as a function of context variation.",
        "As a somewhat radical alternative to taxonomical relationships, other ways of measuring semantic similarity based on distributional evidence have been put forward in the literature (see, among others, Brown et al.",
        "1991, Gale et al.",
        "1992, Pereira and Tishby 1992), which emphasise the role played by context in this game.",

        "Here, the context is generally defined as an n-word window centred on W1/W2.",
        "The method rests on the assumption that words entering into the same syntagmatic relation with other words are perceived as semantically similar.",
        "The method has a potential for capturing word similarities grounded on contextual effects of the sort sketched out above, although it may often happen that, given two instances of the same word W in a text and their corresponding context windows, very few token words are found in both windows.",
        "Strategies to alleviate this sparse data problem have been described for word sense disambiguation (e.g. Schiltze 1992): they define the context no longer in terms of the immediate neighbouring words, but rather as the set of words that neighbouring words normally consort with.",
        "An interesting issue here is whether \"context cascades\" of this sort are still constrained enough to be able to capture effects of context-sensitive similarity.",
        "The amount of data that this method requires is also an issue.",
        "Be that as it may, it is still to be shown conclusively that any of the NLP tasks listed at the outset really requires such a fme grained measure of context-sensitive semantic similarity.",
        "In this paper, we sgritend that an ideal lexical resource aimed at being aged as a yardstick for measuring word sense similarity at the level of granularity required by most NLP applications should strive to complement the lexico-semantic knowledge typically embedded in a WordNet-like resource with distributional evidence of some kind.",
        "This is argued on grounds that: i) contextual factors play an important role in assessing the semantic similarity between words and this is what most applications require.",
        "Both points will be dealt with in some detail in the context of the problem of classifying the typical complements lexically selected by a given verb sense.",
        "We will show that verbs' selectional preferences cannot always be neatly expressed in terms of taxonomy nodes/classes, but rather cut across the taxonomy in a seemingly erratic way, straggling for several relatively unrelated nodes.",
        "Close examination of real data shows that different verb senses select different classes of complements according to different dimensions of semantic similarity, to such an extent that it soon becomes impossible to provide an effective account of these dimensions independently of the verb sense in question."

        "It is important to point out here that this inferential strategy is \"local\" in two senses: i) relative to the example base, and ii) relative to the input pair.",

        "This indicates that distributionally-based and taxonomy-based inferences can nicely be complemented.",
        "In practice, this can be done in more than one way.",
        "In some experiments of syntactic disambiguation (subject/object assignment in Italian, Montemagni 1995, Montemagni et al.",
        "1996), we tried to combine both taxonomical and distributional measures in such a way that the system relied on taxonomical information first, to turn to distributional evidence only when the first step was not conclusive.",
        "This strategy, however, did not seem to be successful, as the system was frequently led astray by irrelevant similarities.",
        "Our experience seems to suggest that a more promising way to integrate distributionally-based and taxonomy-based information is arguably to use distributional evidence rust, so as to exploit the context-sensitivity (or locality) of proportional analogy as a filter of irrelevant similarities.",
        "Taxonomical information is to be relied on only at a second stage, as a fall back solution to outstanding ambiguities."

        "Semantic similarity is not simply a relation between two words in isolation, but rather a relation between two words in their context.",
        "This context-sensitive view of semantic similarity makes its identification more problematic.",
        "In principle, semantic similarity of words",
        "can be captured in a number of different ways, ranging from their taxonornical relationships to their actual distribution in a corpus.",
        "It would be very difficult to argue that one such a way is more plausible than another; nonetheless, it should be observed that their practical utility in well-known interesting NLP applications can vary considerably.",
        "We noted that taxonomy-based measures of semantic similarity are to an extent inadequate, as they capture only some of the classificatory dimensions which play a relevant role in NLP applications.",
        "We showed that relevant similarities need to be grounded on the specific context to be processed (e.g. disambiguated, retrieved or summarised) and that different contexts call for different classificatory dimensions.",
        "Distributional evidence can be used to model this sort of context-sensitive multidimensional classification, so as to induce semantic associations between words that nonetheless belong to different places in a taxonomy.",
        "We also showed that distributionally-based semantic similarity has a considerable impact on crucial NLP tasks such as word sense disambiguation.",
        "All this provides evidence that WordNet-like lexical resources should strive to integrate taxonomical and distributional information, by combining both paradigmatic and syntagmatic dimensions.",
        "As already mentioned, WordNet has a potential for doing that, through extended implementation of so-called pointers from nouns to verbs and from verbs to nouns, to represent functions, typical semantic preferences etc.",
        "Within the EuroWorciNet project (LE24003), some steps in this direction have already been taken in developing multilingual Won'Nets for Dutch, Italian and Spanish.",
        "Among the additions to the original set of relations borrowed from WordNet 1.5, syntagmatic relations feature prominently: e.g., one finds verb-to-noun relations denoting the typical entities involved in a given event, or noun-to-verb relations referring to the typical events in which a given entity play a role (Alonge et al.",
        "forthcoming).",
        "This certainly provides the information needed to capture context-sensitive semantic similarities.",
        "We also showed that local inferential engines such as SENSE can demonstrably tap this type of information with the degree of flexibility, noise-tolerance and input-relevance required, among others, by WSD."
