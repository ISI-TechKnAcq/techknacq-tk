        "The co-occurrence modeling step provides dense, low-dimensional embedding for each fragment which allows us to calculate semantic similarity using various similarity metrics.",

        "Semantic similarity is a measure that specifies the similarity of one text's meaning to another?s.",
        "Semantic similarity plays an important role in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as textual entailment (Berant et al., 2012), summa-rization (Lin and Hovy, 2003), question answering (Surdeanu et al., 2011), text classification (Sebas- tiani, 2002), word sense disambiguation (Sch?utze, 1998) and information retrieval (Park et al., 2005).",
        "There are three main approaches to computing the semantic similarity between two text fragments.",
        "The first approach uses Vector Space Models (see Turney & Pantel (2010) for an overview) where each text is represented as a bag-of-word model.",
        "The similarity between two text fragments can then be computed with various metrics such as cosine similarity.",
        "Sparseness in the input nature is the key problem for these models.",
        "Therefore, later works such as Latent Semantic Indexing (?)",
        "and ",
        "Topic Models (Blei et al., 2003) overcome sparsity problems via reducing the dimensionality of the model by introducing latent variables.",
        "The second approach blends various lexical and syntactic features and attacks the problem through machine learning models.",
        "The third approach is based on word-to-word similarity alignment (Pilehvar et al., 2013; Islam and Inkpen, 2008).",
        "The Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS) task in SemEval 2014 1 (Jurgens et al., 2014) provides an evaluation framework to assess similarity methods for texts in different volumes (i.e., lexical lev-els).",
        "Unlike previous SemEval and *SEM tasks that were interested in comparing texts with similar volume, this task consists of four subtasks (para- graph2sentence, sentence2phrase, phrase2word and word2sense) that investigate the performance of systems based on pairs of texts of different sizes.",
        "A system should report the similarity score of a given pair, ranging from 4 (two items have very similar meanings and the most important ideas, concepts, or actions in the larger text are represented in the smaller text) to 0 (two items do not mean the same thing and are not on the same topic).",
        "In this paper, we describe our two unsupervised systems that are based on co-occurrence statistics of words.",
        "The only difference between the systems is the input they use.",
        "The first system uses the words directly (after lemmatization, stop-word removal and excluding the non-alphanumeric char-acters) in text while the second system utilizes the most likely substitutes consulted by a 4-gram language model for each observed word position (i.e., context).",
        "Note that we participated two subtasks which are paragraph2sentence and sentence2phrase.",
        "The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.",
        "Section 2 explains the preprocessing part, the difference between the systems, co-occurrence mod-eling, and how we calculate the similarity between 1 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/ task3/ 92 Type-ID Lemma Sent-33 choose Sent-33 buy Sent-33 gift Sent-33 card Sent-33 hard Sent-33 decision Table 1: Instance id-word pairs for a given sentence.",
        "two texts after co-occurrence modeling has been done.",
        "Section 3 discusses the results of our systems and compares them to other participants?.",
        "Section 4 discusses the findings and concludes with plans for future work.",
        "2 Algorithm This section explains preprocessing steps of the data and the details of our two systems 2 .",
        "Both systems rely on the co-occurrence statistics.",
        "The slight difference between the two is that the first one uses the words that occur in the given text fragment (e.g., paragraph, sentence), whereas the latter employs co-occurrence statistics on 100 substitute samples for each word within the given text fragment.",
        "2.1 Data Preprocessing Two AI-KU systems can be distinguished by their inputs.",
        "One uses the raw input words, whereas the other uses words?",
        "likely substitutes according to a language model.",
        "AI-KU 1 : This system uses the words that were in the text.",
        "All words are transformed into lower-case equivalents.",
        "Lemmatization 3 and stop-word removal were performed, and non-alphanumeric characters were excluded.",
        "Table 1 displays the pairs for the following sentence which is an instance from paragraph2sentence test set: ?Choosing what to buy with a $35 gift card is a hard decision.?",
        "Note that the input that we used to model co-occurrence statistics consists of all such pairs for each fragment in a given subtask.",
        "2 The code to replicate our work can be found at https://github.com/osmanbaskaya/ semeval14-task3.",
        "3 Lemmatization is carried out with Stanford CoreNLP and transforms a word into its canonical or base form.",
        "AI-KU 2 : Previously, the utilization of high probability substitutes and their co-occurrence statistics achieved notable performance on Word Sense Induction (WSI) (Baskaya et al., 2013) and Part-of-Speech Induction (Yatbaz et al., 2012) problems.",
        "AI-KU 2 represents each context of a word by finding the most likely 100 substitutes suggested by the 4-gram language model we built from ukWaC 4 (Ferraresi et al., 2008), a 2-billion word web-gathered corpus.",
        "Since S-CODE algorithm works with discrete input, for each context we sample 100 substitute words with replacement using their probabilities.",
        "Table 2 illustrates the context and substitutes of each context using a bigram language model.",
        "No lemmatization, stop-word removal and lower-case transformation were performed.",
        "2.2 Co-Occurrence Modeling This subsection will explain the unsupervised method we employed to model co-occurrence statistics: the Co-occurrence data Embedding (CODE) method (Globerson et al., 2007) and its spherical extension (S-CODE) proposed by Maron et al. (2010).",
        "Unlike in our WSI work, where we ended up with an embedding for each word in the co-occurrence modeling step in this task, we model each text unit such as a paragraph, a sentence or a phrase, to obtain embeddings for each instance.",
        "Input data for S-CODE algorithm consist of instance-id and each word in the text unit for the first system (Table 1 illustrates the pairs for only one text fragment) instance-ids and 100 substitute samples of each word in text for the second system.",
        "In the initial step, S-CODE puts all instance-ids and words (or substitutes, depending on the system) randomly on an n-dimensional sphere.",
        "If two different instances have the same word or substitute, then these two instances attract one another ?",
        "otherwise they repel each other.",
        "When S-CODE con-verges, instances that have similar words or substitutes will be closely located or else, they will be distant from each other.",
        "AI-KU 1 : According to the training set performances for various n (i.e., number of dimensions for S-CODE algorithm), we picked 100 for both tasks.",
        "AI-KU 2 : We picked n to be 200 and 100 for paragraph2sentence and sentence2phrase subtasks, respectively.",
