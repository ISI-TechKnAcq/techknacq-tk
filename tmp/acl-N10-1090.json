        "Supertagging is a widely used speed-up technique for lexicalized grammar parsing.",
        "It was first proposed for lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), then extended to combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Clark, 2002) and head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Ninomiya et al., 2006).",
        "For deep parsing, supertagging is an important preprocessor: an accurate supertagger greatly reduces search space of a parser.",
        "Not limited to parsing, supertags can be used for NP chunking (Shen and Joshi, 2003), semantic role labeling (Chen and Rambow, 2003) and machine translation (Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007) to explore rich syntactic information contained in them.",
        "Generally speaking, supertags are lexical templates extracted from a grammar.",
        "These templates encode possible syntactic behavior of a word.",
        "Although the number of supertags is far larger than the 45 POS tags defined in Penn Treebank, sequence labeling techniques are still effective for supertagging.",
        "Previous research (Clark, 2002) showed that a POS sequence is very informative for supertagging, and some extent of local syntactic information can be captured by the context of surrounding words and POS tags.",
        "However, since the context window length is limited for the computational cost reasons, there are still long-range dependencies which are not easily captured in sequential models (Zhang et al., 2009).",
        "In practice, the multi-tagging technique proposed by Clark (2002) assigned more than one supertag to each word and let the ambiguous supertags be selected by the parser.",
        "As for other NLP applications which use supertags, resolving more supertag ambiguities in supertagging stage is preferred.",
        "With this consideration, we focus on supertagging and aim to make it as accurate as possible.",
        "In this paper, we incorporated long-distance information into supertagging.",
        "First, we used dependency parser formalism to model long-distance relationships between the input words, which is hard to model in sequence labeling models.",
        "Then, we combined the dependency information with local context in a simple point-wise model.",
        "The experiments showed that dependency information is very informative for supertagging and we got a competitive 93.70% on supertagging accuracy (fed golden POS).",
        "In addition, we also evaluated the improved supertagger in the HPSG parser."

        "HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) is a lexicalist grammar framework.",
        "In HPSG, a large number of lexical entries is used to describe word-specific syntactic characteristics, while only a small number of schemas is used to explain general construction rules.",
        "These lexical entries are called \"HPSG supertags\".",
        "For example, one possible supertag for the word \"like\" is written like \"[NP.nom<V.bse>NP.acc]_lxm\", which indicates the head syntactic category of \"like\" is verb in base form.",
        "It has a NP subject and a NP complement.",
        "With such fine-grained grammatical type distinctions, the number of supertags is much larger than the number of tags used in other sequence labeling tasks.",
        "The HPSG grammar used in our experiment includes 2,308 supertags.",
        "This increases computational cost of sequence labeling models.",
        "By analyzing the internal structure of the supertags, we found that subject and complements are two important syntactic properties for each supertag.",
        "If we could predict subject and complements of the word well, supertagging would be an easier job to do.",
        "However, current widely used sequence labeling models have the limited ability to catch these longdistance syntactic relations.",
        "In supertagging stage, tree structures are still not constructed.",

        "As shown in Table 2, with such long-distance information supertagging accuracy can reach 97.43%.",
        "Comparing to point-wise model (PW-AP) which only used local context (92.48%), this absolute 4.95% gain indicated that dependency information is really informative for supertagging.",
        "When automatically predicted dependency relations were given, there still were absolute 1.04% (auto POS) and 1.22% (gold POS) improvements from baseline PW-AP model.",
        "We also compared supertagging results with previous works (reported on section 22).",
        "Here we mainly compared the dependency-informed point-wise models with perceptron-based Bayes point machine (BPM) plus CFG-filter (Zhang et al., 2009).",

        "CFG-filtering can be considered as an alternative way of incorporating long-distance constraints on supertagging results.",
        "Although our baseline system was slightly behind (PW-AP: 92.16% vs. BPM:92.53%), the final accuracies of grammatically constrained models were very close (PW-DEP: 93.53% vs. BPM-CFG: 93.60%); They were not statistically significantly different (P-value is 0.26).",
        "As the result of oracle PW-DEP indicated, supertagging accuracy can be further improved with better dependency modeling (e.g., with a semi-supervised dependency parser), which makes it more extensible and attractive than using CFG-filter after the super-tagging process.",
        "We also evaluated the dependency-informed supertagger in a HPSG parser.",

        "As shown in Figure 2, for the case when only one supertag was predicted for each word, F-score of the HPSG parser using dependency-informed supertagger is 5.06% higher than the parser using the baseline supertagger module.",
        "As the candidate number increased, the gap narrowed: when all candidates were given, the gains gradually came down to 0.2%.",
        "This indicated that improved supertagger can optimize the search space of the deep parser, which may contribute to more accurate and fast deep parsing.",
