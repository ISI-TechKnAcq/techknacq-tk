        "Most work in statistical parsing has focused on a single corpus: the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank.",
        "While this has allowed for quantitative comparison of parsing techniques, it has left open the question of how other types of text might affect parser performance, and how portable parsing models are across corpora.",
        "We examine these questions by comparing results for the Brown and WSJ corpora, and also consider which parts of the parser's probability model are particularly tuned to the corpus on which it was trained.",
        "This leads us to a technique for pruning parameters to reduce the size of the parsing model."

        "The past several years have seen great progress in the field of natural language parsing, through the use of statistical methods trained using large corpora of hand-parsed training data.",
        "The techniques of Char-niak (1997), Collins (1997), and Ratnaparkhi (1997) achieved roughly comparable results using the same sets of training and test data.",
        "In each case, the corpus used was the Penn Treebank's hand-annotated parses of Wall Street Journal articles.",
        "Relatively few quantitative parsing results have been reported on other corpora (though see Stolcke et al.",
        "(1996) for results on Switchboard, as well as Collins et al.",
        "(1999) for results on Czech and Hwa (1999) for bootstrapping from WSJ to ATIS).",
        "The inclusion of parses for the Brown corpus in the Penn Treebank allows us to compare parser performance across corpora.",
        "In this paper we examine the following questions:",
        "• To what extent is the performance of statistical parsers on the WSJ task due to its relatively uniform style, and how might such parsers fare on the more varied Brown corpus?",
        "• Can training data from one corpus be applied to parsing another?",
        "• What aspects of the parser's probability model are particularly tuned to one corpus, and which are more general?",
        "Our investigation of these questions leads us to a surprising result about parsing the WSJ corpus: over a third of the model's parameters can be eliminated with little impact on performance.",
        "Aside from cross-corpus considerations, this is an important finding if a lightweight parser is desired or memory usage is a consideration."

        "(2000) find that sub categorization frequencies for certain verbs vary significantly between the Wall Street Journal corpus and the mixed-genre Brown corpus, but that they vary less so between genre-balanced British and American corpora.",
        "Argument structure is essentially the task that automatic parsers attempt to solve, and the frequencies of various structures in training data are reflected in a statistical parser's probability model.",
        "The variation in verb argument structure found by previous research caused us to wonder to what extent a model trained on one corpus would be useful in parsing another.",
        "The probability models of modern parsers include not only the number and syntactic type of a word's arguments, but lexical information about their fillers.",

        "It can be thought of as a variety of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar, with the rule probabilities factored into three distributions.",

        "A special #STOP# symbol is generated to terminate the sequence of children for a given parent.",
        "Each child is generated in two steps: first its syntactic category C and head tag Cht are chosen given the parent's and head child's features and a function A representing the distance from the head child: Pc(C, Chtj P, H, Hht, Hhw, A) Then the new child's head word Chw is chosen: Pcw (Chw jP, H, Hht, Hhw, A, C, Cht) For each of the three distributions, the empirical distribution of the training data is interpolated with less specific backoff distributions, as we will see in Section 5.",
        "Further details of the model, including the distance features used and special handling of punctuation, conjunctions, and base noun phrases, are described in Collins (1999).",
        "The fundamental features of used in the probability distributions are the lexical heads and head tags of each constituent, the co-occurrences of parent nodes and their head children, and the co-occurrences of child nodes with their head siblings and parents.",
        "The probability models of Charniak (1997), Magerman (1995) and Ratnaparkhi (1997) differ in their details but are based on similar features.",
        "Models 2 and 3 of Collins (1997) add some slightly more elaborate features to the probability model, as do the additions of Charniak (2000) to the model of Charniak (1997).",
        "Our implementation of Collins' Model 1 performs at 86% precision and recall of labeled parse constituents on the standard Wall Street Journal training and test sets.",
        "While this does not reflect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000), we regard it as a reasonable baseline for the investigation of corpus effects on statistical parsing."

        "Because this is the only part of the model that involves pairs of words, it is also where the bulk of the parameters are found.",

        "Only the first distribution in this interpolation scheme involves pairs of words, and the third component is simply the probability of a word given its part of speech.",
        "Because the word pair feature is the most specific in the model, it is likely to be the most corpus-specific.",
        "The vocabularies used in corpora vary, as do the word frequencies.",
        "It is reasonable to expect word co-occurrences to vary as well.",
        "In order to test this hypothesis, we removed the distribution �P(Chw lP, H, Hht, Hhw, C, Cht) from the parsing model entirely, relying on the interpolation of the two less specific distributions in the parser:",

        "Results are shown in Table 3.",
        "Perhaps the most striking result is just how little the elimination of lexical bigrams affects the baseline system: performance on the WSJ corpus decreases by less than 0.5% absolute.",
        "Moreover, the performance of a WSJ-trained system without lexical bigrams on Brown test data is identical to the WSJ-trained system with lexical bigrams.",

        "This criterion aims to prune probabilities that are similar to their backoff estimates, and that are not frequently used.",
        "As shown by Stolcke (1998), this criterion is an approximation of the relative entropy between the original and pruned distributions, but does not take into account the effect of changing the backoff weight on other events' probabilities.",
        "Adjusting the threshold 0 below which parameters are pruned allows us to successively remove more and more parameters.",
        "Results for different values of 0 are shown in Table 4.",

        "The Brown bigrams, which have lower correlation values by our metric, include verb/subject and preposition/object relations and seem more broadly applicable as a model of English.",

        "Our results show strong corpus effects for statistical parsing models: a small amount of matched training data appears to be more useful than a large amount of unmatched data.",

        "Adding training data from from an unmatched corpus doesn't hurt, but doesn't help a great deal either.",

        "are of no use when attempting to generalize to new training data.",
        "In fact, they are of surprisingly little benefit even for matched training and test data - removing them from the model entirely reduces performance by less than 0.5% on the standard WSJ parsing task.",
        "Our selective pruning technique allows for a more fine grained tuning of parser model size, and would be particularly applicable to cases where large amounts of training data are available but memory usage is a consideration.",
        "In our implementation, pruning allowed models to run within 256MB that, unpruned, required larger machines.",
        "The parsing models of Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000) add more complex features to the parsing model that we use as our baseline.",
        "An area for future work is investigation of the degree to which such features apply across corpora, or, on the other hand, further tune the parser to the peculiarities of the Wall Street Journal.",
        "Of particular interest are the automatic clusterings of lexical co-occurrences used in Charniak (1997) and Magerman (1995).",
        "Cross-corpus experiments could reveal whether these clusters uncover generally applicable semantic categories for the parser's use.",
