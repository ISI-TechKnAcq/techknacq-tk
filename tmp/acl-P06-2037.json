        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is today a very promising approach.",
        "It allows to build very quickly and fully automatically Machine Translation (MT) systems, exhibiting very competitive results, only from a parallel corpus aligning sentences from the two languages involved.",
        "In this work we approach the task of enriching Spanish WordNet with automatically translated glosses1.",
        "The source glosses for these translations are taken from the English WordNet (Fellbaum,",
        "1998), which is linked, at the synset level, to Spanish WordNet.",
        "This resource is available, among other sources, through the Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) developed by the MEANING project (Atserias et al., 2004).",
        "We start by empirically testing the performance of a previously developed English–Spanish SMT system, built from the large Europarl corpus2 (Koehn, 2003).",
        "The first observation is that this system completely fails to translate the specific WordNet glosses, due to the large language variations in both domains (vocabulary, style, grammar, etc.).",
        "Actually, this is confirming one of the main criticisms against SMT, which is its strong domain dependence.",
        "Since parameters are estimated from a corpus in a concrete domain, the performance of the system on a different domain is often much worse.",
        "This flaw of statistical and machine learning approaches is well known and has been largely described in the NLP literature, for a variety of tasks (e.g., parsing, word sense disambiguation, and semantic role labeling).",
        "Fortunately, we count on a small set of Spanish hand-developed glosses in MCR3.",
        "Thus, we move to a working scenario in which we introduce a small corpus of aligned translations from the concrete domain of WordNet glosses.",
        "This in-domain corpus could be itself used as a source for constructing a specialized SMT system.",
        "Again, experiments show that this small corpus alone does not suffice, since it does not allow to estimate good translation parameters.",
        "However, it is well suited for combination with the Europarl corpus, to generate combined Language and Translation",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Models.",
        "A substantial increase in performance is achieved, according to several standard MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Although moderate, this boost in performance is statistically significant according to the bootstrap resampling test described by Koehn (2004b) and applied to the BLEU metric.",
        "The main reason behind this improvement is that the large out-of-domain corpus contributes mainly with coverage and recall and the in-domain corpus provides more precise translations.",
        "We present a qualitative error analysis to support these claims.",
        "Finally, we also address the important question of how much in-domain data is needed to be able to improve the baseline results.",
        "Apart from the experimental findings, our study has generated a very valuable resource.",
        "Currently, we have the complete Spanish WordNet enriched with one gloss per synset, which, far from being perfect, constitutes an axcellent starting point for a posterior manual revision.",
        "Finally, we note that the construction of a SMT system when few domain-specific data are available has been also investigated by other authors.",
        "For instance, Vogel and Tribble (2002) studied whether an SMT system for speech-to-speech translation built on top of a small parallel corpus can be improved by adding knowledge sources which are not domain specific.",
        "In this work, we look at the same problem the other way around.",
        "We study how to adapt an out-of-domain SMT system using in-domain data.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 the fundamentals of SMT and the components of our MT architecture are described.",
        "The experimental setting is described in Section 3.",
        "Evaluation is carried out in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 contains error analysis and Section 6 concludes and outlines future work."

        "Given a sentence f = f1..fn (distorted signal), it is possible to approximate the sentence e = e1..em (original signal) which produced f .",
        "We need to estimate P(elf), the probability that a translator produces f as a translation of e. By applying Bayes’ rule it is decomposed into: P(el f) = P(f|e)*P(e) To obtain the string e which maximizes the translation probability for f, a search in the probability space must be performed.",
        "Because the denominator is independent of e, we can ignore it for the purpose of the search: e = argmaxeP(f l e) * P(e).",
        "This last equation devises three components in a SMT system.",

        "Language models are typically estimated from large monolingual corpora, translation models are built out from parallel corpora, and decoders usually perform approximate search, e.g., by using dynamic programming and beam search.",
        "However, in word-based models the modeling of the context in which the words occur is very weak.",
