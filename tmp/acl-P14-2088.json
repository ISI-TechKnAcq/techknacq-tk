        "Unsupervised domain adaptation is a fundamental problem for natural language processing, as we hope to apply our systems to datasets unlike those for which we have annotations.",
        "This is particularly relevant as labeled datasets become stale in comparison with rapidly evolving social media writing styles (Eisenstein, 2013), and as there is increasing interest in natural language processing for historical texts (Piotrowski, 2012).",
        "While a number of different approaches for domain adaptation have been proposed (Pan and Yang, 2010; S?gaard, 2013), they tend to emphasize bag-of-words features for classification tasks such as sentiment analysis.",
        "Consequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing (Smith, 2011).",
        "As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces.",
        "We build on work from the deep learning community, in which denoising autoencoders are trained to remove synthetic noise from the observed instances (Glorot et al., 2011a).",
        "By using the autoencoder to transform the original feature space, one may obtain a representation that is less dependent on any individual feature, and therefore more robust across domains.",
        "Chen et al. (2012) showed that such autoencoders can be learned even as the noising process is analytically marginalized; the idea is similar in spirit to feature noising (Wang et al., 2013).",
        "While the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising au-toencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features.",
        "In this paper we investigate noising functions that are explicitly designed for structured feature spaces, which are common in NLP.",
        "For example, in part-of-speech tagging, Toutanova et al. (2003) define several feature ?templates?",
        ": the current word, the previous word, the suffix of the current word, and so on.",
        "For each feature template, there are thousands of binary features.",
        "To exploit this structure, we propose two alternative noising tech-niques: (1) feature scrambling, which randomly chooses a feature template and randomly selects an alternative value within the template, and (2) structured dropout, which randomly eliminates all but a single feature template.",
        "We show how it is possible to marginalize over both types of noise, and find that the solution for structured dropout is substantially simpler and more efficient than the mDA approach of Chen et al. (2012), which does not consider feature structure.",
        "We apply these ideas to fine-grained part-of-speech tagging on a dataset of Portuguese texts from the years 1502 to 1836 (Galves and Faria, 2010), training on recent texts and evaluating 538 on older documents.",
        "Both structure-aware domain adaptation algorithms perform as well as standard dropout ?",
        "and better than the well-known structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm (Blitzer et al., 2007) ?",
        "but structured dropout is more than an order-of-magnitude faster.",
        "As a secondary contribution of this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of unsupervised domain adaptation to the syntactic analysis of historical texts.",
        "2 Model In this section we first briefly describe the denoising autoencoder (Glorot et al., 2011b), its application to domain adaptation, and the analytic marginalization of noise (Chen et al., 2012).",
        "Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features.",

        ",x n ] ?",
        "R d?n , and we write its corrupted version ?",
        "X, then the loss in (1) can be written as L(W) = 1 2n tr [ ( X?W ?",
        "X ) > ( X?W ?",
        "X ) ] .",

        "X ?",
        "X > and P = X ?",
        "X > .",
        "After obtaining the weight matrix W, we can insert non-linearity into the output of the denoiser, such as tanh(WX).",
        "It is also possible to apply stack-ing, by passing this vector through another autoencoder (Chen et al., 2012).",
        "In pilot experiments, this slowed down estimation and had little effect on accuracy, so we did not include it.",
        "High-dimensional setting Structured prediction tasks often have much more features than simple bag-of-words representation, and performance relies on the rare features.",
        "In a naive implementation of the denoising approach, both P and Q will be dense matrices with dimensionality d ?",
        "d, which would be roughly 10 11 elements in our experiments.",
        "To solve this problem, Chen et al. (2012) propose to use a set of pivot features, and train the autoencoder to reconstruct the pivots from the full set of features.",

        "The computation of these expectations depends on the type of noise.",
        "2.2 Noise distributions Chen et al. (2012) used dropout noise for domain adaptation, which we briefly review.",
        "We then describe two novel types of noise that are designed for structured feature spaces, and explain how they can be marginalized to efficiently compute W. Dropout noise In dropout noise, each feature is set to zero with probability p > 0.",

        "Structured dropout noise In many NLP set-tings, we have several feature templates, such as previous-word, middle-word, next-word, etc, with only one feature per template firing on any token.",
        "We can exploit this structure by using an alternative dropout scheme: for each token, choose exactly one feature template to keep, and zero out all other features that consider this token (transition feature templates such as ?y t , y t?1 ?",

        "Unlike standard dropout, there are no free hyper-parameters to tune for structured dropout.",
        "Since E[Q] is a diagonal matrix, we eliminate the cost of matrix inversion (or of solving a system of linear equations).",
        "Moreover, to extend mDA for high dimensional data, we no longer need to divide the corrupted input ?",

        "1 For intuition, consider standard feature dropout with p = K?1 K .",

        "We can use similar reasoning to compute the expectation of P. With probability (1 ?",
        "p), the original features are preserved, and we add the outer-product x i x > i ; with probability p, we add the outer-product x i q > .",
