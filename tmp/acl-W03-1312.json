        "This paper addresses a very specific problem that happens to be common in health science research.",
        "We present a machine learning based method for identifying patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure and other related conditions by automatically classifying clinical notes.",
        "This method relies on a Perceptron neural network classifier trained on comparable amounts of positive and negative samples of clinical notes previously categorized by human experts.",
        "The documents are represented as feature vectors where features are a mix of single words and concept mappings to MeSH and HICDA ontologies.",
        "The method is designed and implemented to support a particular epidemiological study but has broader implications for clinical research.",
        "In this paper, we describe the method and present experimental classification results based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value."

        "Epidemiological research frequently has to deal with collecting a comprehensive set of human subjects that are deemed relevant for a particular study.",
        "For example, the research focused on patients with congestive heart failure needs to identify all possible candidates for the study so that the candidates could be asked to participate.",
        "One of the requirements of a study like that is the completeness of the subject pool.",
        "In many cases, such as disease incidence or prevalence studies, it is not acceptable for the investigator to miss any of the candidates.",
        "The identification of the candidates relies on a large number of sources some of which do not exist in an electronic format, but it may start with the clinical notes dictated by the treating physician.",
        "Another aspect of candidate identification is prospective patient recruitment.",
        "Prospective recruitment is based on inclusion or exclusion criteria and is of great interest to physicians for enabling just-in-time treatment, clinic trial enrollment, or research study options for patients.",
        "At Mayo Clinic most clinical documents are transcribed within 24 hours of patient consultation.",
        "This electronic narration serves as resource for enabling prospective recruitment based on criteria present in clinical document.",
        "Probably the most basic approach to identification of candidates for recruitment is to develop a set of terms whose presence in the note may be indicative of the diagnoses of interest.",
        "This term set can be used as a filtering mechanism by either searching on an indexed collection of clinical notes or simply by doing term spotting if the size of the collection would allow it.",
        "For example, in case of congestive heart failure, one could define the following set of search terms: “CHF”, “heart failure”, “cardiomyopathy”, “volume overload”, “fluid overload”, “pulmonary edema”, etc.",
        "The number of possible variants is virtually unlimited, which is the inherent problem with this approach.",
        "It would be hard to guarantee the completeness of this set to begin with, which is further complicated by morphological and spelling variants.",
        "This problem is serious because it affects the recall, which is especially important in epidemiological studies.",
        "Another problem is that such term spotting or indexing approach would have to be intelligent enough to identify the search terms in negated and other contexts that would render documents containing these terms irrelevant.",
        "A note containing “no evidence of heart failure” should not be retrieved, for example.",
        "Identifying negation reliably and, more importantly, its scope is far from trivial and is in fact a notoriously difficult problem in Linguistics [1].",
        "This problem is slightly less serious than the completeness problem since it only affects precision which is less important in the given context than recall.",
        "In order to be able to correctly identify whether a given patient note contains evidence that the patient is relevant to a congestive heart failure study, one has to “understand” the note.",
        "Currently, there are no systems capable of human-like “understanding” of natural language; however, there are methods that allow at least partial solutions to the language understanding problem once the problem is constrained in very specific ways.",
        "One such constraint is to treat language understanding as a classification problem and to use available machine learning approaches to automatic classification to solve the problem.",
        "Clearly, this is a very limited view of language understanding but we hypothesize that it is sufficient for the purposes referred to in this paper."

        "A detailed description can be found in [13] and [14].",
        "There are several well known limitations of this algorithm.",
        "The most significant is that the simple Perceptron is unable to learn non-linearly separable problems.",
        "In order for this algorithm to work, one should be able to draw a hyperplane in the training data feature space that will linearly separate positive examples from negative.",
        "With large multidimensional feature spaces, it is hard to know a priori whether the space is linearly separable; however, a good indication of that can be gleaned from the classification accuracy testing on several folds of training/testing data.",
        "If the accuracy results show large fluctuations between folds, then that would be a good indication that the space is not linearly separable.",
        "On the other hand if the standard deviation on such a cross-validation task is relatively small, then one could be reasonably certain that Perceptron is a usable technique for the problem.",
        "The other less serious limitation is that there is a chance that the algorithm will falsely conclude convergence in a local minimum on the error function curve without reaching the global minimum, which could also account for low or inconsistent accuracy results.",
        "This limitation is less serious because it can be controlled to some extent with the learning rate parameter, which sets the amount by which the weights are adjusted each time Perceptron makes a classification error during training [14].",
        "Naïve Bayes does not have the limitations of Perceptron, but does have limitations of its own.",
        "The Bayes decision rule chooses the class that maximizes the conditional probability of the class given the context in which it occurs:",
        "Here, C` is the chosen category, C is the set of all categories and Vj is the context.",
        "Naïve Bayes decision algorithm makes a simplifying assumption that the words in Vj are independent of each other.",
        "A particular implementation of the Naïve Bayes decision rule based on the independence assumption to text categorization and word sense disambiguation problems is also known as “bag of words” approach [13].",
        "This approach does not attempt to take into account any sort of possible dependency between the individual words in any given context, in fact it assumes that the word “heart” and the word “failure”, for example, occur completely independently of each other.",
        "Theoretically, such assumption makes Naïve Bayes classifiers very unappealing for text categorization problems, but in practice it has been shown to perform well on a much greater range of domains than the theory would support.",
        "The common feature between the two techniques is that both are linear classifiers and are relatively efficient which makes them attractive for learning from large feature sets with lots of training samples."

        "We have experimented with HICDA codes; however, other coding schemes may be usable or even more usable as well.",
        "We do not claim that either Naïve Bayes or the Perceptron are the best possible classifiers that could be used for the task of identifying patients with certain conditions.",
        "All we show is that either one of these two classifiers is reasonably suitable for the task and has the benefits of computational efficiency and simplicity.",
        "The results of the experiments with the classifiers suggest that although Perceptron has higher accuracy than the Naïve Bayes classifier overall, its positive predictive value is significantly lower.",
        "The latter result makes it less usable for a practical binary classification task focused on identifying patient records that have evidence of congestive heart failure.",
        "It may be worth while pursuing an approach that would use the two classifiers in tandem.",
        "The classifier with the highest PPV would be used to make the first cut to maximize recall and the more accurate classifier would be used to rank the output for subsequent review."
