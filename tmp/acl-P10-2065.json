        "The task of preposition error detection has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years because selecting an appropriate preposition poses a particularly difficult challenge to learners of English as a second language (ESL).",
        "It is not only ESL learners that struggle with English preposition usage – automatically detecting preposition errors made by ESL speakers is a challenging task for NLP systems.",
        "Recent state-of-the-art systems have precision ranging from 50% to 80% and recall as low as 10% to 20%.",
        "To date, the conventional wisdom in the error detection community has been to avoid the use of statistical parsers under the belief that a WSJ-trained parser's performance would degrade too much on noisy learner texts and that the traditionally hard problem of prepositional phrase attachment would be even harder when parsing ESL writing.",
        "However, there has been little substantial research to support or challenge this view.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the following research question: Are parser output features helpful in modeling preposition usage in well-formed text and learner text?",
        "We recreate a state-of-the-art preposition usage system (Tetreault and Chodorow (2008), henceforth T&C08) originally trained with lexical features and augment it with parser output features.",
        "We employ the Stanford parser in our experiments because it consists of a competitive phrase structure parser and a constituent-to-dependency conversion tool (Klein and Manning, 2003a; Klein and Manning, 2003b; de Marneffe et al., 2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "We compare the original model with the parser-augmented model on the tasks of preposition selection in well-formed text (fluent writers) and preposition error detection in learner texts (ESL writers).",
        "This paper makes the following contributions:",
        "• We demonstrate that parse features have a significant impact on preposition selection in well-formed text.",
        "We also show which features have the greatest effect on performance.",
        "• We show that, despite the noisiness of learner text, parse features can actually make small, albeit non-significant, improvements to the performance of a state-of-the-art preposition error detection system.",
        "• We evaluate the accuracy of parsing and especially preposition attachment in learner texts."

        "It is difficult to directly compare these systems since they are trained and tested on different data sets but they achieve accuracy in a similar range.",
        "Of these systems, only the DAPPER system (De Felice and Pulman, 2008; De Felice and Pulman, 2009; De Felice, 2009) uses a parser, the C&C parser (Clark and Curran, 2007)), to determine the head and complement of the preposition.",
        "De Felice and Pulman (2009) remark that the parser tends to be misled more by spelling errors than by grammatical errors.",
        "The parser is fundamental to their system and they do not carry out a comparison of the use of a parser to determine the preposition's attachments versus the use of shallower techniques.",

        "They split the input sentence into the chunks before and after the preposition, and parse both chunks separately.",
        "Only very shallow analyses are extracted from the parser output because they do not trust the full analyses.",
        "Lee and Knutsson (2008) show that knowledge of the PP attachment site helps in the task of preposition selection by comparing a classifier trained on lexical features (the verb before the preposition, the noun between the verb and the preposition, if any, and the noun after the preposition) to a classifier trained on attachment features which explicitly state whether the preposition is attached to the preceding noun or verb.",

        "Note that these are determined not through full syntactic parsing but rather through the use of a heuristic chun-ker.",
        "So, for the phrase many local groups around the country, examples of lexical features for the preposition around include: FN = country, PN = groups, left-2-word-sequence = local-groups, and left-2-POS-sequence = JJ-NNS.",
