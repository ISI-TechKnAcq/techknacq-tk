        "Recent work in political psychology has made it clear that political decision-making is strongly influenced by emotion.",
        "For instance, (Lodge and Taber, 2000) propose a theory of \"motivated reasoning\", in which political information is processed in a way that is determined, in part, by a quickly-computed emotional react to that information.",
        "Strong experimental evidence for motivated reasoning (sometimes called \"hot cognition\") exists (Huang and Price, 2001); (Redlawsk, 2002); (Redlawsk, 2006); (Isbell et al., 2006).",
        "However, despite some recent proposals (Kim et al., 2008) it is unclear how to computationally model a person's emotional reaction to news, and how to collect the data necessary to fit such a model.",
        "One problem is that emotional reactions are different for different people - a fact exploited in the use of political \"code words\" intended to invoke a reaction in only a particular subset of the electorate (a technique sometimes called \"dog whistle politics\").",
        "In this paper, we evaluate the use of machine learning methods to predict how members of a specific political community will emotionally reaction to different types of news.",
        "More specifically, we use a dataset of widely read (\"A-list\") political blogs, and attempt to predict the aggregate sentiment in the comment section of blogs, as a function of the textual content of the blog posting.",
        "In this paper, we consider only predicting polarity (positive and negative feeling).",
        "In contrast to work done traditionally in sentiment analysis which focuses on determining the sentiment expressed in text, in this work, we focus on the task of predicting the sentiment that a block of text will evoke in readers, expressed in the comment section, as a response to the blog post.",
        "This task is related to, but distinct from, several other studies that have been made using comments and discussions in political communities, or analysis of sentiment in comments - (Yano et al., 2009), (O'Connor et al., 2010), (Tumasjan et al., 2010).",
        "Below we discuss the methods used to address the various parts of this task.",
        "First, we evaluate two methods to automatically determine the comment polarity: SentiWordNet (Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010) a general purpose resource that assigns sentiment scores to entries in WordNet, and an automated corpus-specific technique based on pointwise mutual information.",
        "The quality of the polarity assessments by these techniques are made by comparing them to hand annotated assessments on a small number of blog posts.",
        "Second, we consider two methods for predicting comment polarity from post content: support vector machine classification, and sLDA, a topic-modeling-based approach.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that emotional reactions are indeed community-specific, compare the accuracy of this approach to the more traditional approach of predicting sentiment of a text from the text itself, and present our conclusions.",
        "In this study, we use a collection of blog posts from five blogs: Carpetbagger(CB), Daily Kos(DK), Matthew Yglesias(MY), Red State(RS), and Right Wing News(RWN), that focus on American politics made available by (Yano et al., 2009).",
        "The posts were collected during November 2007 to October 2008, which preceded the US presidential elections held in November 2008.",
        "The blogs included in the dataset vary in political idealogy with blogs like Daily Kos that are Democrat-leaning and blogs like Red State tending to be much more conservative.",
        "Since we are interested in studying the responses to blog posts, the corpus only contains posts where there have been at least one comment in the six days after the post was published.",
        "It is important to note that only the text in the blog posts and comments are used in this study.",
        "All non-textual information like pictures, hyperlinks, videos etc.",
        "are discarded.",
        "In terms of text processing, for each blog, a vocabulary is created consisting of all terms that occur at least 5 times in the blog.",
        "Stopwords are eliminated using a standard stopword list.",
        "Each blog post is then represented as a bag of words from the post.",
        "Table 2 shows statistics of the datasets.",
        "Each dataset is studied separately for the most part in the rest of the paper."

      "heading": "3. Labelling comments with sentiment polarity",
      "text": [
        "The first step in understanding the nature of posts that evoke emotional responses is to get a measure of the polarity in the sentiment expressed in the comments section of a blog post.",
        "The measure indicates the ability of the issues in the blog post and its treatment, to evoke strong emotions in readers.",
        "In the first stage of the study, we use SentiWord-Net (Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010) which associates a large number of words in WordNet with a positive, negative and objective score (summing up to 1).",
        "Firstly, all the comments for a blog post in the comment section are aggregated and for the words in the comments that are found in SentiWord-Net, the net positive and negative scores are computed.",
        "Since SentiWordNet entries are associated with word senses and because we don't perform word sense disambiguation, the SentiWordNet polarity of the most dominant word sense is used for words in the comment section.",
        "The sentiment in the comment section is deemed to be positive if the net positive score exceeds the negative score and negative otherwise.",
        "Therefore, each blog post is now associated with a binary response variable indicating the polarity of the sentiment expressed in the comments.",
        "A second technique to determine the sentiment polarity of comments uses the principle of pointwise mutual information (PMI)(Turney, 2002).",
        "We first construct a seed list of positive and negative words by choosing the 100 topmost positive and negative words from SentiWordNet and manually eliminating words from this list that don't pertain to sentiment in our context.",
        "(Appendix A has the list of seed words used.)",
        "This seed list is used to construct a larger set of positive and negative words by computing the PMI of the words in the seed lists with every other word in the vocabulary.",
        "It's important to note that this list is constructed for the specific corpus that we work with.",
        "Because every blog is processed separately, we construct a different sentiment word list for each blog based on the statistics of word occurences.",
        "Words in the vocabulary are ranked by the difference in the average of the PMI with positive and negative seed words.",
        "The top 1000 words in the resultant sorted list are treated as positive words and the bottom 1000 words as negative words.",
        "The comment section of every post is tagged with a positive or negative polarity as in the previous section by computing the total positive and negative word counts.",
        "Using the same seed word list, the procedure is performed separately for each blog resulting in sentiment polarity lists that are particular to the community and idealogy associated with each blog.",
        "It should be noted that while this method provides better estimates of comment sentiment polarity (as seen in Section 4), it involves more manual work in constructing a seed set than the SentiWordNet method which does not require any manual effort.",
        "As a third method that is accurate but expensive, we manually labeled comments from approximately 30 blog posts from each blog, with a positive or negative label.",
        "The guideline in labeling was to determine if the sentiment in the comment section was positive or negative to the subject of the post.",
        "The chief intention of this exercise is to determine the quality of the polarity assessments of the SentiWord-Net and PMI methods.",
        "While it is possible to directly use the assessments and train a classifier, the performance of the classifier will be limited by the very small number of training examples (30 instead of thousands of examples).",
        "The accuracy of the two automatic methods to determine comment polarity is shown in Table 2",
        "The better accuracy of the PMI method can be explained by the fact that SentiWordNet is a general purpose list that is not customized for the domain which tends to make it noisy for text in the political domain.",
        "The PMI technique corresponds more closely with the human labels but it requires a little human effort in building the initial seed list of positive and negative words."

        "Next, we use Supervised LDA (sLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2008) to do the classification.",

        "In this task, the output variable is +1 or 1 depending on the polarity of the comment section.",
        "In the experiments with sLDA, we set the number of topics as 15 after experimenting with a range of topics and use 10-fold cross validation.",
        "The number of topics is set lower than it usually is with topic modeling, due to the relatively short length and small number of documents.",

        "The other negative topic concerns the war in Iraq which was also very unpopular within people whose beliefs are liberal-leaning.",

        "The most negative topic deals with Islam and Muslim people which are issues that have tended to evoke negative reactions from certain sections of people with conservative political beliefs.",
