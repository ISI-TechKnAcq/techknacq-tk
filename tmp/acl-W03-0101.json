        "An evaluation and comparison to high performance IE system using very small location gazetteers is given.",
        "One important aspect of our work is that we choose to create a knowledge base of locations, structured according to an ontology and having relations between them, instead of having somewhat flat structures of gazetteer lists found in other IE systems.",
        "While a knowledge base can be plugged into an IE system instead of a flat gazetteer, it also has several unique advantages:",
        "• the extra information, especially the transitive sub-RegionOf relation can be used for disambiguation and reasoning • the location entities in the text can be recognised at the right level of granularity for the target application (i.e., as Location or as Country, City, etc).",
        "• the ontology and knowledge base can be modified by the user and any changes are reflected immediately in the output of the IE system.",

        "Section 2 puts our work in the context of previous research.",
        "Section 3 presents briefly the KIM platform, which contains the IE system and the location knowledge base.",
