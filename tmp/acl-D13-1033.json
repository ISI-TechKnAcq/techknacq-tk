        "The morphological tagger is then trained on the full training set and applied to development and test set.",
        "Figure 2 shows the dependency between the amount of training data given to the parser and the quality of the morphological tagger using syntactic features provided by this parser.",
        "The leftmost point corresponds to a model that does not use syntactic information.",
        "For both languages, German and Czech, we find that already 1,000 sentences are enough training data for the parser to provide useful syntactic information to the morphological tagger.",
        "After 5,000 sentences, both curves flatten out and stay on the same level.",
        "We conclude that using syntactic features for morphological prediction is viable even if there is only small amounts of syntactic data available to train the parser.",
        "As a related experiment, we also test if we can get the same effect with a very simple and thus much faster parser.",
        "We use the brute-force algorithm described in Covington (2001), which selects for each token in the sentence another token as the head.",
        "It does not have any tree requirements, so it is not even guaranteed to yield a cycle-free tree structure.",

        "Evaluation is done in terms of labeled (LAS) and unlabeled attachment score (UAS).10",
        "Trained on first 5,000 sentences of the training set.",
        "As expected, the simple parser performs much worse in terms of syntactic quality.",
        "Table 8 shows the performance of the morphological tagger when using the output of both parsers as syntactic features.",
        "For Czech, both parsers seem to supply similar information to the morphological tagger, while for German, using the full parser is clearly better.",
        "In both cases, the morphological tagger outperforms the models that do not use syntactic information (cf. Table 3).",
        "The performance on unknown words is however much worse for both languages.",
        "We conclude that even with a simple parser and little training data, the morphology can make use of syntactic information to some extent.",

        "4 Does Better Morphology lead to Better Parses?",
        "In the previous sections, we show that syntactic information improves a model for predicting morphology for Czech and German, where syntax and morphology interact considerably.",
        "A natural question then is whether the improvement also occurs in the other direction, namely whether the improved morphology also leads to better parsing models.",
        "In the previous experiments, we run a 10-fold jackknifing process to annotate the training data with morphological information using no syntactic features and afterwards use jackknifing with the parser to annotate syntax.",
        "The syntax is subsequently used as features for our predicted-syntax experiments.",
        "We can apply the same process once more with the morphology prediction in order to annotate the training data with morphological information that is predicted using the syntactic features.",
        "A parser trained on this data will then use the improved morphology as features.",
        "If the improved morphology has an impact on the parser, the quality of the second parsing model should then be superior to the first parsing model, which uses the morphology predicted without syntactic information.",
        "Note that for the following experiments, neither morphology model uses the morphological lexicon.",
        "Table 9 presents the evaluation of the two parsing models (one using morphology without syntactic features, the other one using the improved morphology).",
        "The results show no improvement in parsing performance when using the improved morphology.",
        "Looking closer at the output, we find differences be",
        "ity of the dependency parser for Czech and German.",
        "tween the two parsing models with respect to grammatical functions that are morphologically marked.",
        "For example, in German, performance on subjects and accusative objects improves while performance for dative objects and genitives decreases.",
        "This suggests different strengths in the two parsing models.",
        "However, the question how to make use of the improved morphology in parsing clearly needs more research in the future.",
        "A promising avenue may be the approach by Hohensee and Bender (2012)."

        "The system used a finite-state morphology to propose a set of candidate tags for each word, which is then further restricted using hand-crafted rules over the already available syntax tree.",
        "Lee et al. (2011) pursue the idea of jointly predicting syntax and morphology, out of the motivation that joint models should model the problem more faithfully.",
        "They demonstrate that both sides can use information from each other.",
        "However, their model is computationally quite demanding and its overall performance falls far behind the standard pipeline approach where both tasks are done in sequence.",

        "Modeling morphosyntactic relations explicitly has been shown to improve statistical parsing models (Tsarfaty and Sima?an, 2010; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010; Seeker and Kuhn, 2013), but the codependency between morphology and syntax makes it a difficult problem, and linguistic intuition is often contradicted by the empirical findings.",
        "For example, Marton et al. (2013) show that case information is the most helpful morphological feature for parsing Arabic, but only if it is given as gold information, whereas using case information from an automatic system may even harm the performance.",
        "Morphologically rich languages pose different challenges for automatic systems.",
        "In this paper, we work with European languages, where the problem of predicting morphology can be reduced to a tagging problem.",
        "In languages like Arabic, Hebrew, or Turkish, widespread ambiguity in segmentation of single words into meaningful morphemes adds an additional complexity.",
        "Given a good segmentation tool that takes care of this, our approach is applicable to these languages as well.",
        "For Hebrew, this problem has also been addressed by jointly modeling segmentation, morphological prediction, and syntax (Cohen and Smith, 2007; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2013)."

        "In this paper, we have demonstrated that using syntactic information for predicting morphological information is helpful if the language shows form syncretism in combination with morphosyntactic phenomena like agreement.",
        "A model that uses syntactic information is superior to a sequence model because it leverages the syntactic dependencies that may hold between morphologically dependent words as suggested by linguistic theory.",
        "We also showed that only small amounts of training data for a statistical parser would be needed to improve the morphological tagger.",
        "Making use of the improved morphology in the dependency parser is not straightforward and requires more investigation in the future.",
        "Modeling the interaction between morphology and syntax is important for building successful parsing pipelines for languages with free word order and rich morphology.",
        "Moreover, our experiments show that paying attention to the individual properties of a language can help us explain and predict the behav-ior of automatic tools.",
        "Thus, the term ?morphologically rich language?",
        "should be viewed as a broad term that covers many different languages, whose differences among each other may be as important as the difference with languages with a less rich morphology."
