        "In a formative user study, we compare this approach to gold-standard human abstracts and extracts to gauge the usefulness of the different summary types for browsing meeting conversations.",
        "We find that our automatically generated summaries are ranked significantly higher than human-selected extracts on coherence and usability criteria.",

        "The most common solution to the task of summarizing spoken and written data is sentence (or utterance) extraction, where binary sentence classification yields a cut-and-paste summary comprising informative sentences from the document concatenated in a new, condensed document.",
        "Such extractive approaches have dominated the field of automatic summarization for decades, in large part because extractive systems do not require a natural language generation (NLG) component since the summary sentences are simply lifted from the source document.",
        "Extrinsic evaluations have shown that, while extractive summaries may be less coherent than human abstracts, users still find them to be valuable tools for browsing documents (He et al., 1999; McKeown et al., 2005; Murray et al., 2009).",
        "However, these previous evaluations also illustrate that concise abstracts are generally preferred by users and lead to higher objective task scores.",
        "A weakness of typical extractive summaries is that the end user does not know why the extracted sentences are important; exploring the original sentence context may be the only way to resolve this uncertainty.",
        "And if the input source document consists of noisy, unstructured text such as ungrammatical, disfluent multi-party speech, then the resultant extract is likely to be noisy and unstructured as well.",
        "Herein we describe a complete and fully automatic system for generating abstract summaries of meeting conversations.",
        "Our abstractor maps input sentences to a meeting ontology, generates messages that abstract over multiple sentences, selects the most informative messages, and ultimately generates new text to describe these relevant messages at a high level.",
        "We conduct a user study where participants must browse a meeting conversation within a very constrained timeframe, having a summary at their disposal.",
        "We compare our automatic abstracts with human abstracts and extracts and find that our abstract summaries significantly outperform extracts in terms of coherence and usability according to human ratings.",
        "In general, users rate abstract-style summaries much more highly than extracts for these conversations."

        "Automatic summarizaton has been described as consisting of interpretation, transformation and generation (Jones, 1999).",
        "Popular approaches to text extraction essentially collapse interpretation and transformation into one step, with generation either being ignored or consisting of postprocessing techniques such as sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Clarke and Lapata, 2006) or sentence merging (Barzilay and McKe-own, 2005).",
        "In contrast, in this work we clearly separate interpretation from transformation and incorporate an NLG component to generate new text to describe meeting conversations.",
        "While extraction remains the most common approach to text summarization, one application in which abstractive summarization is widely used is data-to-text generation.",
        "Summarization is critical for data-to-text generation because the amount of collected data may be massive.",
        "Examples of such applications include the summarization of intensive care unit data in the medical domain (Portet et al., 2009) and data from gas turbine sensors (Yu et al., 2007).",
        "Our approach is similar except that our input is text data in the form of conversations.",
        "We otherwise utilize a very similar architecture of pattern recognition, pattern abstraction, pattern selection and summary generation.",
        "Kleinbauer et al.",
        "(2007) carry out topic-based meeting abstraction.",
        "Our systems differ in two major respects: their summarization process uses human gold-standard annotations of topic segments, topic labels and content items from the ontology, while our summarizer is fully automatic; secondly, the ontology they used is specific not just to meetings but to the AMI scenario meetings (Carletta et al., 2005), while our ontology applies to conversations in general, allowing our approach to be extended to emails, blogs, etc.",
        "In this work we conduct a user study where participants use summaries to browse meeting transcripts.",
        "Some previous work has compared extracts and abstracts for the task of a decision audit (Murray et al., 2009) , finding that human abstracts are a challenging gold-standard in terms of enabling participants to work quickly and correctly identify the relevant information.",
        "For that task, automatic extracts and the semi-automatic abstracts of Kleinbauer et al.",
        "(2007) were found to be competitive with one another in terms of user satisfaction and resultant task scores.",
        "Other research on comparing extracts and abstracts has found that an automatic abstractor outperforms a generic extractor in the domains of technical articles (Saggion and Lapalme, 2002) and evaluative reviews (Carenini and Cheung, 2008), and that human-written abstracts were rated best overall."

        "Source document interpretation in our system relies on a general conversation ontology.",
        "The ontology is written in OWL/RDF and contains upper-level classes such as Participant, Entity, Utterance, and DialogueAct.",
        "When additional information is available about participant roles in a given domain, Participant subclasses such as ProjectManager can be utilized.",
        "Object properties connect instances of ontology classes; for example, the following entry in the ontology states that the object property hasSpeaker has an instance of Utterance as its domain and an instance of Participant as its range.",
        "<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about=\"#hasSpeaker\"> <rdfs:range rdf:resource=\"#Participant\"/> <rdfs:domain rdf:resource=\"#Utterance\"/> </owl:ObjectProperty>",
        "The DialogueAct class has subclasses corresponding to a variety of sentence-level phenomena: decisions, actions, problems, positive-subjective sentences, negative-subjective sentences and general extractive sentences (important sentences that may not match the other categories).",
        "Utterance instances are connected to DialogueAct subclasses through an object property hasDAType.",
        "A single utterance may correspond to more than one DialogueAct; for example, it may represent both a positive-subjective sentence and a decision.",
        "Our current definition of Entity instances is simple.",
        "The entities in a conversation are noun phrases with midrange document frequency.",
        "This is similar to the definition of concept proposed by Xie et al.",
        "(2009), where n-grams are weighted by tf.idf scores, except that we use noun phrases rather than any n-grams because we want to refer to the entities in the generated text.",
        "We use midrange document frequency instead of idf (Church and Gale, 1995), where the entities occur in between 10% and 90% of the documents in the collection.",
        "We do not currently attempt coreference resolution for entities; recent work has investigated coreference resolution for multi-party dialogues (Muller, 2007; Gupta et al., 2007), but the challenge of resolution on such noisy data is highlighted by low accuracy (e.g. F-measure of 21.21) compared with using well-formed text.",
        "We map sentences to our ontology classes by building numerous supervised classifiers trained on labeled decision sentences, action sentences, etc.",
        "A general extractive classifier is also trained on sentences simply labeled as important.",
        "We give a specific example of the ontology mapping using the following excerpt from the AMI corpus, with entities italicized and resulting sentence classifications shown in bold:",

        "The interpretation component as just described relies on supervised classifiers for the detection of items such as decisions, actions, and problems.",
        "This component uses general features that are applicable to any conversation domain.",
        "The first set of features we use for this ontology mapping are features relating to conversational structure.",
        "They include sentence length, sentence position in the conversation and in the current turn, pause-style features, lexical cohesion, centroid scores, and features that measure how terms cluster between conversation participants and conversation turns.",
        "While these features have been found to work well for generic extractive summarization (Murray and Carenini, 2008), we use additional features for capturing the more specific sentence-level phenomena of this research.",
        "These include character trigrams, word bigrams, part-of-speech bigrams, word pairs, part-of-speech pairs, and varying instantiation n-grams, described in more detail in (Murray et al., 2010).",
        "After removing features that occur fewer than five times, we end up with 218,957 total features.",
        "Rather than merely classifying individual sentences as decisions, action items, and so on, we also aim to detect larger patterns - or messages - within the meeting.",
        "For example, a given participant may repeatedly make positive comments about an entity throughout the meeting, or may give contrasting opinions of an entity.",
        "In order to determine which messages are essential for summarizing meetings, three human judges conducted a detailed analysis of four development set meetings.",
        "They first independently examined previously-written human abstracts for the meetings to identify which messages were present in the summaries.",
        "In the second step, the judges met together to decide on a final message set.",
        "This resulted in a set of messages common to all the meetings and agreed upon by all the judges.",
        "The messages that our summarizer will automatically generate are defined as follows:",
        "â€¢ OpeningMessage and ClosingMessage: Briefly describes opening/closing of the meeting",
        "â€¢ RepeatedPositiveMessage and RepeatedNegativeMes-sage: Describes a participant making positive/negative statements about a given entity",

        "â€¢ ProblemMessage: Indicates that a participant repeatedly discussed problems or issues about some entity",
        "â€¢ GeneralDiscussionMessage: Indicates that a participant repeatedly discussed a given entity",
        "Message generation takes as input the ontology mapping described in the previous section, and outputs a set of messages for a particular meeting.",
        "This is done by identifying pairs of Participants and Entities that repeatedly co-occur with the various sentence-level predictions.",
        "For example, if the project manager repeatedly discusses the interface using utterances that are classified as positive-subjective, a RepeatedPositiveMessage is generated for that Participant-Entity pair.",
        "Messages are generated in a similar fashion for all other message types except for the opening and closing messages.",
        "These latter two messages are created simply by identifying which participants were most active in the introductory and concluding portions of the meeting and generating messages that describe that participant opening or closing the meeting.",

        "The A term is used to balance sentence and message weights.",
        "Our sentence weight wi is the sum of all the posterior probabilities for sentence i derived from the various sentence-level classifiers.",
        "In other words, sentences are weighted highly if they correspond to multiple object properties in the ontology.",
        "To continue the example from Section 3, the sentence Let's go with the simple chip will be highly weighted because it represents both a decision and a positive-subjective opinion.",
        "The message score Uj is the number of sentences contained by the message j.",
        "For instance, the DecisionMessage at the end of Section 3.2 contains two sentences.",

        "Similar to how sentences and concepts are combined in the previous ILP extraction approach (Xie et al., 2009; Gillick et al., 2009), messages and sentences are tied together by two additional constraints:",
        "where oij is the occurence of sentence i in message j.",
        "These constraints state that a sentence can only be selected if it occurs in a message that is selected, and that a message can only be selected if all of its sentences have also been selected.",

        "The summary length L is set to 15% of the conversation word count.",
        "Note that this is a constraint on the length of the selected utterances; we additionally place a length constraint on the generated summary described in the following section.",

        "We take a top-down, schema-based approach to document planning (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "This method is effective for summaries with a canonical structure, as is the case with meetings.",
        "There are three highlevel schemas invoked in order: opening messages, body messages, and closing messages.",
        "For the body of the summary, messages are retrieved from the ontology using SPARQL, an SQL-style query language for ontologies, and are clustered according to entities.",
        "Entities are temporally ordered according to their average timestamp in the meeting.",
        "In the overall document plan tree structure, the body plan is comprised of document subplans for each entity, and the document sub-plan for each entity is comprised of document subplans for each message type.",
        "The output of the document planner is a tree structure with messages as its leaves and document plans for its internal nodes.",
        "Our text planner is implemented within the Jena semantic web programming framework.",
        "The microplanner takes the document plan as input and performs two operations: aggregation and generation of referring expressions.",
        "There are several possibilities for aggregation in this domain, such as aggregating over participants, entities and message types.",
        "The analysis of our four development set meetings revealed that aggregation over meeting participants is quite common in human abstracts, so our system supports such aggregation.",
        "This involves combining messages that differ in participants but share a common entity and message type; for example, if there are two RepeatedPositiveMessage instances about the user interface, one with the project manager as the source and one with the industrial designer as the source, a single RepeatedPositiveMessage instance is created that contains two sources.",
        "We do not aggregate over entities for the sole reason that the text planner already clustered messages according to entity.",
        "The entity clustering is intended to give the summary a more coherent structure but has the effect of prohibiting aggregation over entities.",
        "To reduce redundancy in our generated abstracts, we generate alternative referring expressions when a participant or an entity is mentioned multiple times in sequence.",
        "For participants, this means the generation of a personal pronoun.",
        "For entities, rather than referring repeatedly to, e.g., the remote control, we generate expressions such as that issue or this matter.",
        "The text realizer takes the output of the microplan-ner and generates a textual summary of a meeting.",
        "This is accomplished by first associating elements of the ontology with linguistic annotations.",
        "For example, participants are associated with a noun phrase denoting their role, such as the project manager.",
        "Since entities were defined simply as noun phrases with mid-frequency IDF scores, an entity instance is associated with that noun phrase.",
        "Messages themselves are associated with verbs, subject templates and object templates.",
        "For example, instances of DecisionMessage are associated with the verb make, have a subject template set to the noun phrase of the message source, and have an object template [NP a decision PP [concerning _]] where the object of the prepositional phrase is the noun phrase associated with the message target.",

        "Condition AH is again significantly better than EH and AH (both p<0.0001).",
        "AA is rated substantially higher than EH on summary relevance, but not at a significant level.",
        "Q5 is a key question because it directly addresses the issue of summary usability for such a task.",
        "Condition AH is significantly better than EH and AA (both p<0.0001), but we also find that AA is significantly better than EH (p=0.0476).",
        "Extracts have an average score of only 2.37 out of 5, compared with 3.21 and 4.63 for automatic and human abstracts, respectively.",
        "For quickly reviewing a meeting conversation, abstracts are much more useful than extracts.",
        "Q6 indicates whether the summaries were missing any relevant information.",
        "As with Q2, a lower score is better.",
        "Condition AH is significantly better than EH and AA (p<0.0001 and p=0.0179), while AA is better than EH with marginal significance (p=0.0778).",
        "This indicates that our automatic abstracts were better at containing all the relevant information than were human-selected extracts.",
        "All participants gave written answers to the open-ended questions, yielding insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the different summary types.",
        "Regarding the automatic abstracts (AA), the most common criticisms were that the summaries are too vague (e.g. \"more concrete would help\") and that the phrasing can be repetitive.",
        "There is a potential many-to-many mapping between abstract sentences and transcript sentences, and some participants felt that it was unnecessarily redundant to be linked to the same transcript sentence more than once (e.g. \"quite a few repetitive citations\").",
        "Several participants felt that the sentences regarding positive-subjective and negative-subjective opinions were overstated and that the actual opinions were either more subtle or neutral.",
        "One participant wrote that these sentences constituted \"a lot of bias in the summary.\"",
        "On the positive side, several participants considered the links between abstract sentences and transcript sentences to be very helpful, e.g. \"it really linked to the transcript well\" and \"I like how the summary has links connected to the transcript.",
        "Easier to follow-up on the meeting w/ the aid of the summary.\"",
        "One participant particularly liked the subjectivity-oriented sentences: \"Lifting some of the positive/negative from the discussion into the summary can mean the discussion does not even need to be included to get understanding.\"",
        "The written comments on the extractive condition (EH) were almost wholly negative.",
        "Many participants felt that the extracts did not even constitute a summary or that a cut-and-paste from the transcript does not make a sufficient summary (e.g. \"The summary was not helpful @ all because it's just cut from the transcript\", \"All copy and paste not a summary\", \"Not very clear summary - looked like the transcript\", and \"No effort was made in the summary to put things into context\").",
        "Interestingly, several participants criticized the extracts for not containing the most important sentences from the transcript despite these being human-selected extracts, demonstrating that a good summary is a subjective matter.",
        "The comments on human abstracts (AH) were generally very positive, e.g. \"easy to follow\", \"it was good, clear\", and \"I could've just read the summary and still understood the bulk of the meeting's content.\"",
        "The most frequent negative criticisms were that the abstract sentences sometimes contained too many links to the transcript (\"massive amount of links look daunting\"), and that the summaries were sometimes too vague (\"perhaps some points from the discussion can be included, instead of just having topic outlines\", \"[want] specific details\").",
        "It is interesting to observe that this latter criticism is shared between human abstracts and our automatic abstracts.",
        "When generalizing over the source document, details are sometimes sacrificed."

        "The automatic abstracts are also significantly better in terms of containing all of the relevant information (Q6), and it is impressive that an automatic abstractor substantially outperforms human-selected content on such a metric.",
        "In future work we aim to bridge the performance gap between automatic and human abstracts by identifying more specific messages and reducing redundancy in the sentence mapping.",
        "We plan to improve the NLG output by introducing more linguistic variety and better text structuring.",
