        "For example, the Chinese Part-Of-Speech annotation corpus used to train program for Chinese word segmentation and POS tag, the Chinese tree bank used to Chinese syntax study, and so on.",
        "In this paper the constructing of a large-scale Chinese-English parallel corpus, which is totally above 500,000 pair sentences and the first year task is 100,000 pair sentences, is described.",
        "The applications of the large-scale Chinese-English parallel corpus put emphasis on the sentence template extracting for EBMT (Example-Based Machine Translation) and translation model training for SBMT (Statistical-Based Machine Translation).",
        "The latent applications may include the bilingual lexicon extraction, special term or phase extraction, bilingual teaching, Chinese-English contrastive study, etc.",
        "Numerous corpus data gathering efforts exit all of the world.",
        "The rapid multiplication of such efforts has made it critical to create a set of standards for encoding corpora.",
        "CES (Corpus Encoding Standard), which is conformant to the TEI Guideline for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI 2002), has been adopted by many corpus-based work.",

        "The coding of our Chinese-English Parallel Corpus is in broad agreement with the TEI Guideline for electronic texts.",
        "In the following section, we first present a brief review of the current status of Chinese corpora with the emphasis on parallel corpus.",
