        "A cursory glance at any one of them at two different points in time can reveal widely varying content.",
        "For a concrete example, we can ask, “What is Computational Linguistics about?” Some topics, such as machine translation, lie at the heart of the discipline and will always be of interest.",
        "Others are ephemeral or have reached theoretical upper bounds on performance.",
        "It is thus more appropriate to ask what CL is about at some point in time.",

        "Text Categorization (TC) systems are typically used to classify a stream of documents soon after they are produced, based upon a set of historical training data.",
        "It is common for some TC applications, such as topic tracking (see Section 5.2), to downweight older features, or the feature vectors of entire documents, while placing more emphasis on features that have recently shown increased importance through changes in frequency and discriminative ability.",
        "Our task, which we call retrospective categorization, uses historical data in both the training and test sets.",
        "It is retrospective from the viewpoint of a current user browsing through previous writings that are categorized with respect to a “modern” interpretation.",
        "Our approach is motivated by three observations concerning lexical change over time, and our task is to modify features so that a text classifier can account for all three.",
        "First, lexical changes can take place within a category.",
        "The text collections used in our experiments are from various conference proceedings of the Association of Computing Machinery, which uses a hierarchical classification system consisting of over 500 labels (see Section 2).",
        "As was suggested by the example of Table 1, even if classification labels remain constant over time, the terms that best characterize them can change to reflect evolving “meanings”.",
        "We can expect that many of the terms most closely associated with a category like Computational Linguistics cannot be captured properly without explicitly addressing their temporal context.",
        "Second, lexical changes can occur between categories.",
        "A term that is significant to one category can suddenly or gradually become of interest to another category.",
        "This is especially applicable in news corpora (see examples in Section 3), but also applies to academic research documents.",
        "Terminological “migrations” between topics in computer science, and across all of science, are common.",
        "Third, any coherent document collection on a particular topic is sufficiently dynamic that, over time, its categorization system must be updated to reflect the changes in the world on which its texts are based.",
        "Although Computational Linguistics predates Artificial Intelligence (Kay, 2003), many now consider the former a subset of the latter.",
        "Within CL, technological and theoretical developments have continually altered the labels ascribed to particular works.",
        "In the ACM’s hierarchical Computing Classification System (see Section 2.1), several types of transformations are seen in the updates it received in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998.1 In bifurcations, categories can be split apart.",
        "With collapses, categories that were formerly more fine-grained, but now do not receive much attention, can",

        "With this construction, the most refined categories will have fewer example documents, while broader categories will have more.",
