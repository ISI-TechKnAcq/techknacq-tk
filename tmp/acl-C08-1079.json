        "Pronoun resolution is the task of determining the antecedent of an anaphoric pronoun, or a pronoun pointing back to some previously mentioned item in a text.",
        "For example, in the sentence, \"The IL-2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression: it is only expressed in CD4+ T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation,\" the pronoun \"it\" should be resolved to refer to \"the IL-2 gene,\" and thus, we have an anaphora link.",
        "Pronoun resolution is an important task in the family of reference resolution tasks, including anaphora resolution and co-reference resolution, which are known as significant parts of text understanding systems.",
        "Recently the need to have more powerful information extraction systems for biomedical technical papers has motivated researchers to solve the same task for the biomedical domain.",
        "Castano (Castano et al., 2002) resolved the sortal and pronominal anaphora, by using a salience measure, which is the sum of all feature scores.",
        "Kim and Park (Kim and C.Park, 2004) introduced BioAR, a biomedical anaphora resolution system that relates entity mentions in text with their corresponding Swiss-Prot entries.",
        "This system resolves anaphoric pronouns by using heuristic rules and seven patterns for parallelism.",
        "However, the sizes of the data sets used in their experiments were small.",
        "In the former system, 46 and 54 MEDLINE abstracts were used for the development set, and the test set respectively, and the test set in the latter work contained only sixteen anaphoric pronouns.",
        "Contrary to their work, in this work we made use of GENIA, a large co-reference annotated corpus for the bio domain, containing 1999 MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "While there are quite a few works on this task for the biomedical domain, for other domains, and especially for the news domain, a myriad of works on pronoun resolution has been carried out by the NLP researchers (Mitkov, 2002).",
        "Since Soon (Soon et al., 2001) started the trend of using the machine learning approach by using a binary classifier in a pairwise manner for solving co-reference resolution problem, many machine learning-based systems have been built, using both supervised and, unsupervised learning methods (Haghighi and Klein, 2007).",
        "Such methods were claimed to be comparable with traditional methods.",
        "However, the problems caused by domain differences, which strongly affect a deep-semantics related task like pronoun resolution, have not yet been studied well enough.",
        "In order to recognize the important factors in building an effective machine learning-based pronoun resolution system, and in particular for the bio-domain, we have built a machine learning-based pronoun resolver and observed the contributions of different features in the pronoun resolution process.",

        "In this section, we briefly introduce three corpora used in our experiments: MUC-7, ACE, and GE-NIA, and discuss the differences in their annotation schemes.",
        "Afterwards, we analyzed the major differences in the distributions of anaphoric pronouns in these data sets, which provide important information for the design of features used in the pronoun resolution process.",
        "The MUC-7 co-reference corpus is a collection of news wire articles from the source for North American News Text Corpora.",
        "It contains the training, dry run test, and formal run test sets.",
        "The dry run and formal run have different domains; the dry run (and training) consists of aircrash scenarios, while the formal run consists of missile launch scenarios.",
        "The ACE (phase 2) corpus for named entity detection contains three data sets: news wire (NWIRE), broadcast news (BNEWS), and newspaper (NPAPER).",
        "Each data set is divided into 2 parts for training (train), and for development testing (devtest).",
        "For the bio-domain, we use the GENIA co-reference corpus, containing 1999 abstracts selected from MEDLINE: a huge source of bio-domain scientific papers.",
        "These three corpora are all manually annotated with co-reference information; i.e., the information where mentions refer to the same entities.",
        "However, since the annotation schemes used are not the same, these corpora contain some significant differences, which may affect our reference resolution systems.",
        "Figure 1: The symmetric and asymmetric annotation schemes.",
        "The dotted lines represent implicit links between the elements.",
        "We started by introducing some important terminologies together with some noticeable issues related to the common co-reference annotation scheme.",
        "Later, we mention the differences among the annotation schemes of the three corpora used in our experiments.",
        "There are three main elements in the co-reference corpus annotation: the anaphoric expressions, which are anaphoric pronouns in the case of the pronominal anaphora, their antecedents, and the referred concepts.",
        "Depending on either the asymmetric scheme employed in MUC (Lynette, 1997) and GENIA (Hong, 2004) or the symmetric scheme in ACE (NIST, 2003), the annotation task is defined as either an anaphor-antecedent linking, or mention-concept linking task, correspondingly (See Figure 1).",
        "Moreover, each annotation scheme provides its own guidelines for recognizing and annotating these three elements, causing the variations across different co-reference annotated corpora.",
        "In the annotation schemes, mentions which may join in the co-reference relationship are called markable.",
        "All of the three annotation schemes record both a maximal and a minimal boundary of markables, in concerning the evaluation schemes.",
        "However, the types of markables to be annotated, and the ways to decide their maximal boundary, are not the same in every annotation scheme.",
        "Table 1 shows the concepts annotated for each corpora according to the annotation schemes.",
        "While the number of concepts in the ACE corpus is limited to only 5 entity types, the GENIA and MUC annotation schemes do not clearly specify the concept types.",
        "This means that every possible concept in the text domains can join the anaphora relations; i.e., can be annotated as markables.",
        "This in turn makes the resolution task become more difficult.",
        "Table 3: Possible types of antecedent according to the annotation schemes (O: allowed, X: not allowed, U: unspecified)",
        "Table 2: Possible types of anaphor according to the annotation schemes (O: allowed, X: not allowed, U: unspecified)",
        "The possible types of annotated anaphoric pronouns are given in Table 2.",
        "O denotes the type of pronoun, which may be annotated as markable, in contrast to X, which denotes the type of pronoun, which is not allowed to be annotated as markable.",
        "The notation U represents the annotation scheme that does not state how a type should be treated because that type is not popular in the domain, or the scheme does not allow the annotation of such a type implicitly.",
        "Using the similar notations as in Table 2, Table 3 shows the possible syntactic structures of antecedents according to the annotation schemes, which are also the structures of markables in real annotations.",
        "In practice, such structural variations may cause troubles for automatically markable recognition, so in the experiments with pronoun resolution, gold markables are often used to eliminate error-prone problems.",
        "Our objective anaphoric pronouns are limited to the following types: personal pronouns (all cases), possessive pronouns, and demonstrative pronouns, which have a nominal antecedent.",
        "In addition to these types of pronouns, the annotated corpora contain other types of pronominal anaphora, including \"both,\" \"one,\" numeric mentions (GE-NIA), and bound anaphora (ACE) However, analysis statistics show that such pronouns occupy less than 5% of the total pronouns in the GENIA corpus, thus we have ignored them",
        "In the preprocessing step, for each corpus, we extract the gold pronominal anaphora links, which link the anaphoric pronouns with their antecedents Although MUC and GENIA used the same asymmetric annotation schemes, picking one gold antecedent in a set of co-referenced mentions is not straightforward, since pronouns in GENIA are not allowed to be linked with a pronomial antecedent, while in the MUC corpus, this kind of link is allowed In order to achieve the fairest comparative experimental results, we uniformly choose the nearest item in the co-reference chain of a pronoun, and make a gold anaphora link This policy is best suited for ACE, thanks to the symmetric scheme used",

        "In addition to the baseline feature set, we enhanced our resolver with more features.",
        "Among them, there are two noticeable features: the grammatical role of pronouns or antecedent candidates, and the named entity type of the candidates.",
        "The other feature groups are used in Denis and Baldridge's system, which we also want to test in our system.",
        "Table 8 shows the resolution results and the increase when adding the corresponding feature group.",
        "With the exception of the last3c features, the others significantly improved the resolution success rate on bio-texts, although they did not have clear contributions to the news domain data sets.",
        "The following is our further analysis to see the way that these features can contribute to the pronoun resolution process.",
        "Semantic features (netype)",
        "The first feature we would like to observe is the combination oiCjietype andPsemw features, which contributed to the increase by 3.64 points.",
        "We further conducted a small test by excluding this combination from the netype feature group, but the success rate remained unchanged from the baseline result.",
        "This signifies that this combination contributed the most to the above increase.",
        "The combination of Cjietype and P^semw features exploits the co-ocurrence of the semantic type of the candidate antecedent and the context word, which appears in some relationship with the pronoun.",
        "This combination feature uses the information similar to the semantic compatibility features proposed by Yang (Yang et al., 2005) and Bergsma (Bergsma and Lin, 2006).",
        "Depending on the pronoun type, the feature extractor decides which relationship is used.",
        "For example, the resolver successfully recognizes the antecedent of the pronoun its in this discourse: \"HSF3 is con stitutively expressed in the erythroblast cell line HD6 , the lymphoblast cell line MSB , and embryo fibroblasts , and yet its DNA-binding activity is induced only upon exposure of HD6 cells to heat shock,\" because HSF3 was detected as a Protein entity, which has a strong association with the governing head noun activity of the pronoun.",
        "Another example is the correct anaphora link between \"it\" and \"the viral protein\" in the following sentence, which the other features failed to detect.",
        "\"Tax , the viral protein , is thought to be crucial in the development of the disease , since it transforms healthy T cells in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals.\"",
        "The correct antecedent was recognized due to the bias given to the association of the Protein entity type, and the governing verb, \"transform \" of the pronoun.",
        "The experimental results show the contribution of the domain knowledge to the pronoun resolution, and the potential combination use of such knowledge with the syntactic features.",
        "Parse features (parg)",
        "The combinations of the primitive features of grammatical roles significantly improved the performance of our resolver.",
        "The following examples show the correct anaphora links resulting from using the parse features:",
        "• \"By comparison, PMA is a very inefficient inducer of the jun gene family in Jurkat cells.",
        "Similar to its effect on the induction of API by okadaic acid, PMA inhibits the induction of c-jun mRNA by okadaic acid.\"",
        "In this example, the possessive pronoun \"its \" in the second sentence corefers to \"PMA\", the subject of the preceding sentence.",
        "Among the combination features in this group, one noticeable feature is the combination of Cjparg, Sdist, and PJype which contains the association of the grammatical role of the candidate, the sentence-based distance, and the pronoun type.",
        "The idea of adding this combination is based on the Centering theory (Walker et al., 1998), a theory of discourse successfully used in pronoun resolution.",
        "This simple feature shows the potential of encoding centering theory in the machine learning features, based on the parse information.",
        "Feature integration",
        "Finally, we integrated all of the positive feature groups for each data set in the above experiments, and tested this combining feature set.",

        "Through the differences in the corpus annotation schemes, in the corpora themselves, and in contributions of resolution factors to the pronoun resolution process, we can see that adapting pronoun resolution for a different domain is not an easy task.",
        "A good study on the types of anaphoric pronouns and entity mention structures beforehand can help design a better feature set for our machine learning-based pronoun resolution system and thus, can save much time and labor.",
        "As shown in this paper, for the news domain, the properties of anaphoric pronouns contain rich information about their antecedents, which is very useful in the resolution process.",
        "While in biomedical text, it is more important to capture the information to connect a pronoun and its antecedent from their surrounding context, because the anaphoric pronouns themselves contain almost no information of their antecedents with the exception of the numbers.",
        "As a future work, it would be interesting to see how the system performs in other domains.",
