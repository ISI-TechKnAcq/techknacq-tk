        "The term biometrics, in Information Technology, refers to an array of techniques to identify people based on one or more unique behavioural or physiological characteristics.",
        "The techniques themselves have improved considerably over the past few decades, in terms of performance and reliability, with reported error rates at levels that indicate a reasonable level of technological maturity (Wayman et al., 2005).",
        "But in order to be truly useful the technology has to be acceptable to people in each of its areas of application.",
        "It is widely recognised (BioSec, 2004) that to achieve this goal a user-centred understanding much deeper than that which we have today is needed, and one which encompasses the important problem of interaction with the interface.",
        "These, of course, are basic goals of the more general field of Human-Computer Interaction, added to which are more specific issues regarding security (Sasse, 2004).",
        "As regards application interface technology, ever more realistic animated characters or embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are being gradually introduced in the hope that they will enhance the users' experience and enrich the interaction.",
        "Some applications of ECAs promise to bring us closer to achieving universal usability.",
        "For instance, they can be used to communicate with hearing impaired people through sign language (Huenerfauth, 2005) or lip-reading (Beskow et al., 2004).",
        "Furthermore, language and the appearance, style, gesture repertoire and attitude of the character can be tuned to each application's context, to user preferences, and more importantly to take into account cultural particularities.",
        "The effects of animated characters on users and on the dynamics of user-system interaction are still unclear, as is the question of how to use them in order to maximize the benefits desired.",
        "However, the literature does report significant improvements in users' perception of the system and their interaction with it when the interface includes an animated character (Moundridou and Virvou, 2001; Mori et al., 2003; Van Mulken et al., 1998).",
        "In what way and to what extent are the perceptions of users affected by the presence of an animated character in the system interface?",
        "And how does this affect users' opinion and acceptance of a biometric authentication system?",
        "We designed an experiment to learn a bit more about these important usability questions.",
        "Expanding on previous studies of factors that impact on the usability of a biometric authentication system, the present paper reports the differences we have found in the subjective perceptions of users interacting with our biometric authentication system through interfaces offering two different forms of assistance: information and assistance in the form of text shown onscreen, and given by a talking animated character.",
        "In the following section we review a variety of social and user perception parameters identified in the literature as being potentially affected by an ECA.",
        "In section 3 we describe our user test framework and we show our results in section 4."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "According to Nass et al.",
        "(1994) human-machine interaction is fundamentally social.",
        "This has clear implications for user interface design.",
        "The user's view of how the system works doesn't always correspond to the actual way the technology works, but, rather, it depends on the user's preconceptions, on the interaction process itself and on mental models that are influenced by the system interface.",
        "Introducing an ECA in the interface can have a visual impact on the user that can affect her perception of the system as a whole.",
        "Ruttkay et al.",
        "(2002) compile a number of user parameters (such as trust, ease of use, effectiveness, and personal taste) that have been shown in the literature to be affected by the presence of an ECA.",
        "Basically, there are two lines of work related to the effects of ECAs on the users' perception of a system.",
        "On one hand, the so called \"persona effect,\" associated with the presence of the ECA, and on the other, effects connected with the characteristics or qualities a specific ECA might have.",
        "People seem to like and enjoy using systems with ECAs more than without them, they tend to find systems easier to use and tasks easier to accomplish, and they also feel more motivated and find learning easier (both learning to use the system and learning about a particular subject in the case of teaching applications), even though their performance is in fact roughly the same as that of users interacting without the ECA: Some authors speculate that objective performance improvements beyond user perceptions will be achieved in the longrun.",
        "For instance, Moundridou and Virvou (2001) believe that the increased motivation of students using a tutor application with an animated character may enhance their learning capacity in the long-term.",
        "Animated characters can even help contain user stress and frustration caused by difficulties during interaction with the system (Mori et al., 2003), and as a result they may improve the efficiency of the interaction over that of a text-only system (Hone et al., 2003).",
        "An interesting point is that many of these psychological effects are observed as a response to the mere presence of the animated character, without it providing any obvious cues or expression to help the user: people's perceptions have also been found to be affected by an ECA's behaviour.",
        "The phenomenon has been called 'Persona Effect' (Lester et al., 1997).",
        "Later research (Van Mulken et al., 1998) has shown that the mere presence of an ECA can make tasks seem easier and more enjoyable to the user.",
        "Furthermore, an ECA showing greater empathic emotion towards the user improves the latter's overall impression of the system and perception of ease of use (Brave et al., 2005; Mori et al., 2003).",
        "The presence of a human-like character can also have potential dangers such as the system anthro-pomorphisation effect that may lead to users having unrealistic expectations that are frustrated by actual interaction, as Walker et al.",
        "(1994) points out, concluding that a human face in an interface can help attract the user's attention and increase her level of motivation.",
        "At the same time, however, it can create high expectations about the intelligence of the system, which can lead to frustration if they are then not met.",
        "Some authors have studied how the attitude displayed by the ECA, for instance regarding its pro-activity and reactivity (Xiao et.",
        "al, 2004), may induce in the user certain responses such as a sense of ease of use, system usefulness, frustration or sluggishness in task execution.",
        "Indeed, it has been shown that an affective and empathic attitude on the part of the ECA can have a very positive effect on the user's perception of the interaction, lowering the level of frustration (Hone et al., 2003; Mori et al., 2003) and improving the user's opinion of the system (Brave et.",
        "al 2005).",
        "Another line of research deals with the gestures and nonverbal behaviour of the ECA.",
        "A good gestural repertoire may promote in the user a perception of naturalness of interaction with the system and system socialness (see, e.g., Cassell and Bickmore, 2000).",
        "The physical appearance of the ECA has also been seen to have an influence on the user.",
        "For instance, Leenheer (2006) has studied the effect of the colour of the clothing on the ECA, and Hone (2006) shows that a female character reduces user frustration levels better than a male one.",
        "Hone also points out that the actual efficiency of the interaction may depend on the ECAs characteristics.",
        "Dehn and Van Mulken (2000) suggest that the great variability of results in the literature may be due not only to the different features of the ECAs across the studies, but also to the different areas of application in which the ECAs were used.",
        "In this paper we present a study of the influence of an ECA in a specific application domain: biometric authentication.",
        "First we identify the user perception parameters that we have considered may be affected by the ECA.",
        "Then we describe our exploratory test to examine the persona effect.",
        "We have left the observation of the effects of the physical, attitudinal and gestural features of the ECA for future experiments."

        "We created a multibiometric authentication test platform with two user interfaces, one with an ECA guiding the user through the steps of the required tasks, the other with the same information provided only through text displayed on the screen.",
        "We asked the users to carry out two general tasks: a) to try to access the system acting as impostors, and b) to enrol using their own biometric traits and then authenticate their real identity.",
        "The test platform architecture simulates a scenario in which a user has to securely access restricted information stored on a remote server across an IP network (Internet or Intranet).",
        "In order to access such information the user's identity must be authenticated on the basis of two biometric traits (hence our characterisation of the system as multi-biometric).",
        "The user may choose the two modes she wishes to authenticate her identity with from among the following four: fingerprint, signature, voice and iris pattern.",

        "Below is a biometric trait visualisation area and a text message bar through which (in addition to the ECA) the system guides the user throughout the interaction.",
        "In addition, we divided the test users into two groups to which we presented two different interaction \"metaphors\":",
        "• ECA Metaphor: An ECA is permanently present on the right side of the screen to assist the user by giving her general instructions and guiding her through the steps of the interaction.",
        "The ECA gives no information regarding the details of each particular biometric mode.",
        "The ECA has been created and integrated into our application using the technology provided by Haptek (Haptek, 2007).",

        "pie, 2007) to speak to the user.",
        "Figure 1 shows the interface with the ECA.",
        "• TEXT Metaphor: The user is only guided through text messages.",
        "Note: In the ECA metaphor the text message bar remains active, serving as subtitles to what the ECA says.",
        "The messages read by the ECA are exactly the same as those given in text form in both metaphores.",
        "Figure 1 : User interface for the multibiometric authentication system.",
        "We designed the tests following the recommendations issued by the International Biometric Group (IBG, 2006).",
        "We worked with a sample of 20 users, half of which interacted with the ECA metaphor and the other half with the TEXT metaphor.",
        "The users carried out the following tasks distributed in two separate sessions (on different days):",
        "• On the first day an experimenter trained each participant in the use of each biometric mode.",
        "The training is specific for each mode and results in the creation of a biometric trait pattern for each user.",
        "After creating the user models the impostor tests were carried out.",
        "We allowed the users to consult the biometric traits (i.e., fingerprint, signature, voice sample and picture of the iris) of four people (2 females and 2 males), and we asked them to choose one of them in each of five impersonation attempts.",
        "In order to access the system (in this case as impostors) users had to successfully mimic any two biometric traits of the same person.",
        "The system returned the result of the attempt (success or failure) at the end of the verification",
        "process.",
        "After taking all of the 5 attempts the users were directed to a web questionnaire to rate the ease of use, sense of security and preference of each of the biometric modes, and to give an overall score for the system.",
        "• The second day the users were asked to authenticate their own identity.",
        "The task was to successfully access the system three times in a maximum of 6 attempts.",
        "Just as in the impostor attempts, users had to enter two of their biometric traits in succession, after which they were informed of the system's decision to accept or reject them.",
        "In case of failure in either of the two chosen modes, the system didn't inform the users of which mode failed.",
        "At the end of this second session the users completed another web questionnaire to give us their evaluation of system privacy and an overall score of merit for the system, and for each biometric mode they rated pleasantness, ease of use and preference.",
