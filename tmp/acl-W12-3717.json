        "Even though the pedophilia has been studied from different research points, it remains to be a very important problem which requires further research, especially from the automatic detection point of view.",
        "Previous studies report that in the majority of cases of sexual assaults the victims are under-aged (Snyder, 2000).",
        "On the Internet, attempts to solicit children have become common as well.",
        "Mitchell (2001) found out that 19% of children have been sexually approached online.",
        "However, manual monitoring of each conversation is impossible, due to the massive amount of data and privacy issues.",

        "In this paper, we address the problem of detecting pedophiles with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "This problem becomes even more challenging because of the chat data specificity.",
        "Chat conversations are very different not only from the written text but also from other types of social media interactions, such as blogs and forums, since chatting in the Internet usually involves very fast typing.",
        "The data usually contains a large amount of mistakes, misspellings, specific slang, character flooding etc.",
        "Therefore, accurate processing of this data with automated syntactic analyzers is rather challenging.",
        "Previous research on pedophilia reports that the expression of certain emotions in text could be helpful to detect pedophiles in social media (Egan et al., 2011).",
        "Following these insights we suggest a list of features, including sentiments as well as other content-based features.",
        "We investigate the impact of these features on the problem of automatic detection of online sexual predation.",
        "Our experimental results show that classification based on such features discriminates pedophiles from non-pedophiles with high accuracy.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 overviews related work on the topic,",

        "They have also investigated the issues of the minimum amount of training data needed.",
        "Their experiments have shown that with 50% of the original dataset the accuracy remains almost the same, and with only 10% it is still much better than the random baseline performance.",
        "NLP techniques were as well applied to capture child sexual abuse data in P2P networks (Panchenko et al., 2012).",
        "The proposed text classification system is able to predict with high accuracy if a file contains child pornography by analyzing its name and textual description.",
