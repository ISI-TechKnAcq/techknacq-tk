        "A common set of participants serves as the event arguments; e.g., the agent (or subject) of DETONATION is often the same as the theme (or object) of INVESTIGATION and corresponds to a PERPETRATOR.",
        "Such structures can be formally captured by the notion of a frame (a.k.a.",
        "template, scenario), which consists of a set of events with prototypical transitions, as well as a set of slots representing the common participants.",

        "In information extraction and other semantic processing tasks, the dominant paradigm requires two stages of manual effort.",
        "First, the target representation is defined manually by domain experts.",
        "Then, manual effort is required to construct an extractor or to annotate examples to train a machine-learning system.",
        "Recently, there has been a burgeoning body of work in reducing such manual effort.",
        "For example, a popular approach to reduce annotation effort is bootstrapping from seed examples (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007; Huang and Riloff, 2012).",
        "However, this still requires prespecified frames or templates, and selecting seed words is often a challenging task (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Filatova et al. (2006) construct simple domain templates by mining verbs and the named entity type of verbal arguments that are topical, whereas Shinyama and Sekine (2006) identify query-focused slots by clustering common named entities and their syntactic contexts.",
        "Open IE (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) limits the manual effort to designing a few domain-independent relation patterns, which can then be applied to extract relational triples from text.",
        "While extremely scalable, this approach can only extract atomic factoids within a sentence, and the resulting triples are noisy, non-canonicalized text fragments.",
        "More relevant to our approach is the recent work in unsupervised semantic induction, such as unsupervised semantic parsing (Poon and Domingos, 2009), unsupervised semantical role labeling (Swier and Stevenson, 2004) and induction (Lang and Lapata, 2011, e.g.), and slot induction from web search logs (Cheung and Li, 2012).",
        "As in PROFINDER, they model distributional contexts for slots and roles.",
        "However, these approaches focus on the semantics of independent sentences or queries, and do not capture discourse-level dependencies.",
        "The modeling of frame and event transitions in PROFINDER is similar to a sequential topic model (Gruber et al., 2007), and is inspired by the successful applications of such topic models in sum-marization (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Daume?",
        "III and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009, inter alia).",
        "There are, however, two main differences.",
        "First, PROFINDER contains not a single sequential topic model, but two (for frames and events, respectively).",
        "In addition, it also models the interdependencies among events, slots, and surface text, which is analogous to the USP model (Poon and Domin-gos, 2009).",
        "PROFINDER can thus be viewed as a novel combination of state-of-the-art models in unsupervised semantics and discourse modeling.",
        "In terms of aim and capability, PROFINDER is most similar to Chambers and Jurafsky (2011), which culminated from a series of work for identifying correlated events and arguments in narratives (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009).",
        "By adopting a probabilistic approach, PROFINDER has a sound theoretical underpinning, and is easy to modify or extend.",
        "For example, in Section 3, we show how PROFINDER can easily be",
        "augmented with additional linguistically-motivated features.",
        "Likewise, PROFINDER can easily be used as a semi-supervised system if some slot designations and labeled examples are available.",
        "The idea of representing and capturing stereotypical knowledge has a long history in artificial intelligence and psychology, and has assumed various names such as frames (Minsky, 1974), schemata (Rumelhart, 1975), and scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977).",
        "In the linguistics and computational linguistics communities, frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982) uses frames as the central representation of word meaning, culminating in the development of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), which contains over 1000 manually annotated frames.",
        "A similarly rich lexical resource is the MindNet project (Richardson et al., 1998).",
        "Our notion of frame is related to these representations, but there are also subtle differences.",
        "For example, Minsky's frame emphasizes inheritance, which we do not model in this paper1.",
        "As in semantic role labeling, FrameNet focuses on semantic roles and does not model event or frame transitions, so the scope of its frames is often no more than an event in our model.",
        "Perhaps the most similar to our frame is Roger Schank's scripts, which capture prototypical events and participants in a scenario such as restaurant dining.",
        "In their approach, however, scripts are manually defined, making it hard to generalize.",
        "In this regard, our work may be viewed as an attempt to revive a long tradition in AI and linguistics, by leveraging the recent advances in computational power, NLP, and machine learning."

        "This evaluation was inspired by the connection between summarization and information extraction (White et al., 2001), and reflects a conceptualization of summarization as inducing and extracting structured information from source text.",
        "Essentially, we adapted the TAC summarization annotation to create gold-standard slots, and used them to evaluate entity extraction as in MUC-4.",
        "Dataset We used the TAC 2010 guided-summarization dataset in our experiments (Owczarzak and Dang, 2010).",
        "This data set consists of text from five domains (termed categories in TAC), each with a template defined by TAC organizers.",
        "In total, there are 46 document clusters (termed topics in TAC), each of which contains 20 documents and has eight human-written summaries.",
        "Each summary was manually segmented using the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) and each segment was annotated with a slot (termed aspect in TAC) from the corresponding template.",

        "Specifically, we extracted the head lemma from all the maximal noun phrases found in the contributor (Figure 3c) and treated them as gold-standard entity slots to extract.",
        "While this conversion may not be ideal in some cases, it simplifies the TAC slots and enables automatic evaluation.",
        "We leave the refinement of this conversion to future work, and believe it could be done by crowdsourcing.",
        "For each TAC slot in a TAC category, we extract entities from the summaries that belong to the given TAC category.",
        "A system-induced entity is considered a match to a TAC-derived entity from the same document if the head lemma in the former matches one in the latter.",
        "Based on this matching criterion, the system-induced slots are mapped to the TAC slots in a way that achieves the best F1 for each TAC slot.",

        "For example, in a document about a tsunami, earthquake may appear both in the WHAT slot as a disaster itself, and in the CAUSE slot as a cause for the tsunami.",
        "One salient difference between TAC and MUC slots is that TAC slots are often more general than MUC slots.",
        "For example, TAC slots such as WHY and COUNTERMEASURES likely correspond to multiple slots at the granularity of MUC.",
        "As a result, we also consider mapping the N best system-induced slots to each TAC slot, for N up to 5.",

        "We did not provide C&J's model with access to external data, in order to enable fair comparison with our model.",
        "Since all of the summary sentences are expected to be relevant, we did not conduct document or sentence relevance classification in C&J or PROFINDER.",
        "We tuned all parameters by twofold cross validation on the summaries.",
        "We computed the overall precision, recall, and F1 by taking a micro-average over the results for each TAC slot.",
        "Results The results are shown in Table 2.",
        "PROFINDER substantially outperformed C&J in F1, in both 1-best and N best cases.",
        "As in MUC-4, the precision of C&J is higher, partly because C&J often did not do much in clustering and produced many small clusters.",
        "For example, in the 1-best setting, the average number of entities mapped to each TAC slot by C&J is 21, whereas it is 208 for PROFINDER.",
        "For both systems, the results are generally lower compared to that in MUC-4, which is expected since this task is harder given the greater diversity in frames and slots to be induced."

        "We have presented PROFINDER, the first probabilistic approach to frame induction and shown that it achieves state-of-the-art results on end-to-end entity extraction in standard MUC and TAC data sets.",

        "Our probabilistic approach makes it easy to extend the model with additional linguistic insights and prior knowledge.",
        "While we have made a case for unsupervised methods and the importance of robustness across domains, our method is also amenable to semi-supervised or supervised learning if annotated data is available.",
