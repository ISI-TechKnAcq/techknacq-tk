        "Turkish is an interesting language that deserves being examined semantically.",
        "Turkish is based upon suffixation, which differentiates it sharply from the majority of European languages, and many others.",
        "Like all Turkic languages, Turkish is agglutinative, that is, grammatical functions are indicated by adding various suffixes to stems.",
        "Turkish has a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) sentence structure but other orders are possible under certain discourse situations.",
        "As a SOV language where objects precede the verb, Turkish has postpositions rather than prepositions, and relative clauses that precede the verb.",
        "Turkish, as a widely-spoken language, is appropriate for semantic researches.",
        "TLST utilizes some resources that are explained in Section 2-5.",
        "In Section 6 evaluation of the system is provided.",
        "In section 7 some concluding remarks and future work are discussed."
