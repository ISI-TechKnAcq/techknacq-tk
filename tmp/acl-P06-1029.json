        "2004; Roark et al.",
        "2004; Gao et al.",
        "2005; Suzuki and Gao 2005).",
        "The success of discriminative training methods is largely due to fact that unlike the traditional approach (e.g., MLE) that maximizes the function (e.g., likelihood of training data) that is loosely associated with error rate, discriminative training methods aim to directly minimize the error rate on training data even if they reduce the likelihood.",
        "However, given a finite set of training samples, discriminative training methods could lead to an arbitrary complex model for the purpose of achieving zero training error.",
        "It is well-known that complex models exhibit high variance and perform poorly on unseen data.",
        "Therefore some regularization methods have to be used to control the complexity of the model.",
        "Lasso is a regularization method for parameter estimation in linear models.",
        "It optimizes the model parameters with respect to a loss function subject to model complexities.",
        "The basic idea of lasso is originally proposed by Tibshirani (1996).",
        "Recently, there have been several implementations and experiments of lasso on multi-class classification tasks where only a small number of features need to be handled and the lasso solution can be directly computed via numerical methods.",
        "To our knowledge, this paper presents the first empirical study of lasso for a realistic, large scale task: LM for Asian language text input.",
        "Because the task utilizes millions of features and training samples, directly optimizing the penalized lasso loss function is impossible.",
        "Therefore, two approximation methods, the boosted lasso (BLasso, Zhao and Yu 2004) and the forward stagewise linear regression (FSLR, Hastie et al.",
        "2001), are investigated.",
        "Both methods, when used with the exponential loss function, bear strong resemblance to the boosting algorithm which has been used as a discriminative training method for LM.",

Other features (fd(W), for d = 1...D) are defined as the counts of word n-grams (n = 1 and 2 in our experiments) in W. • Finally, the parameters of the model form a vector of D+1 dimensions, each for one feature function, λ = [λ0, λ1, ..., λD].",

        "The classical Ridge Regression setting uses an L2 penalty in Equation (10) i.e., T(λ) = ∑d = 0...D(λd)2, which is much easier to minimize (for least square loss but not for ExpLoss).",
        "However, recent research (Donoho et al.",
        "1995) shows that the L1 penalty is better suited for sparse situations, where there are only a small number of features with nonzero weights among all candidate features.",

        "As suggested by Collins and Koo (2005), this ensures that the contribution of the log-likelihood feature f0 is well-calibrated with respect to ExpLoss.",

        "Therefore, we speculate that a better approximation to lasso, as BLasso with backward steps, would be superior in eliminating the negative effect of strongly correlated features in model estimation.",
        "To verify our speculation, we performed the following experiments.",
        "For each training set, in addition to word unigram and bigram features, we introduced a new type of features called headword bigram.",
        "As described in Gao et al.",
        "(2002), headwords are defined as the content words of the sentence.",
        "Therefore, headword bigrams constitute a special type of skipping bigrams which can capture dependency between two words that may not be adjacent.",
        "In reality, a large portion of headword bigrams are identical to word bigrams, as two headwords can occur next to each other in text.",
        "In the adaptation test data we used, we find that headword bigram features are for the most part either completely overlapping with the word bigram features (i.e., all instances of headword bigrams also count as word bigrams) or not overlapping at all (i.e., a headword bigram feature is not observed as a word bigram feature) – less than 20% of headword bigram features displayed a variable degree of overlap with word bigram features.",
        "In our data, the rate of completely overlapping features is 25% to 47% depending on the adaptation domain.",
        "From this, we can say that the headword bigram features show moderate to high degree of correlation with the word bigram features.",
        "We then used BLasso and F-Boosting to train the linear language models including both word bigram and headword bigram features.",
        "We find that although the CER reduction by adding",
        "headword features is overall very small, the difference between the two versions of BLasso is more visible in all four test sets.",
        "Comparing Figures 5 – 8 with Figure 4, it can be seen that BLasso with backward steps outperforms the one without backward steps in much earlier stages of training with a larger margin.",
        "For example, on Encarta data sets, BLasso outperforms F-Boosting after around 18,000 iterations with headword features (Figure 7), as opposed to 25,000 iterations without headword features (Figure 4).",
        "The results seem to corroborate our speculation that BLasso is more robust in the presence of highly correlated features.",
        "To investigate the impact of using the grid search (fixed step size) versus the continuous search (optimal step size) for feature selection, we compared F-Boosting with FSLR since they differs only in their search methods for feature selection.",
        "As shown in Figures 5 to 8, although FSLR is robust in that its test errors do not increase after many iterations, F-Boosting can reach a much lower error rate on three out of four test sets.",
        "Therefore, in the task of LM for IME where CER is the most important metric, the grid search for feature selection is more desirable.",
        "To investigate the impact of using a fixed versus an optimal step size for feature update, we compared FSLR with Boosting.",
        "Although both algorithms achieve very similar CER results, the performance of FSLR is much less sensitive to the selected fixed step size.",
        "For example, we can select any value from 0.2 to 0.8, and in most settings FSLR achieves the very similar lowest CER after 20,000 iterations, and will stay there for many iterations.",
        "In contrast, in Boosting, the optimal value of ε in Equation (16) varies with the sizes and domains of training data, and has to be tuned carefully.",
        "We thus conclude that in our task FSLR is more robust against different training settings and a fixed step size for feature update is more preferred."
