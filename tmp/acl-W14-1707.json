        "We describe our approach to grammatical error correction presented in the CoNLL Shared Task 2014.",
        "Our work is focused on error detection in sentences with a language model based on syntactic tri-grams and bi-grams extracted from dependency trees generated from 90% of the English Wikipedia.",
        "Also, we add a naive module to error correction that outputs a set of possible answers, those sentences are scored using a syntactic n-gram language model.",
        "The sentence with the best score is the final suggestion of the system.",
        "The system was ranked 11th, evidently this is a very simple approach, but since the beginning our main goal was to test the syntactic n-gram language model with a big corpus to future comparison."

        "Grammatical error correction is a difficult task to solve even for humans, because there are a lot of phenomena that can occur in a sentence.",
        "One example of the difficulty of the task is that the annotators of the training and test data in the NUCLE (Dahlmeier et al., 2013) differs in the corrections that they made to the sen-tences, those differences in the annotations are mostly because depend on uncontrolled con-ditions, such knowledge, emotional state and the environment of the annotator at the moment that the task is performed.",
        "This time the shared task is more difficult than the last year (Ng and Wu et al., 2013) that considered only five types of errors, and this time the task consist into correct all the grammatical errors in the NUCLE (Ng and Wu et al., 2014).",
        "We are interested into test the behaviour of different methods used in different NLP task with the syntactic n-grams as a resource, in order to set a baseline to future work.",
        "There is work that probes that there is an improvement using syntactic n-grams in (Sidorov and Ve-lasquez et al., 2014) where the author uses syntactic n-grams as machine learning features, another example of the use of syntactic n-grams occurred in the CoNLL 2013 Shared Task in (Sidorov and Gupta et al., CoNLL 2013), but they used a different approach from us.",
        "Until the moment we do not have a comparison with the same method that we used in this task using normal n-grams, still our hypothesis is that syntactic n-grams allow us to relate words that in a common n-gram model wouldn't be related and that can outperform the results.",
        "For example, in the sentence: \"Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .\"",
        "Some common tri-grams are \"to your chance\", \"your chance of\", \"chance of inher-iting\".",
        "The word chance can not be related to the words \"disorder\" or \"disease\", unless we use 5-grams or 7-grams, unlike with the syntactic tri-grams that as can be appreciated in the Table 3 the relation between this words are normally included.",
        "Another hypothesis is that a low probability in a syntactic n-gram is an indicator that exist a wrong token in the portion of a dependency tree.",
        "A simple example of this intuition can be seen in the Table 1 for the sentence \"This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .\"",
        "from the training data in the NUCLE.",
        "The bold words are wrong tokens annotated in the training data and the numbers are the token number in the sentence.",
        "As can be observed the low probability syntactic tri-grams include the wrong tokens.",

        "2 Resources For the language model we used a Wikipedia dump as training data (Wikipedia, 2013) and extracted the text with the Multithread Wikipedia Extractor (Souza, 2012) then was tokenized with the Stanford Tokenizer (Man- ning et al., ).",
        "There are about 87 millions of sentences and 1,480 millions of tokens.",
        "To generate the dependency trees we used the Stanford Parser 3.2 (Socher et al., 2013), but for the syntactic n-gram language model we only took 90% of the sentences randomly chosen.",
        "The parsing task took a lot of time to be made with our computing resources and we had to use threads with the Stanford Parser, unfortunately this increases the amount of memory required by the software, so we had to exclude the sentences with more than one hundred token.",
        "At the end we parsed about 75 millions of sentences.",
        "The dependency trees were generated as Stanford typed dependencies (Marneffe et al., 2006), in specific in the collapsed with propagation version as described in (Marneffe et al., 2008).",
        "One example of this kind of dependencies can be seen in the Figure 2.",
        "As can be observed the collapsed with propagation typed dependencies can break the tree, so strictly this is a directed graph with the grammatical relations in the edges and the words of the sentence in the nodes, though as convention we will continue referring it as a tree.",
        "In total there are about 1,166 million grammatical relations.",
        "In the error detection phase we used the information provided with the NUCLE (Dahlmeier et al., 2013), specifically the to-kens, POS and the grammatical relations from the test data in CoNLL style.",
        "From the training data we only made some calculations about the kinds of errors that occur with higher frequency and we used this information to include some rules in the correction phase.",
        "3 System description 3.1 Syntactic n-gram language model We used the dependency trees from Wikipedia corpus to generate the syntactic n-grams in the non-continuous form as described in (Sidorov, 2013) and in the book (Sidorov, Book 2013), but there is an significant difference, the current work with syntactic n-grams was made with the basic dependencies, and as we said before, we are using the dependencies that collapses the prepositions and propagates the conjunctions.",
        "The tree in Figure 1 is in the Basic representation and the differences with the collapsed and propagated dependencies can be appreciated in the Figure 2.",
        "This change allow us to increase the scope of the relations between content words, but also it makes difficult to find preposition errors, so our system do not consider preposition correction.",
        "The tables 2 and 3 show the syntactic tri-grams generated whit each one of the dependency representations, but without the relations for lack of space.",

        "5 Conclusions The result of the system was not good or as we expected, first because our approach is simple and was motivated to test the use of a syntactic n-grams language model, second because the poor election of candidates to correct the errors.",
        "However, this task gave us the opportunity to test the behaviour in different conditions and now we have a reference to improve our system.",
        "6 Future work We have a lot of work to do, in order to support the use of this kind of resources.",
        "First we have to compare the same method that we used, but with a common n-gram language model.",
        "Second is necessary to make a more general language model that can be used with syntactic 4-grams or more, and analyse how this increase can affect the recall.",
        "Third find a way to made more efficient the consult of the resources.",
        "Also we need to add a more wise method to correct the detected errors, including prepositions.",
        "The fact that we did not take into account this type of error does not mean that is not possible to do it with this resources, so we have to propose an alternative that takes into account this and other types of errors.",
