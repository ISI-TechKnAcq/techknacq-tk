        "AutoTutor is a domain-portable intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with current versions in the domains of physics and computer literacy (Graesser et al.",
        "1999; Olney et al.",
        "2002).",
        "AutoTutor, like many other ITSs, is an intersection of applications, including tutoring, mixed-initiative dialogue, and question answering.",
        "In each of these, utterance classification, particularly question classification, plays a critical role.",
        "In tutoring, utterance classification can be used to track the student's level of understanding.",
        "Contribution and question classifications can both play a role: contributions may be compared to an expected answer (Graesser et al.",
        "2001) and questions may be scored by how \"deep\" they are.",
        "For example, The PREG model (Otero and Graesser 2001) predicts under what circumstances students will ask \"deep\" questions, i.e. those that reveal a greater level of cognitive processing than who, what, when, or where questions.",
        "A student who is only asking shallow questions, or no questions at all, is predicted by PREG to not have a situation-level understanding (van Dijk and Kintsch 1983) and thus to learn less and forget faster.",
        "The key point is that different metrics for tracking student understanding are applicable to questions and contributions.",
        "Distinguishing them via classification is a first step to applying a metric.",
        "In mixed-initiative dialog systems, utterance classification can be used to detect shifts in initiative.",
        "For example, a mixed-initiative system that asks, \"Where would you like to travel\", could respond to the question, \"Where can I travel for $200?\"",
        "(Allen 1999) by giving a list of cities.",
        "In this example, the user is taking the initiative by requesting more information.",
        "In order to respond properly, the system must detect that the user has taken initiative before it can respond appropriately; otherwise it might try to interpret the user's utterance as a travel destination.",
        "In this sense, questions mark redirection of the dialogue, whereas contributions are continuations of the dialogue.",
        "In order for a user to redirect the dialogue and thus exercise initiative, a mixed-initiative system must be able to distinguish questions and contributions.",
        "Question classification as early as Lehnert (1978) has been used as a basis for answering questions, a trend that continues today (Voorhees 2001).",
        "A common feature of these question-answering systems is that they first determine the expected answer type implicit in the question.",
        "For example, \"How much does a pretzel cost\" might be classified according to the answer type of MONEY or QUANTITY.",
        "Knowledge of the expected answer type can be used to narrow the search space for the answer, either online (Brill et al.",
        "2001) or in a database (Harabagiu et al.",
        "2000).",
        "Accordingly, question answering calls for a finer discrimination of question types as opposed to only distinguishing questions from contributions.",
        "AutoTutor uses utterance classification to track student progress, to determine initiative, and to answer questions.",
        "By virtue of being embedded in AutoTutor, the utterance classifier presented here has an unusual set of constraints, both practical and theoretical.",
        "On the practical side, AutoTutor is a web-based application that performs in real time; thus utterance classification must also proceed in real time.",
        "For that reason, the classifier uses a minimum of resources, including part of speech tagging (Brill 1995; Sekine and Grishman 1995) and cascaded finite state transducers defining the categories.",
        "Theoretically speaking, AutoTutor must also recognize questions in a meaningful way to both question answering and tutoring.",
        "The question taxonomy utilized, that of Graesser et al. (1992), is an extension of Lehnert's (1978) taxonomy for question answering and has been applied to human tutoring (Graesser et al.",
        "1992; Graesser and Person 1994).",
        "This paper outlines the utterance classifier and quantifies its performance.",
        "In particular, Section 2 presents AutoTutor.",
        "Section 3 presents the utterance taxonomy.",
        "Section 4 describes the classifier algorithm.",
        "Section 5 delineates the training process and results.",

        "1992; Graesser and Person 1994).",
        "The most notable system within this framework is QUALM (Lehnert 1978), which utilizes twelve of the question categories.",
        "The taxonomy can be divided into 3 distinct groups, questions, frozen expressions, and contributions.",
        "Each of these will be discussed in turn.",
        "The conceptual basis of the question categories arises from the observation that the same question may be asked in different ways, e.g. \"What happened?\"",
        "and \"How did this happen?\"",
        "Correspondingly, a single lexical stem for a question, like \"What\" can be polysemous, e.g. both in a definition category, \"What is the definition of gravity?\"",
        "and metacommunicative, \"What did you say?\"",
        "Furthermore, implicit questions can arise in tutoring via directives and some assertions, e.g. \"Tell me about gravity\" and \"I don't know what gravity is.\"",
        "In AutoTutor these information seeking utterances are classified to one of the 16 question categories.",
        "The emphases on queried concepts rather than orthographic forms make the categories listed in Table 1 bear a strong resemblance to speech acts.",
        "Indeed, Graesser et al.",
        "(1992) propose that the categories be distinguished in precisely the same way as speech acts, using semantic, conceptual, and pragmatic criteria as opposed to syntactic and lexical criteria.",

        "It is particularly pertinent to the present discussion that the sixteen qualitative categories are employed in a quantitative classification process.",
        "That is to say that for the present purposes of classification, a question must belong to one and only one category.",
        "On the one hand this idealization is necessary to obtain easily analyzed performance data and to create a well-balanced training corpus.",
        "On the other hand, it is not entirely accurate because some questions may be assigned to multiple categories, suggesting a polythetic coding scheme (Graesser et al.",
        "1992).",

        "AutoTutor responds to metacognitive utterances with canned expressions such as, \"Why don't you give me what you know, and we'll take it from there.\"",
        "Metacommunicative acts likewise refer to the dialogue between tutor and student, often calling for a repetition of the tutor's last utterance.",
        "Two key points are worth noting: frozen expressions have a much smaller variability than questions or contributions, and frozen expressions may be followed by some content, making them more properly treated as questions.",
        "For example, \"I don't understand\" is frozen, but \"I don't understand gravity\" is a more appropriately a question.",
