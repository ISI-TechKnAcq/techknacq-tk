        "Selectional preferences, which characterize typical arguments of predicates, are a very useful and versatile knowledge source.",
        "They have been used for example for syntactic disambiguation (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (WSD) (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "The corpus-based induction of selectional preferences was first proposed by Resnik (1996).",
        "All later approaches have followed the same two-step procedure, first collecting argument headwords from a corpus, then generalizing to other, similar words.",
        "Some approaches have used WordNet for the generalization step (Resnik, 1996; Clark and Weir, 2001; Abe and Li, 1993), others EM-based clustering (Rooth et al., 1999).",
        "In this paper we propose a new, simple model for selectional preference induction that uses corpus-based semantic similarity metrics, such as Cosine or Lin's (1998) mutual information-based metric, for the generalization step.",
        "This model does not require any manually created lexical resources.",
        "In addition, the corpus for computing the similarity metrics can be freely chosen, allowing greater variation in the domain of generalization than a fixed lexical resource.",
        "We focus on one application of selectional preferences: semantic role labeling.",
        "The argument positions for which we compute selectional preferences will be semantic roles in the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) paradigm, and the predicates we consider will be semantic classes of words rather than individual words (which means that different preferences will be learned for different senses of a predicate word).",
        "In SRL, the two most pressing issues today are (1) the development of strong semantic features to complement the current mostly syntactically-based systems, and (2) the problem of the domain dependence (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "In the CoNLL-05 shared task, participating systems showed about 10 points F-score difference between in-domain and out-of-domain test data.",
        "Concerning (1), we focus on selectional preferences as the strongest candidate for informative semantic features.",
        "Concerning (2), the corpus-based similarity metrics that we use for selectional preference induction open up interesting possibilities of mixing domains.",
        "We evaluate the similarity-based model against Resnik's WordNet-based model as well as the EM-based clustering approach.",
        "In the evaluation, the similarity-model shows lower error rates than both Resnik's WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering model.",
        "However, the EM-based clustering model has higher coverage than both other paradigms.",

        "Since we are using a cutoff of 500 similar words computed per word in S, the size of like(S) can only vary if the same word is suggested as similar for several seen headwords in S. This way, the size of like(S) functions as an indicator of the degree of uniformity or similarity that a similarity metric \"perceives\" among the members of S. To facilitate comparison across frequency bands, line (c) normalizes by the size of S, showing |llk|'S|S')| micro-averaged over all roles.",

        "The semantic role Vehicle of the Ride_vehicle frame and the role Substance of In-gest_substance are both typically realized as the direct object of \"take\".",
        "The table only shows new induced headwords; seen headwords were omitted from the list.",
        "The particular implementation of the similarity-based model we have chosen, using frames and roles as predicates and arguments in the primary corpus, should enable the model to compute preferences specific to word senses.",
        "The sample in Table 6 shows that this is indeed the case: The preferences differ considerably for the two senses (frames) of \"take\", at least for the Jaccard metric, which shows a clear preference for vehicles for the Vehicle role.",
        "The Substance role of Ingest_substance is harder to characterize, with very diverse seen headwords such as \"crack\", \"lines\", \"fluid\", \"speed\".",
        "While the highest-ranked induced words for Jaccard do include three food items, there is no word, with the possible exception of \"ice cream\", that could be construed as a controlled substance.",
        "The induced headwords for the Cosine metric are considerably less pertinent for both roles and show the above-mentioned tendency to repeat some high-frequency words.",
        "The inspection of \"take\" anecdotally confirms that different selectional preferences are learned for different senses.",
        "This point (which comes down to the usability of selectional preferences for WSD) should be verified in an empirical evaluation, possibly in another pseudo-disambiguation task, choosing as confounders seen headwords for other senses of a predicate word."

      "text": [
        "We have introduced the similarity-based model for inducing selectional preferences.",
        "Computing selectional preference as a weighted sum of similarities to seen headwords, it is a straightforward implementation of the idea of generalization from seen headwords to other, similar words.",
        "The similarity-based model is particularly simple and easy to compute, and seems not very sensitive to parameters.",
        "Like the EM-based clustering model, it is not dependent on lexical resources.",
        "It is, however, more flexible in that it induces similarities from a separate generalization corpus, which allows us to control the similarities we compute by the choice of text domain for the generalization corpus.",
        "In this paper we have used the model to compute sense-specific selectional preferences for semantic roles.",
        "In a pseudo-disambiguation task the similarity-based model showed error rates down to 0.16, far lower than both EM-based clustering and Resnik's WordNet model.",
        "However its coverage is considerably lower than that of EM-based clustering, comparable to Resnik's model.",
        "The most probable reason for this is the sparsity of the underlying vector space.",
        "The choice of similarity metric is critical in similarity-based models, with Jaccard and Lin achieving the best performance, and Cosine surprisingly bringing up the rear.",
        "Next steps will be to test the similarity-based model \"in vivo\", in an SRL task; to test the model in a WSD task; to evaluate the model on a primary corpus that is not semantically analyzed, for greater comparability to previous approaches; to explore other vector spaces to address the coverage issue; and to experiment on domain transfer, using an appropriate generalization corpus to induce selectional preferences for a domain different from that of the primary corpus.",
        "This is especially relevant in view of the domain-dependence problem that SRL faces.",
