        "Instead our learner exploits a property called neighborhooddistinctness, which is shared by all of the target patterns.",
        "Some consequences of this approach include a natural explanation for the occurrence of binary and ternary rhythmic patterns, the lack of higher nary rhythms, and the fact that, in these systems, stress always falls within a certain window of word edges."

        "Stress assignment in QI languages is indifferent to the weight of a syllable.",
        "For example, Latin is quantity-sensitive (QS) because stress assignment depends on the syllable type: if the penultimate syllable is heavy (i.e. has a long vowel or coda) then it receives stress, but otherwise the antepenult does.",
        "The stress systems under consideration here, unlike Latin, do not distinguish syllable types.",
        "There are 27 types of QI stress systems found in Gordon’s (2002) typology.",
        "Gordon adds six plausibly attestable QI systems by considering the behavior of all-light-syllabled words from QS systems.",
        "These 33 patterns are divided into four kinds: single, dual, binary and ternary.",
        "Single systems have one stressed syllable per word, and dual systems up to two.",
        "Binary and ternary systems stress every second (binary) or third (ternary) syllable.",
        "The choice to study QI stress systems was made for three reasons.",
        "First, they are well studied and the typology is well established (Hayes, 1995; Gordon, 2002).",
        "Secondly, learning of stress systems has been approached before (Dresher and Kaye, 1990; Gupta and Touretzky, 1991; Goldsmith, 1994; Tesar, 1998) making it possible to compare learners and results.",
        "Third, these patterns have been analyzed with adjacency restrictions (e.g. no clash), as disharmony (e.g. a primary stress may not be followed by another), and with recurrence requirements (e.g. build trochaic feet iteratively from the left).",
        "Thus the patterns found in the QI stress systems are representative of other phonotactic domains that the learner should eventually be extended to.",
        "The 33 types are shown in Table 1.",
        "See Gordon (2002) and Hayes (1995) for details, examples, and original sources.",

        "This is especially true of phonotactics: reduplication and metathesis, which have higher complexity, are not phonotactic patterns as they involve alternations.3 Formally, regular languages are widely studied in computer science, and their basic properties are well understood (Hopcroft et al., 2001).",
        "Also, a learning literature exists.",
