        "We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text.",
        "The most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement (K = 0.63) that we obtained using versions of Hawkins's and Prince's classification schemes; better results (K = 0.76) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, first-mention and subsequent-mention.",

        "The work presented in this paper was inspired by the growing realization in the field of computational linguistics of the need for experimental evaluation of linguistic theories – semantic theories, in our case.",
        "The evaluation we are considering typically takes the form of experiments in which human subjects are asked to annotate texts from a corpus (or recordings of spoken conversations) according to a given classification scheme, and the agreement among their annotations is measured (see, for example, Passonneau and Litman 1993 or the papers in Moore and Walker 1997).",
        "These attempts at evaluation are, in part, motivated by the desire to put these theories on a more \"scientific\" footing by ensuring that the semantic judgments on which they are based reflect the intuitions of a large number of speakers;1 but experimental evaluation is also seen as a necessary precondition for the kind of system evaluation done, for example, in the Message Understanding initiative (MUC), where the performance of a system is evaluated by comparing its output on a collection of texts with a standardized annotation of those texts produced by humans (Chinchor and Sundheim 1995).",
        "Clearly,",
        "a MUC-style evaluation presupposes an annotation scheme on which all participants agree.",
        "Our own concern are semantic judgments concerning the interpretation of noun phrases with the definite article the, that we will call definite descriptions, following (Russell 1919).2 These noun phrases are one of the most common constructs in English,' and have been extensively studied by linguists, philosophers, psychologists, and computational linguists (Russell 1905; Christophersen 1939; Strawson 1950; Clark 1977; Grosz 1977; Cohen 1978; Hawkins 1978; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979; Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981; Heim 1982; Appelt 1985; Li5bner 1985; Kadmon 1987; Carter 1987; Bosch and Geurts 1989; Neale 1990; Kronfeld 1990; Fraurud 1990; Barker 1991; Dale 1992; Cooper 1993; Kamp and Reyle 1993; Poesio 1993).",
        "Theories of definite descriptions such as (Christophersen 1939; Hawkins 1978; Webber 1979; Prince 1981; Heim 1982) identify two subtasks involved in the interpretation of a definite description: deciding whether the definite description is related to an antecedent in the texe – which in turn may involve recognizing fairly fine-grained distinctions-and, if so, identifying this antecedent.",
        "Some of these theories have been cast in the form of classification schemes (Hawkins 1978; Prince 1992), and have been used for corpus analysis (Prince 1981, 1992; Fraurud 1990);5 yet, we are aware of no attempt at verifying whether subjects not trained in linguistics are capable of recognizing the proposed distinctions, which is a precondition for using these schemes for the kind of large-scale text annotation exercises necessary to evaluate a system's performance, as done in muc.",
        "In the past two or three years, this kind of verification has been attempted for other aspects of semantic interpretation: by Passonneau and Litman (1993) for segmentation and by Kowtko, Isard, and Doherty (1992) and Carletta et al.",
        "(1997) for dialogue act annotation.",
        "Our intention was to do the same for definite descriptions.",
        "We ran two experiments to determine how good naive subjects are at doing the form of linguistic analysis presupposed by current schemes for classifying definite descriptions.",
        "(By \"how good\" here we mean \"how much do they agree among themselves?\" as commonly assumed in work of this kind.)",
        "Our subjects were asked to classify the definite descriptions found in a corpus of natural language texts according to classification schemes that we developed starting from the taxonomies proposed by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981, 1992), but which took into account our intention of having naive speakers perform the classification.",
        "Our experiments were also designed to assess the feasibility of a system to process definite descriptions on unrestricted text and to collect data that could be used for this implementation.",
        "For both of these reasons, the classification schemes that we tried differ in several respects from those adopted in prior corpus-based studies such as Prince (1981) and Fraurud (1990).",
        "Our study is also different from these previous ones in that measuring the agreement among annotators became an issue (Carletta 1996).",
        "For the experiments, we used a set of randomly selected articles from the Wall Street Journal contained in the ACL/DCI CD-ROM, rather than a corpus of transcripts of spoken language corpora such as the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al.",
        "1991) or the TRAINS corpus (Heeman and Allen 1995).",
        "The main reason for this choice was",
        "to avoid dealing with deictic uses of definite descriptions and with phenomena such as reference failure and repair.",
        "A second reason was that we intended to use computer simulations of the classification task to supplement the results of our experiments, and we needed a parsed corpus for this purpose; the articles we chose were all part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we review two existing classification schemes in Section 2 and then discuss our two classification experiments in Sections 3 and 4."

        "When looking for an annotation scheme for definite descriptions, one is faced with a wide range of options.",
        "At one end of the spectrum there are mostly descriptive lists of definite description uses, such as those in Christophersen (1939) and Hawkins (1978), whose only goal is to assign a classification to all uses of definite descriptions.",
        "At the other end, there are highly developed formal analyses, such as Russell (1905), Heim (1982), Liibner (1985), Kadmon (1987), Neale (1990), Barker (1991), and Kamp and Reyle (1993), in which the compositional contribution of definite descriptions to the meaning of an utterance, as well as their truth-conditional properties, are spelled out in detail.",
        "These more formal analyses are concerned with questions such as the quantificational or nonquantificational status of definite descriptions and the proper treatment of presuppositions, but tend to concentrate on a subset of the full range of definite description use.",
        "Among the more developed semantic analyses, some identify uniqueness as the defining property of definite descriptions (Russell 1905; Neale 1990), whereas others take familiarity as the basis for the analysis (Christophersen 1939; Hawkins 1978; Heim 1982; Prince 1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993).",
        "We will say more about some of these analyses below.",
        "Our choice of a classification scheme was dictated in part by the intended use of the annotation, in part by methodological considerations.",
        "An annotation used to evaluate the performance of a system ought to identify the anaphoric connections between discourse entities; this makes familiarity-based analyses more attractive.",
        "From a methodological point of view, it was important to choose an annotation scheme that (i) would make the classification task doable by subjects not trained in linguistics, and (ii) had already been applied to the task of corpus analysis.",
        "We felt that we could ask naive subjects to assign each definite description to one of a few classes and to identify its antecedent when appropriate; we also wanted an annotation scheme that would characterize the whole range of definite description use, so that we would not need to worry about eliminating definite .descriptions from our texts because they were unclassifiable.",
        "For these reasons, we chose Hawkins's list of definite description uses (Hawkins 1978) and Prince's taxonomy (Prince 1981, 1992) as our starting point, and developed from there two slightly different annotation schemes, which allowed us to see whether it was better to describe the classes to our annotators in a surface-oriented or a semantic fashion, and to evaluate the seriousness of the problems with these schemes identified in the literature (see Fraurud 1990)."

        "We will then say, following Sidner's terminology (Sidner 1979), that a definite description cospecifies with its antecedent in a text, when such antecedent exists, if the definite description and its antecedent denote the same object.",

        "Associative Anaphoric Use.",

        "Many authors, including Hawkins himself, have attempted to go beyond the purely descriptive list just discussed.",
        "Poesio and Vieira A Corpus-based Investigation of Definite Description Use One group of authors have identified uniqueness as the defining property of definite descriptions.",

        "The hypothesis was developed in recent years to address the problem of uniqueness within small situations (Kadmon 1987; Neale 1990; Cooper 1993).7 Another line of research is based on the observation that many of the uses of definite descriptions listed by Hawkins have one property in common: the speaker (or writer) is making some assumptions about what the hearer (or reader) already knows.",
        "Speaking very loosely, we might say that the speaker assumes that the hearer is able to \"identify\" the referent of the definite description.",

        "The average percentage of discourse-new descriptions (larger situation and unfamiliar together) is 46%, against an average of 50% in the first experiment.",
        "Having split the discourse-new class in two in this experiment, we got an indication of the relative importance of the hearer-old and hearer-new subclasses – about half of the discourse-new uses fall in each of these classes – but only very approximate, since the first two annotators classified the majority of these definite descriptions as larger situation, whereas the last annotator classified the majority as unfamiliar.",
        "As expected, the broader definition of the coreferent class resulted in a larger percentage of definite descriptions being included in this class (an average of 45%), and a smaller percentage being included in the bridging reference class.",
        "Considering the difference between the relative importance of the same-head anaphora class in the first experiment and of the coreferent class in the second experiment we can estimate that approximately 15% of definite descriptions are coreferential and have a different head from their antecedents.",
        "4.4.2 Agreement among Annotators.",
        "The agreement among annotators in Experiment 2 was not very high: 61% total agreement, which gives K = 0.58 or K = 0.63, depending on whether we consider doubts as a class.'",
        "This value is worse than the one we obtained in Experiment 1 (K = 0.68 or K = 0.73); in fact, this value of K goes below the level at which we can tentatively assume agreement among the annotators.",
        "There could be several reasons for the fact that agreement got worse in this second experiment.",
        "Perhaps the simplest explanation is that we were just using more classes.",
        "In order to check whether this was the case, we merged the classes larger situation and unfamiliar back into one class, as we had in the Experiment 1: that is, we recomputed K after counting all definite descriptions classified as either larger situation or unfamiliar as members of the same class.",
        "And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K = 0.63 to K = 0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., within the \"tentative\" margins of agreement according to Carletta (1996) (0.68 < x < 0.8).",
        "The remaining difference between the level of agreement obtained in this experiment and that obtained in the first one (K = 0.73, ignoring doubts) might have to do with the annotators, with the difficulty of the texts, or with using a syntactic (same head) as opposed to a semantic notion of what counts as coreferential; we are inclined to think that the last two explanations are more likely.",
        "For one thing, we found very few examples of true mistakes in the annotation, as discussed below.",
        "Secondly, we observed that the coefficient of agreement changes dramatically from text to text: in this second experiment, it varies from K = 0.42 to K = 0.92 depending on the text, and if we do not count the three worst texts in the second experiment, we get again K = 0.73.",
        "Third, going from a syntactic to a semantic definition of anaphoric definite description resulted in worse agreement both for coreferential and for bridging ref",
        "erences: looking at the per-class figures, one can see that we went from a per-class agreement on anaphoric definite descriptions in Experiment 1 of 88% to a per-class agreement on coreferential definites of 86% in Experiment 2; and the per-class agreement for associative definite descriptions of 59% went down rather dramatically to a per-class agreement of 31% on bridging descriptions.",
        "The good result obtained by reducing the number of classes led us to try to find a way of grouping definite descriptions into classes that would result in an even better agreement.",
        "An obvious idea was to try with still fewer classes, i.e., just two.",
        "We first tried the binary division suggested by Fraurud: all coreferential definite descriptions 7 on one side (subsequent-mention), and all other definite descriptions on the other (first-mention).",
        "Splitting things this way did result in an agreement of K = 0.76, i.e., almost a good reliability, although not quite as strong an agreement as we would have expected.",
        "The alternative of putting in one class all discourse-related definite descriptions – coreferential and bridging references – and putting larger situation and unfamiliar definite descriptions in a second class resulted in a worse agreement, although not by much (K = 0.73).",
        "This suggests that our subjects did reasonably well at distinguishing first-mention from subsequent-mention entities, but not at drawing more complex distinctions.",
        "They were particularly bad at distinguishing bridging references from other definite descriptions: dividing the classifications into bridging definites, on the one hand, and all other definite descriptions, on the other, resulted in a very low agreement (K = 0.24).",
        "We obtained about the same results by computing the per-class percentage of agreement discussed in Section 3.",
        "The rates of agreement for each class thus obtained are presented in Table 9.",
        "Again, we find that the annotators found it easier to agree on co-referential definite descriptions, harder to agree on bridging references; the percentage agreement on the classes larger situation and unfamiliar taken individually is much lower than the agreement on the class larger situation/unfamiliar taken as a whole.",
        "The results in Table 9 confirm the indications obtained by computing agreement for a smaller number of classes: our subjects agree pretty much on coreferential definite descriptions, but bridging references are not a natural class.",
        "We discuss the cases of disagreement in more detail next.",
        "among annotators: about classification, and about the identification of an antecedent.",
        "There were 29 cases of complete classification disagreement among annotators, i.e., cases in which no two annotators classified a definite description in the same way, and 144 cases of partial disagreement.",
        "All four of the possible combinations of total disagreement were observed, but the two most common combinations were BCU (bridging, coreferential, and unfamiliar) and BLU (bridging, larger situation, and unfamiliar); all six combinations of partial disagreements were also observed.",
        "As we",
        "do not have the space to discuss each case in detail, we will concentrate on pointing out what we take to be the most interesting observations, especially from the perspective of designing a corpus annotation scheme for anaphoric expressions.",
        "We found very few true mistakes.",
        "We had some problems due to the presence of idioms such as they had to pick up the slack or on the whole.",
        "But in general, most of the disagreements were due to genuine problems in assigning a unique classification to definite descriptions.",
        "The mistakes that our annotators did make were of the form exemplified by (22).",
        "In this case, all three annotators indicate the same antecedent (the potential payoff) for the definite description the rewards, but whereas two of them classify the rewards as coreferential, one of them classifies it as bridging.",
        "What seems to be happening here and in similar cases is that even though we asked the subjects to classify semantically, they ended up using a notion of relatedness that is more like the notion of associative in Experiment 1.",
        "(We found 10 such cases of partial disagreement between bridging and coreferential in which all three subjects indicated the same antecedent for the definite description.)",
        "(22) New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer.",
        "\"When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.\" A particularly interesting version of this problem appears in the following example, when two annotators took the verb to refund as antecedent of the definite description the refund, but one of them interpreted the definite as coreferential with the eventuality, the other as bridging.",
        "(23) Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $250 million to",
        "its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant.",
        "The refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility.",
        "As could be expected by the discussion of the K results above, the most common disagreements (35 cases of partial disagreement out of 144) were between the classes larger situation and unfamiliar.",
        "One typical source of disagreement was the introductory use of definite descriptions, common in newspapers: thus, for example, some of our annotators would classify the Illinois Commerce Commission as larger situation, others as unfamiliar.",
        "In many cases in which this form of ambiguity was encountered, the definite description worked effectively as a proper name: the worldwide supercomputer law, the new US trade law, or the face of personal computing.",
        "Rather surprisingly, from a semantic perspective, the second most common form of disagreement was between the coreferential and bridging classes.",
        "In this case, the problem typically was that different subjects would choose different antecedents for a certain definite description.",
        "Thus, in example (23), the third annotator indicated $250 million as the antecedent for the refund, and classified the definite description as",
        "Poesio and Vieira A Corpus-based Investigation of Definite Description Use coreferential.",
        "A similar example is (24), in which two of the annotators classified the spinoff as bridging on spinoff Cray Computer Corp., whereas the third classified it as coreferential with the pending spinoff (24) The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity – and longevity – of its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray.",
        "Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.",
        "While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May, the strings it attached to the financing hadn't been made public until yesterday.",
        "An example of total (BLU) disagreement is the following:",
        "(25) Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem,",
        "who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.",
        "In this case, we can see that all three interpretations are acceptable: we may take the definite description the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, either as a case of bridging reference on the previously mentioned Argentina, or as a larger situation use, or as a case of unfamiliar definite description, especially if we assume that this latter class coincides with Prince's containing inferrables.",
        "In conclusion, our figures can be seen as an empirical verification of Fraurud's and Prince's hypothesis that the classification disagreements among annotators depend to a large extent on the task they are asked to do, rather than reflecting true differences in semantic intuitions.",
        "about the antecedent of a definite description.",
        "We have already discussed the most common case of antecedent disagreement: the case in which a definite description could equally well be taken as co-referential with one discourse entity or as bridging to another.",
        "For example, in an article in which the writer starts discussing Aetna Life & Casualty, and then goes on mentioning major insurers, either discourse entity could then serve as antecedent for the subsequent definite description the insurer, depending on whether the definite description is classified as coreferential or bridging.",
        "Perhaps the most interesting cases of disagreement about the antecedent are examples such as (26).",
        "One subject indicated parts of the factory as the antecedent; another indicated the factory; and the third indicated areas of the factory.",
        "dusty where the crocidolite was used.",
        "Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.",
        "Workers described \"clouds of blue dust\" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area.",
        "What's interesting about this example is that the text does not provide us with enough information to decide about the correct interpretation; it is as if the writer didn't think it necessary for the reader to assign an unambiguous interpretation to the definite description.",
        "Similar cases of underspecified definite descriptions have been observed before (e.g., Nunberg's John shot himself in the foot [1978] or I'm going to the store mentioned in Clark and Marshall [19811) but no real account has been given of the conditions under which they are possible."

        "5.1.1 Consequences for Corpus Annotation.",
        "This study raises the issue of how feasible it is to annotate corpora for anaphoric information.",
        "We observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions: first, neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators; and second, even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions (i.e., coreferential and bridging) is problematic – we only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of coreferential definite descriptions, and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and coreference were allowed.",
        "These results indicate that annotating corpora for anaphoric information may be more difficult than expected.",
        "The task of indicating a unique antecedent for bridging definite descriptions appears to be especially challenging, for the reasons discussed above (multiple equally good antecedents and referential underspecification, for example).",
        "On the positive side, we have two observations: our subjects did reasonably well at distinguishing fir§t-mention from subsequent-mention antecedents, and at identifying the antecedent of a subsequent-mention definite description.",
        "A classification scheme based on this distinction (such as Fraurud's) that just asked subjects to indicate an antecedent for subsequent-mention definite descriptions may have a chance of resulting in a standardized annotation.",
        "Even in this case, however, the agreement we observed was not very high, but better results may be obtained with more training.",
        "The possibility we are exploring is that these results might get better if annotators are given computer support in the form of a semiautomatic classifier – i.e., a system capable of suggesting to annotators a classification for definite descriptions, including possibly an indication of how reliable the classification might be.",
        "We briefly discuss below our progress in this direction so far.",
        "5.1.2 Consequences for Linguistic Theory.",
        "Our study confirms the findings of previous work (e.g., Fraurud [1990]) that a great number of definite descriptions in texts are discourse-new: in our second experiment we found an equal number of discourse-new and discourse-related definite descriptions, although many of the definite descriptions classified as discourse-new could be seen as associative in a loose sense.",
        "Interestingly, this suggests that each of the competing hypotheses about the licensing conditions for definite descriptions – the uniqueness and the familiarity theory accounts – accounts satisfactorily for about half of the data.",
        "Poesio and Vieira A Corpus-based Investigation of Definite Description Use Of the existing theories of definite descriptions, the one that comes closest to accounting for all of the uses of definite descriptions that we observed is LObner 's (1985).",
        "LObner proposes that the defining property of definite descriptions, from a semantic point of view, is that they indicate that the head noun complex denotes a functional concept, i.e., a function which, according to Lamer, can take one, two, or three arguments.",
        "He argues that some head noun complexes denote such a function on purely lexical semantic grounds: this is the case, for example, of the head noun complexes in the father of Mr. Smith, the first man to sail to America and the fact that life started on Earth; he calls these definite descriptions semantic definites.",
        "In other cases, such as the dog, the head noun by itself would not denote a function, but a sort: in these cases, according to LObner, the use of a definite description is only felicitous if context indicates the function to be used.",
        "This latter class of pragmatic definites includes the best-known cases of familiar definites – anaphoric, immediate and visible situation, and larger situation – as well as some cases classified by Hawkins as unfamiliar and by Prince as containing inferrables.",
        "Liibner does not discuss the conditions under which a writer can assume that the reader can recognize that context creates a functional concept out of a sortal one, but his account could be supplemented by Clark and Marshall's theory of what may count as a basis for a mutual knowledge induction schema (Clark and Marshall 198418",
        "scriptions are so numerous, and that recognizing them does not depend on commonsense knowledge alone, we conclude that any general theory of definite description interpretation should include methods for recognizing such definites.",
        "The architecture of our own classifier (see below) is also consistent with Fraurud's hypothesis that these methods are not just used when no suitable antecedent can be found, but more extensive investigations will be needed before we can conclude that this architecture significantly outperforms other ones.",
        "The presence of such a large number of discourse-new definite descriptions is also problematic for the idea that definite descriptions are interpreted with respect to the global focus (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "A significant percentage of the larger situation definite descriptions encountered in our corpus cannot be said to be in the global focus in any significant sense: as we observed above, in many of these cases the writer seems to rely on the reader's capability to add a new object such as the Illinois Commerce Commission to her or his model of the world, rather than expecting that object to be already present."
