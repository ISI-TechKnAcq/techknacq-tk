        "From a certain (admittedly narrow) perspective, one of the annoying features of natural language is the ubiquitous syntactic ambiguity.",
        "For a computational model intended to assign syntactic descriptions to natural language text, this seem like a design defect.",
        "In general, when context and lexical content are taken into account, such syntactic ambiguity can be resolved: sentences used in context show, for the most part, little ambiguity.",
        "But the grammar provides many alternative analyses, and gives little guidance about resolving the ambiguity.",
        "Prepositional phrase attachment is the canonical case of structural ambiguity, as in the time worn example,",
        "The problem arises because the grammar provides several sources for prepositional phrases.",
        "The prepositional phrase with the telescope has two central attachment possibilities (the seeing is by means of a telescope or the man has a telescope), licensed by two different phrase structure rules, namely VP -->.",
        "NP PP and NP --).",
        "N' PP (The prepositional phrase might also attach to the subject noun phrase I; in this paper we will concentrate on the most important binary choice between attachment to the adjacent Noun Phrase, and attachment to the preceding Verb.)",
        "The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for understanding and for language models.",
        "It looks like it might require extremely complex computation to determine what attaches to what.",
        "Indeed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text must be reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988).",
        "Of course, if attachment ambiguity demands reference to semantics and discourse models, there is little hope in the near term of building computational models for unrestricted text to resolve the ambiguity.",
        "Structure based ambiguity resolution There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.",
        "The two main ones are:",
        "• Right Association - a constituent tends to attach to another constituent immediately to its right (Kimball 1973).",
        "• Minimal Attachment - a constituent tends to attach so as to involve the fewest additional syntactic nodes (Frazier 1978).",
        "For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb + object context as in sentence (1), these two principles – at least in the version of syntax that Frazier assumes – make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.",
        "Unfortunately, these structure-based disambiguation proposals seem not to account for attachment preferences very well.",
        "A recent study of attachment of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a \"Wizard of Oz\" travel information experiment shows that niether Right Association nor Minimal Attachment account for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore et al.",
        "1990).",
        "And experiments by Taraban and McClelland (1988) show that the structural models are not in fact good predictors of people's behavior in resolving ambiguity."

        "Similarly, Taraban and McClelland found lexical content was key in explaining people's behavior.",
        "Various previous proposals for guiding attachment disambiguation by the lexical content of specific words have appeared (e.g. Ford, Bres-nan, and Kaplan 1982; Marcus 1980).",
        "Unfortunately, it is not clear where the necessary information about lexical preferences is to be found.",
        "In the Whittemore et al.",
        "study, the judgement of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for exactly the cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was available.",
        "Thus, we are posed with the problem: how can we get a good list of lexical preferences.",
        "Our proposal is to use cooccurrence of with prepositions in text as an indicator of lexical preference.",
        "Thus, for example, the preposition to occurs frequently in the context send NP – , i.e., after the object of the verb send, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to.",
        "Similarly, from occurs frequently in the context withdrawal – , and this is evidence of a lexical association of the noun withdrawal with the preposition from.",
        "Of course, this kind of association is, unlike lexical preference, a symmetric notion.",
        "Cooccurrence provides no indication of whether the verb is selecting the preposition or vice versa.",
        "We will treat the association as a property of the pair of words.",
        "It is a separate matter, which we unfortunately cannot pursue here, to assign the association to a particular linguistic licensing relation.",
        "The suggestion which we want to explore is that the association revealed by textual distribution – whether its source is a complementation relation, a modification relation, or something else – gives us information needed to resolve the prepositional attachment."

        "This dictionary is appropriate for comparing with the AP sample for several reasons: it was compiled on the basis of a large text corpus, and thus may be less subject to idiosyncrasy than more arbitrarily constructed works; and it provides, in a separate field, a direct indication of prepositions typically associated with many nouns and verbs.",
        "From a machine-readable version of the dictionary, we extracted a list of 1535 nouns associated with a particular preposition, and of 1193 verbs associated with a particular preposition after an object noun phrase.",
        "These 2728 associations are many fewer than the number of associations found in the AP sample.",

        "On the other hand, the lack of overlap for so many cases – assuming that the dictionary and the significant bigrams actually record important preposition associations – indicates that 1) our sample is too small, and 2) the dictionary coverage is widely scattered.",
        "First, we note that the dictionary chooses attachments in 182 cases of the 889 test sentences.",
        "Seven of these are cases where the dictionary finds an association between the preposition and both the noun and the verb.",
        "In these cases, of course, the dictionary provides no information to help in choosing the correct attachment.",
        "Looking at the 175 cases where the dictionary finds one and only one association for the preposition, we can ask how well it does in predicting the correct attachment.",
        "Here the results are no better than our human judges or than our bigram procedure.",
        "Of the 175 cases, in 25 cases the dictionary finds a verb association when the correct association is with the noun.",

        "The particular approach to deciding attachment by t-score gives results nearly as good as human judges given the same information.",
