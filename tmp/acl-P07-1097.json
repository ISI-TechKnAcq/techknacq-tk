        "The emergence of question answering (QA) systems for addressing complex information needs has ne cessitated the development and refinement of new methodologies for evaluating and comparing systems.",
        "In the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) QA Complex questions are distinguished from factoid tracks organized by the U.S. National Institute of questions such as \"Who shot Abraham Lincoln?\"",
        "in Standards and Technology (NIST), improvements in that they cannot be answered by named entities (e.g., evaluation processes have kept pace with the evolu- persons, organizations, dates, etc.).",
        "Typically, these tion of QA tasks.",
        "For the past several years, NIST information needs are embedded in the context of a has implemented an evaluation methodology based scenario (i.e., user task) and often require systems to r = # of vital nuggets returned a = # of okay nuggets returned",
        "R = # of vital nuggets in the answer key l = # of non-whitespace characters in entire run synthesize information from multiple documents or to generate answers that cannot be easily extracted (e.g., by leveraging inference capabilities).",
        "To date, NIST has already conducted several large-scale evaluations of complex questions: definition questions in TREC 2003, \"Other\" questions in TREC 2004-2006, \"relationship\" questions in TREC 2005, and the complex, interactive QA (ciQA) task in TREC 2006.",
        "Definition and Other questions are similar in that they both request novel facts about \"targets\", which can be persons, organizations, things, and events.",
        "Relationship questions evolved into the ciQA task and focus on information needs such as \"What financial relationships exist between South American drug cartels and banks in Liechtenstein?\"",
        "Such complex questions focus on ties (financial, military, familial, etc.)",
        "that connect two or more entities.",
        "All of these evaluations have employed the nugget-based methodology, which demonstrates its versatility and applicability to a wide range of information needs.",
        "In the TREC QA evaluations, an answer to a complex question consists of an unordered set of [document-id, answer string] pairs, where the strings are presumed to provide some relevant information that addresses the question.",
        "Although no explicit limit is placed on the length of the answer, the final metric penalizes verbosity (see below).",
        "Evaluation of system output proceeds in two steps.",
        "First, answer strings from all submissions are gathered together and presented to a single assessor.",
        "The source of each answer string is blinded so that the assessor can not obviously tell which systems generated what output.",
        "Using these answers and searches performed during question development, the assessor creates a list of relevant nuggets.",
        "A nugget is a piece of information (i.e., \"fact\") that addresses one aspect of the user's question.",
        "Nuggets should be atomic, in the sense that an assessor should be able to make a binary decision as to whether the nugget appears in an answer string.",
        "Although a nugget represents a conceptual entity, the assessor provides a natural language description – primarily as a memory aid for the subsequent evaluation steps.",
        "These descriptions range from sentence-length document extracts to key phrases to telegraphic shorthand notes – their readability greatly varies from assessor to assessor.",
        "The assessor also manually classifies each nugget as either vital or okay (non-vital).",
        "Vital nuggets represent concepts that must be present in a \"good\" answer.",
        "Okay nuggets may contain interesting information, but are not essential.",
        "In the second step, the same assessor who created the nuggets reads each system's output in turn and marks the appearance of the nuggets.",
        "An answer string contains a nugget if there is a conceptual match; that is, the match is independent of the particular wording used in the system's output.",
        "A nugget match is marked at most once per run – i.e., a system is not rewarded for retrieving a nugget multiple times.",
        "If the system's output contains more than one match for a nugget, the best match is selected and the rest are left unmarked.",
        "A single [document-id, answer string] pair in a system response can match 0, 1, or multiple nuggets.",
        "The final F-score for an answer is calculated in the manner described in Figure 1, and the final score of a run is the average across the F-scores of all questions.",
        "The metric is a weighted harmonic mean between nugget precision and nugget recall, where recall is heavily favored (controlled by the f3 parameter, usually set to three).",
        "Nugget recall is calculated solely on vital nuggets, while nugget precision is approximated by a length allowance based on the number of both vital and okay nuggets returned.",
        "In an earlier pilot study, researchers discovered that it was not possible for assessors to consistently enumerate the total set of nuggets contained in an answer, which corresponds to the denominator in a precision calculation (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "Thus, a penalty for verbosity serves as a surrogate for precision.",
        "The vital/okay distinction has been identified as a weakness in the TREC nugget-based evaluation methodology (Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006).",
        "There do not appear to be any reliable indicators for predicting nugget importance, which makes it challenging to develop algorithms sensitive to this consideration.",
        "Since only vital nuggets affect nugget recall, it is difficult for systems to achieve non-zero scores on topics with few vital nuggets in the answer key.",
        "Thus, scores are easily affected by assessor errors and other random variations in evaluation conditions.",
        "One direct consequence is that in previous TREC evaluations, the median score for many questions turned out to be zero.",
        "A binary distinction on nugget importance is insufficient to discriminate between the quality of runs that return no vital nuggets but different numbers of okay nuggets.",
        "Also, a score distribution heavily skewed towards zero makes meta-analyses of evaluation stability difficult to perform (Voorhees, 2005).",
        "The pyramid extension (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006) was proposed to address the issues mentioned above.",
        "The idea was relatively simple: by soliciting vital/okay judgments from multiple assessors (after the list of nuggets has been produced by a primary assessor), it is possible to define nugget importance with greater granularity.",
        "Each nugget is assigned a weight between zero and one that is proportional to the number of assessors who judged it to be vital.",
        "Nugget recall from Figure 1 can be redefined to incorporate these weights:",
        "Where A is the set of reference nuggets that are matched in a system's output and V is the set of all reference nuggets; wm and wn are the weights of nuggets m and n, respectively.",

        "Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of nugget pyramids, there are a few potential drawbacks that are worth discussing.",
        "One downside is that the nugget pyramid does not represent a single assessor.",
        "The nugget weights reflect the aggregation of opinions across a sample population, but there is no guarantee that the method for computing those weights actually captures any aspect of real user behavior.",
        "It can be argued that the binary F-score is more realistic since it reflects the opinion of a real user (the primary assessor), whereas the pyramid F-score tries to model the opinion of a mythical average user.",
        "Although this point may seem somewhat counterintuitive, it represents a well-established tradition in the information retrieval literature (Voorhees, 2002).",
        "In document retrieval, for example, relevance judgments are provided by a single assessor – even though it is well known that there are large individual differences in notions of relevance.",
        "IR researchers believe that human idiosyncrasies are an inescapable fact present in any system designed for human users, and hence any attempt to remove those elements in the evaluation setup is actually undesirable.",
        "It is the responsibility ofresearchers to develop systems that are robust and flexible.",
        "This premise, however, does not mean that IR evaluation results are unstable or unreliable.",
        "Analyses have shown that despite large variations in human opinions, system rankings are remarkably stable (Voorhees, 2000; Sormunen, 2002) – that is, one can usually be confident about system comparisons.",
        "The philosophy in IR sharply contrasts with work in NLP annotation tasks such as parsing, word sense disambiguation, and semantic role labeling – where researchers strive for high levels of interannota-tor agreement, often through elaborate guidelines.",
        "The difference in philosophies arises because unlike these NLP annotation tasks, where the products are used primarily by other NLP system components, IR (and likewise QA) is an end-user task.",
        "These systems are intended for real world use.",
        "Since people differ, systems must be able to accommodate these differences.",
        "Hence, there is a strong preference in QA for evaluations that maintain a model of the individual user.",
        "The current nugget pyramid method leverages multiple judgments to define a weight for each individual nugget, and then incorporates this weight into the F-score computation.",
        "As an alternative, we propose another method for combining the opinions of multiple assessors: evaluate system responses individually against N sets of binary judgments, and then compute the mean across those scores.",
        "We define the macro-averaged binary F-score over a set A = [a\\,aN} of N assessors as:",
        "^ = YaeA Fa",

        "In tasks where it is important to correctly classify individual instances, micro-averaging is more appropriate.",
        "In tasks where it is important to correctly identify a class, macro-averaging better quantifies performance.",
        "In classification tasks, imbalance in the prevalence of each class can lead to large differences in macro-and micro-averaged scores.",
        "Analogizing to our work, the original formulation of nugget pyramids corresponds to micro-averaging (since we focus on individual nuggets), while the alternative corresponds to macro-averaging (since we focus on the assessor).",
        "We additionally note that the two methods encode different assumptions.",
        "Macro-averaging assumes that there is nothing intrinsically interesting about a nugget – it is simply a matter of a particular user with particular needs finding a particular nugget to be of interest.",
        "Micro-averaging, on the other hand, assumes that some nuggets are inherently interesting, independent of the particular interests of users.",
        "Each approach has characteristics that make it desirable.",
        "From the perspective of evaluators, the macro-averaged binary F-score is preferable because it models real users; each set of binary judgments represents the information need of a real user, each binary F-score represents how well an answer will satisfy a real user, and the macro-averaged binary F-score represents how well an answer will satisfy, on average, a sample population of real users.",
        "From the perspective of QA system developers, the micro-averaged nugget pyramid F-score is preferable because it allows finer discrimination in individual nugget performance, which enables better techniques for system training and optimization.",
        "The macro-averaged binary F-score has the same desirable properties as the micro-averaged pyramid F-score in that fewer responses will have zero F-scores as compared to the single-assessor binary F-score.",

        "The important role that large-scale evaluations play in guiding research in human language technologies means that the community must \"get it right.\"",

        "However, evaluation methodologies must evolve to reflect the shifting interests of the research community to remain relevant.",
        "Thus, organizers of evaluations must walk a fine line between progress and chaos.",
        "Nevertheless, the introduction of nugget pyramids in the TREC QA evaluation provides a case study showing how this fine balance can indeed be achieved.",
        "The addition of multiple judgments of nugget importance yields an evaluation that is both more stable and more discriminative than the original single-assessor evaluation, while requiring only a small additional cost in terms of human labor.",
        "We have explored two different methods for combining judgments from multiple assessors to address shortcomings in the original nugget-based evaluation setup.",
        "Although they make different assumptions about the evaluation, results from both approaches are highly correlated.",
        "Thus, we can continue employing the pyramid-based method, which is well-suited for developing systems, and still be assured that the results remain consistent with an evaluation method that maintains a model of real individual users."
