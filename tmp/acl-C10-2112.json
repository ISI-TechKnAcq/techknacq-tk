        "Transliteration is a process of rewriting a word from a source language to a target language in a different writing system using the word's phonological equivalent.",
        "Many technical terms and proper nouns, such as personal names, names of places and organisations are transliterated during translation of a text from one language to another.",
        "A process reverse to the transliteration, which is recovering a word in its native language from its transliteration in a foreign language, is called backtransliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval, transliteration is an important component.",
        "Name origin refers to the language of origin of a name.",
        "For example, the origin of English name \"Smith\" and its Chinese transliteration \"£ g ÄT (Shi-Mi-Si)\" is English, while both \"Tokyo\" and \"^KïH (Dong-Jing)\" are of Japanese origin.",
        "For machine transliteration the name origins dictate the way we rewrite a foreign name.",
        "For example, given a name written in Chinese for which we do not have a translation in an English-Chinese dictionary, we first have to decide whether the name is of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English or another origin.",
        "Then we follow the transliteration rules implied by the origin of the name.",
        "Although all English personal names are rendered in 26 letters, they may come from different romanization systems.",
        "Each romanisation system has its own rewriting rules.",
        "English name \"Smith\" could be directly transliterated into Chinese as \"^^ÄT (Shi-Mi-Si)\" since it follows the English phonetic rules, while the Chinese translation of Japanese name \"Koizumi\" becomes \"hh jfl (Xiao-Quan)\" following the Japanese phonetic rules.",
        "The name origins are equally important in back-transliteration.",
        "Li et al.",
        "(2007b) demonstrated that incorporating name origin recognition (NOR) into a transliteration system greatly improves the performance of personal name transliteration.",
        "Besides multilingual processing, the name origin also provides useful semantic information (regional and language information) for common NLP tasks, such as co-reference resolution and name entity recognition.",
        "Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to name origin recognition (NOR) so far in the literature.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in recognition of the origins of names written in Chinese, which names can be of three origins: Chinese, Japanese or English, where \"English\" is a rather broad category that includes other West European and American names written natively in Latin script.",
        "Unlike previous work (Qu and Grefenstette, 2004; Li et al., 2007a; Li et al., 2007b), where NOR was formulated with a generative model, we follow the approach of Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) and regard the NOR task as a classification problem, using a discriminative learning algorithm for classification.",
        "Furthermore, in the training data with names labelled with their origin is rather limited, whereas there is vast data from news articles that contains many personal names without any labels of their origins.",
        "In this research we propose a method to harness the power of the unlabelled noisy news data by bootstrapping the learning process with labelled data and then using the personal name context in the unlabelled data to improve the NOR model.",
        "We achieve that by using the maximum entropy model and the expectation-maximisation training, and demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the accuracy of NOR compared to the baseline model trained only from the labelled data.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we review the previous research.",
        "In Section 3 we present our approach, and in Section 4 we describe our experimental setup, the data used and the evaluation method.",

        "Most the research up to date focuses primarily on recognition of origin of names written in Latin script, called English NOR (ENOR), although the same methods can be extended to names in Chinese script (CNOR).",
        "We notice that there are two informative clues that used in previous work in ENOR.",
        "One is the lexical structure of a romanisation system, for example, Hanyu Pinyin, Mandarin Wade-Giles, Japanese Hepbrun or Korean Yale, each has a finite set of syllable inventory (Li et al., 2007a).",
        "Another is the phonetic and phono-tactic structure of a language, such as phonetic composition, syllable structure.",
        "For example, English has unique consonant clusters such as \"str\" and \"ks\" which Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) do not have.",
        "Considering the NOR solutions by the use of these two clues, we can roughly group them into two categories: rule-based methods (for solutions based on lexical structures) and statistical methods (for solutions based on phonotac-tic structures).",
        "Rule-based method Kuo et al.",
        "(2007) proposed using a rule-based method to recognise different romanisation system for Chinese only.",
        "The left-to-right longest match-based lexical segmentation was used to parse a test word.",
        "The romanisation system is confirmed if it gives rise to a successful parse of the test word.",
        "This kind of approach (Qu and Grefen-stette, 2004) is suitable for romanisation systems that have a finite set of discriminative syllable inventory, such as Pinyin for Chinese Mandarin.",
        "For the general tasks of identifying the language origin and romanisation system, rule based approach sounds less attractive because not all languages have a finite set of discriminative syllable inventory.",
        "N-gram statistics methods",
        "N-gram sum method Qu and Grefenstette (2004) proposed a NOR identifier using a trigram language model (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994) to distinguish personal names of three language origins, namely Chinese, Japanese and English.",
        "In their work the training set includes 11,416 Chinese, 83,295 Japanese and 88,000 English name entries.",
        "However, the trigram is defined as the joint probability p(ciCi_1Ci_2) rather than the commonly used conditional probability p(d\\ci_1Ci_2).",
        "Therefore it is basically a substring unigram probability.",
        "For origin recognition of Japanese names, this method works well with an accuracy of 92%.",
        "However, for English and Chinese, the results are far behind with a reported accuracy of 87% and 70% respectively.",
        "N-gram perplexity method Li et al.",
        "(2007a) proposed a method of NOR using n-gram character perplexity PPc to identify the origin of names written in Latin script.",
        "Using bigrams, the perplexity is defined as where Nc is the total number of characters in a given name, a is the i-th character in the name and p(ci\\ci_1 ) is the bigram probability learned from a list of names of the same origin.",
        "Therefore, PPc can be used to measure how well a new name fits the model learned from the training set of names.",
        "The origin is assigned according to the model that gives the lowest perplexity value.",
        "Li et al.",
        "(2007a) demonstrated that using PPc gives much better performance than with the substring unigram method.",
        "Classification method Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) proposed using a discriminative classification approach and extract features from the names.",
        "They use Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model and a number of features based on n-grams, character positions, word length as well as some rule-based phonetic features.",
        "They performed both ENOR and CNOR and demonstrated that their method indeed leads to better performance in name origin recognition then the n-gram statistics method.",
        "They attribute that to the fact their model incorporates more robust features than the n-gram statistics based models.",
        "In this paper we too follow the discriminating classification approach, but we add features based on the context of a personal name.",
        "These features require the original text with the names to be available.",
        "Our approach closely models the real-life situation when large corpora of articles with personal names is readily available in the Web, yet the origins of the names are unknown."

        "The principle of maximum entropy is that given a collection of facts we should choose a model that is consistent with all the facts but otherwise as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) is known to easily combine diverse features and has been used widely in natural language processing research.",
        "Given an observation x the probability of outcome label ci, i = 1... N given x is given by where N is the number of the outcome labels, which is the number of name origins in our case, n is the number of features, fj are the feature functions and Aj are the model parameters.",
        "Each parameter corresponds to exactly one feature and can be viewed as a \"weight\" for the corresponding feature.",
        "Z is the normalisation factor given by",
        "In the problem at hand x is a personal name and all the features are binary.",
        "The features, also known as contextual predicates, are in the form where cp is the contextual predicate that maps a pair (ci, x) to {true, false}.",
        "In our experiments we use Zhang's maximum entropy library.",
        "For the initial training of MaxEnt model we use labelled data: personal names of Chinese, Japanese or English origin written in Chinese.",
        "The origin of each name is known.",
        "Following paper by Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) and their findings regarding the contribution value of each feature that they studied, we extract unigram, positional unigram and word length features.",
        "For example, Chinese name \"UMS\" has the following features:",
        "We restrict the n-gram features to unigram only to avoid the data sparseness, because our data contains a number of Chinese surnames and given names, which have a length of one or two characters.",
        "For further training of MaxEnt model we use unlabelled data collected from news articles.",
        "The name origin is not known but each personal name is in a context and is often surrounded by names of places that may give a hint about the personal name origin.",
        "For each personal name we extract all names of places in the same paragraph and use them as features.",
        "If a place name is repeated many times in the same paragraph we only include it once in the feature list.",
        "For example, paragraph containing passage \"The U.S. President Barack Obama ...\" will result in two personal names \"Barack\" and \"Obama\" having \"U.S.\" as their context feature.",
        "Due to the diversity of place names we also attempt to map the names of the places into the country names.",
        "In this case, features like \"U.S.\", \"USA\", \"America\" are manually substituted with \"USA\".",
        "In our experiments we also try to narrow the place name extraction to windows of different sizes surrounding the personal name.",
        "The rationale here is that the closer a place name is to the personal name, the more likely it has a connection to the origin of the personal name.",
        "In summary, our algorithm includes two steps.",
        "First, we use the boostrap data and n-gram, positional n-gram and name length features to do the initial training (the 0-th iteration) of MaxEnt model with L-BFGS method (Byrd et al., 1995).",
        "After that we use the model to assign origin labels to names of the training set of the unlabelled data.",
        "Next, we use both the bootstrap data and the training set of the unlabelled data, labelled in the previous step, and add the context features to the already used n-gram, positional n-gram and name length features.",
        "Since there is no context available for the bootstrap data, the context features for it are missing, which can be handled by the MaxEnt model.",
        "We perform the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) iterations by using the mixed data to train the i-th iteration of the MaxEnt model, then use the model to relabel the training set of the unlabelled data and repeat the training of the model for the (i + 1)-st iteration.",
        "We stop the iterations when the ratio of patterns that change the origin labels becomes less than 0.01%."
