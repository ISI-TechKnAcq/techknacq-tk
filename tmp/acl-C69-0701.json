        "dith increased application of computers in the processing of natural languages comes the need for correcting errors introduced by human operators at the input stage.",
        "A statistic investigation [1] revealed that roughly 80 per cent of all misspelled words contain only one error, belonging to one of the following cases: a letter missing, an extra letter, a wrong letter and finally two adjacent letters interchanged.",
        "As such an error can occur in any position, a check by trying all possible alternatives in turn is clearly impracticable.",
        "A method which can obtain the same result but in a less tedious and time-consuming way has been worked out and experimented upon at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, England.",
        "This method, named'elastic matching' was first proposed at the 1968 I.F.I.P.",
        "Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland [2].",
        "The elastic matching of words consists basically of coding all the characters (letters) as bits in a computer word, allotting to each letter a specific position.",
        "The whole English alphabet will therefore be represented by a sequence of 26 bits, although their order, as will be shown below, may, and indeed should, differ from the usual order of letters in the alphabet.",
        "- 2 - All words belonging to a complete set, which may be a list of words or a whole dictionary, are 'linearized', that is converted into segments, called 'lines', in which the letters are arranged in the agreed order.",
        "if the current letter has a position prior to the last stored, a new line must be started.",
        "Thus, if the sequence in question were the alphabet itself, the word 'interest' (for example) would be linearized as follows: 'int-er-est'.",
        "The actual sequence, by the way, has to be chosen in such a way that it would produce the longest possible lines or, in other words, the minimum number of lines for a given sample of text.",
        "The matching is carried out not between words but between lines.",
        "All errors will then stand out immediately as one or more disagreeing bits*.",
        "In the case of two bits a simple check will reveal whether this is the result of an accepted type of error (one wrong letter, or two adjacent letters interchanged), or the result of two separate errors, and therefore to be rejected under the limit accepted (one error per word).",
        "In the examples shown below the alphabet has been assumed to be the linearizing sequence; this is done for the sake of better clarity only.",
        "The result (d) is unacceptable because the two disagreeing bits * For example by using the logical 'NOT-EQUIVALENT' operation.",
        "- 3 - are formed as a result of two errors (extra S and missing E).",
        "In the computer check this is shown by the two outstanding bits (letters) being separated by another bit (letter).",
        "If the numbers of lines in the two versions (misspelled and correct) are unequal, the procedure is as follows.",
        "The next line of the longer version is shifted back and matched against the result (that is, the disagreeing bits) of the previous match.",
        "Thus, for example,",
        "In the case of two disagreeing bits some simple checks have again to be made to eliminate the two-error cases, and also to prevent spurious matches resulting from the self-cancellation of characters between the two successive lines of the same version.",
        "More particulars of the operation of this method can be found in a special paper [5]."

        "It is, however, the application to natural languages, in particular English, which is the subject of this paper.",
        "There are two problems which have to be overcome or, at least, reduced to manageable proportions before this method can be applied using a complete English dictionary.",
        "The first problem is access to the dictionary which may contain tens or even hundreds of thousands of entries.",
        "This number, however, includes all grammatical forms of English words (fortunately, they are not so numerous as in highly inflected languages such as Russian).",
        "The dictionary lookup takes different forms depending on the -4-way in which the dictionary is organized.",
        "The latter could have either a treelike structure (preferably built of 'lines') which is likely to be quicker in operation, or a list structure, in which words may be grouped by their line numbers, then by numbers of letters and finally, if the lists are still too long, by part-alphabetization (according to the accepted sequence).",
        "This structure is easier to prepare.",
        "The words to be checked against the dictionary of the list structure will be linearized, and during this process the numbers of their lines and letters will be determined.",
        "The sections of the dictionary to be used in the matching process will be those with equal numbers of lines (and letters) and those immediately below and above these numbers (depending on the error threshold accepted).",
        "The other problem is connected with the number of multiple matches likely to occur, especially for short words.",
        "Two ways of alleviating this problem are described in the next section."

        "The size of the sample processed for the general-content check must not be too small or too large.",
        "The optimum size should be determined experimentally, but one may risk the guess that perhaps 1-2 thousand (current) test words are a practical amount.",
        "Further, there is no need to store all the different words.",

        "The selection can easily be done in the storing process if dictionary entries are suitably marked.",

        "Since the latter part of the operation is naturally much slower (about four times that of the recording), a project, now in progress at the NPL, aims at securing automatic transcription, in which the character levers, in addition to the ordinary printing action, activate electric contacts.",
        "These create impulses, which are fed into a computer and result, after a series of operations, in printing out a text as near to ordinary English, as possible.",
        "One of the problems encountered in this process is caused by the flexibility of the recording convention, enabling the human operator to record phonetic combinations in more than one way.",
        "Generally, this is provided for by inserting in the automatic Palantype-English dictionary all versions of each word that can be reasonably foreseen.",
        "In practice the unforeseen sometimes happens and the word is output untranslated (but 'transliterated' phonetically), which is at the best annoying, but may even be unreadable.",
        "An analysis has shown that most of the deviations from standard versions stored in the dictionary are caused by a few convention rules, such as e.g. 'vowel elision': any unaccented vowel in a word can be omitted.",
        "Now, if the matching is done not on Palantype strokes but on their linearized versions, the elastic matching rules can easily be adjusted to include the versions produced.",
        "Incidentally, the Palantype sequence is already partly linearized, and reads: SCPTH + MERNLYOCAUI .",
        "NLCMFRPT + SH (the \"+\" and \".\" signs have special phonetic functions).",
        "For the linearization purposes all that is needed is to exclude the repeated consonants (from second \"N\" to the end); the number of lines will therefore exceed the number of 'strokes'.",
        "The relevant procedures have been fully tested on sample lists of standard and non-standard versions (containing up to 300 words) and were found satisfactory.",
        "The implementation, however, for use with the full dictionary remains to be done.",
        "It is still not clear whether it would repay to linearize and store in this form the complete dictionary of eighty odd thousand entries; or whether it would be more practical to linearize while checking, stroke by stroke, which would be, of course, a much slower procedure.",
        "At the present time it does not look likely that either solution would lead to standardization being possible in 'real,-time', but there remains the possibility of an 'errata' sheet being produced almost immediately after the normal output.",
