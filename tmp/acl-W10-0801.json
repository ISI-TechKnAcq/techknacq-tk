        "In Construction Grammar, structurally patterned units called constructions are assigned meaning in the same way that words are - via convention rather than composition.",
        "That is, rather than piecing semantics together from individual lexical items, Construction Grammar proposes that semantics can be assigned at the construction level.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether a classifier can be taught to identify these constructions and consider the hypothesis that identifying construction types can improve the semantic interpretation of previously unseen predicate uses.",
        "Our results show that not only can the constructions be automatically identified with high accuracy, but the classifier also performs just as well with out-of-vocabulary predicates."

        "The root of many challenges in natural language processing applications is the fact that humans can convey a single piece of information in numerous and creative ways.",
        "Syntactic variations (e.g.",
        "I gave him my book.",
        "vs.",
        "I gave my book to him.",
        "), the use of synonyms (e.g. She bought a used car.",
        "vs. She purchased a pre-owned automobile.)",
        "and numerous other variations can complicate the semantic analysis and the automatic understanding of a text.",
        "Consider the following sentence.",
        "(1) They hissed him out of the university",
        "While (1) is clearly understandable for humans, to automatically discern the meaning of hissed in this instance would take more than learning that the verb hiss is defined as \"make a sharp hissing sound\" (WordNet 3.0).",
        "Knowing that hiss can also mean \"a show of contempt\" is helpful.",
        "However, it would also require the understanding that the sentence describes a causative event if we are to interpret this sentence as meaning something like \"They caused him to leave the university by means of hissing or contempt\".",
        "The problem of novel words, expressions and usages are especially significant because discriminative learning methods used for automatic text classification do not perform as well when tested on text with a feature distribution that is different from what was seen in the training data.",
        "This is recognized to be a critical issue in domain adaptation (Ben-David et.",
        "al, 2006).",
        "Whether we seek to account for words or usages that are infrequent in the training data or to adapt a trained classifier to a new domain of text that includes new vocabulary or new forms of expressions, success in overcoming these challenges partly lies in the successful identification and the use of features that generalize over linguistic variation.",
        "In this paper we borrow from the theories presented by Construction Grammar (CxG) to explore the development of general features that may help account for the linguistic variability and creativity we see in the data.",
        "Specifically, we investigate whether a classifier can be taught to identify constructions as described by CxG and gauge their value in interpreting novel words.",
        "The development of approaches to effectively capture such novel semantics will enhance applications requiring richer representations of language understanding such as machine translation, information retrieval, and text summarization.",
        "Consider, for instance, the following machine translation into Spanish by the Google translate (http://translate.google.com/):",
        "They hissed him out of the university.",
        "Silbaban fuera de la universidad.",
        "Tr.",
        "They were whistling outside the university.",
        "The translation has absolutely no implication that a group of people did something to cause another person to leave the university.",
        "However, when the verb is changed to a verb that is seen to frequently appear in a caused motion interpretation (e.g. throw), the results are correct:",
        "They threw him out of the university.",
        "- Lo sacaron de la universidad.",
        "Tr.",
        "They took him out of the university.",
        "Thus, if we could facilitate a caused motion interpretation by bootstrapping semantics from caused motion), we could enable accurate translations that otherwise would not be possible."

        "In natural language processing (NLP), the issue of semantic analysis in the presence of lexical and syntactic variability is often perceived as the purview of either word sense disambiguation (WSD) or semantic role labeling (SRL) or both.",
        "In the case of WSD, the above issue is often tackled through the use of large corpora tagged with sense information to train a classifier to recognize the different shades of meaning of a semantically ambiguous word (Ng and Lee, 2006; Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).",
        "In the case of SRL, the goal is to identify each of the arguments of the predicate and label them according to their semantic relationship to the predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "There are several corpora available for training WSD classifiers such as WordNet's SemCor (Miller 1995; Fellbaum 1998) and the GALE OntoNotes data (Hovy et.",
        "al., 2006).",
        "However, most, if not all, of these corpora include only a small fraction of all English predicates.",
        "Since WSD systems train separate classifiers for each predicate, if a particular predicate does not exist in the sparse training data, a system cannot create an accurate semantic interpretation.",
        "Even if the predicate is present, the appropriate sense might not be.",
        "In such a case, the WSD will again be unable to contribute to a correct overall semantic interpretation.",
        "This is the case in example (1), where even the extremely fine-grained sense distinctions provided by WordNet do not include a sense of hiss that is consistent with the caused motion interpretation rendered in the example.",
        "Available for SRL tasks are efforts such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) that have developed semantic role labels (based on differing approaches) and have labeled large corpora for training and testing of SRL systems.",
        "PropBank (PB) identifies and labels the semantic arguments of the verb on a verb-by-verb basis, creating a separate frameset that includes verb specific semantic roles to account for each subcategorization frame of the verb.",
        "Much like PB, FrameNet (FN) identifies and labels semantic roles, known as Frame Elements, around a relational target, usually a verb.",
        "But unlike PB, Frame Elements less verb specific, but rather are defined in terms of semantic structures called frames evoked by the verb.",
        "That is, one or more verbs can be associated with a single semantic frame.",
        "Currently FN has over 2000 distinct Frame Elements.",
        "The lexical resource VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) details semantic classes of verbs, where a class is composed of verbs that have similar syntactic realizations, following work by Levin (1993).",
        "Verbs are grouped by their syntactic realization or frames, and each frame is associated with a meaning.",
        "For example, the verbs loan and rent are grouped together in class 13.1 with roughly a \"give\" meaning, and the verbs deposit and situate are grouped into 9.1 with roughly a \"put\" meaning.",
        "Although differing in the nature of their tasks, WSD and SRL systems both treat lexical items as the source of meaning in a clause.",
        "In WSD, for every sense we need a new entry in our dictionary to be able to interpret the sentence.",
        "With SRL, we",
        "PropBank labels Arg0 and Arg1, for the most part, correspond to Dowty's Prototypical Agent and Prototypical Patient, respectively, providing important generalizations.",
        "need the semantic role labels that describe the predicate argument relationships in order to extract the meaning.",
        "In either case, we are still left with the same issue - if the meaning lies in the lexical items, how do we interpret unseen words and novel lexical usages?",
        "As shown in the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), system performance numbers drop significantly when a classifier, trained on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, is tested on the Brown corpus.",
        "This is largely due to the \"highly ambiguous and unseen predicates (i.e. predicates that do not have training examples)\" (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006)."

        "This issue of scalability and generalizability across genres could possibly be improved by linking semantics more directly with syntax, as theorized by Construction Grammar (CxG) (Fillmore et.",
        "al., 1988; Golderg, 1995; Kay, 2002; Michaelis, 2004; Goldberg, 2006).",
        "This theory suggests that the meaning of a sentence arises not only from the lexical items but also from the patterned structures or constructions they sit in.",
        "The meaning of a given phrase, a sentence, or an utterance, then, arises from the combination of lexical items and the syntactic structure in which they are found, including any patterned structural configurations (e.g. patterns of idiomatic expressions such as \"The Xer, the Yer\" - The bigger, the better) or recurring structural elements (e.g. function words such as determiners, particles, conjunctions, and prepositions).",
        "That is, instead of focusing solely on the semantic label of words, as is done in SRL and in many traditional theories in Linguistics, CxG brings more into focus the interplay of lexical items and syntactic forms or structural patterns as the source of meaning.",
        "Thus, rather than just assigning labels at the level of lexical items and predicate arguments as a way of piecing together the meaning of a sentence, we follow the central premise of CxG.",
        "Specifically, that semantics can be and should be interpreted at the level of the larger structural configuration.",
        "Consider the following three sentences, each having the same syntactic structure, each taken from different genres of writing available on the web.",
        "Blogger arrested - blog him out of jail!",
        "[Blog] Someone mind controlled me off the cliff.",
        "[Gaming] He clocked the first pitch into center field.",
        "[Baseball]",
        "Each of these sentences makes use of words, especially the verb, in ways particular to their genre.",
        "Even if we are unfamiliar with the specific jargon used, as a human we can infer the general meaning intended by each of the three sentences: a person X causes an entity Y to move in the path specified by the prepositional phrase (e.g. third sentence: \"A player causes something to land in the center field.",
        "\").",
        "In a similar way, if we can assign a meaning of caused motion at the sentence level and an automatic learner can be trained to accurately identify the construction, then even when presented with an unseen word, a useful semantic analysis is still possible.",
        "For this effort, we focused on the caused-motion construction, which can be defined as having the coarse-grained syntactic structure of Subject Noun Phrase followed by a verb that takes both a Noun Phrase Object and a Prepositional Phrase: (NP-SBJ (V NP PP)); and the semantic meaning 'the agent, NP-SBJ, directly causes the patient, NP, to move along the path specified by the PP' (Goldberg 1995).",
        "This construction is exemplified by the following sentences from (Goldberg 1995):",
        "(2) Frank sneezed the tissue off the table.",
        "(3) Mary urged Bill into the house.",
        "(4) Fred stuffed the papers in the envelope.",
        "(5) Sally threw a ball to him.",
        "However, not all syntactic structures of the form (NP-SBJ (V NP PP)) belong to the caused-motion construction.",
        "Consider the following sentences.",
        "(6) I considered Ben as one of my brothers.",
        "(7) Jen took the highway into Pennsylvania.",
        "(8) We saw the bird in the shopping mall.",
        "(9) Mary kicked the ball to my relief.",
        "however, the PP indicates the location in which the \"seeing\" event happened, not a path along which \"we\" caused \"the bird\" to move.",
        "Though the PP in (7) expresses a path, it is not a path in which Jen causes \"the highway\" to move.",
        "As an initial step in determining the usefulness of construction grammar for interpreting semantics in computational linguistics, we present the results of our study aimed at ascertaining if a classifier can be taught to identify caused-motion constructions.",
        "We also report on our investigations into which features were most useful in the classification of caused-motion constructions."

        "From this corpus, all sentences with the syntactic form (NP-SBJ (V NP PP)) were selected.",
        "The selection allowed for intervening adverbial phrases (e.g. \"Sally threw a ball quickly to him\") and additional prepositional phrases (e.g. \"Sally threw a ball to him on Tuesday\" or \"Sally threw a ball in anger into the scorer's table\").",
        "A total of 14.7k instances were identified in this manner.",
        "To reduce the size of the corpus to be labeled to a target of 1800 instances, we removed, firstly, instances containing traces as parsed by the TreeBank.",
        "These included passive usages (e.g. \"Coffee was shipped from Colombia by Gracie\") and instances with traces in the object NP or PP including questions and relative clauses (e.g. \"What did Gracie ship from Colombia?\").",
        "In construction grammar, however, traces do not exist, since grammar is a set of patterns of varying degrees of complexity.",
        "Thus CxG would characterize passives, questions structures, and relative clauses as having their own respective phrasal constructions, which combine with the caused-motion construction.",
        "In order to ensure sufficient training data with the standard form of the caused-motion construction as defined in Goldberg 1995 and 2006 (see Section 3.2), we chose to remove these usages.",
        "Secondly, we removed the instances of sentences that can be deterministically categorized as non-caused motion constructions: instances containing ADV, EXT, PRD, VOC, or TMP type object NPs (e.g. \"Cindy drove five hours from Dallas\", \"You listen, boy, to what I say!\").",
        "Because we can automatically identify this category, keeping these examples in our data would have resulted in even higher performance.",
        "We also considered the possibility of reducing the size by removing certain classes of verbs such as verbs of communication (e.g. reply, bark), psychological state (e.g. amuse, admire), or existence (e.g. be, exist).",
        "While it is reasonable to say that these verb types are highly unlikely to appear in a caused-motion construction, if we were to remove sets of verbs based on their likely behavior, we would also be excluding interesting usages such as \"The stand-up comedian amused me into a state of total enjoyment. \"",
        "or \"The leader barked a command into a radio.\"",

        "of caused-motion.",

        "The distribution in the training set is 31.8% CM and 68.2% NON-CM.",
        "For our experiments, we used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel.",
        "In particular we made use of the LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) as training and testing software.",
        "The baseline consisted of a single conceptual feature - the lemmatized, case-normalized verb.",
        "We chose the verb as a baseline feature because it is generally accepted to be the core lexical item in a sentence, which governs the syntactic structure and semantic constituents around it.",
        "This is especially evidenced in the Penn Treebank where NP nodes are assigned with syntactic labels according to the position in the tree relative to the verb (e.g. Subject).",
        "In VerbNet and PropBank, the semantic labels are assigned to the constituents around the verb, each according to its semantic relationship with the verb.",
        "This verb feature was encoded as 478 binary features (one for each unique verb in the dataset), where the feature value corresponding to the instance's verb was 1 and all others were 0.",

        "Future work will evaluate the effect of automatically extracting these features.",

        "Furthermore, unlike the semantics of features that are dependent on content words that are subject to lexical variability, prepositions are limited in their lexical variability, which make them good general features that scale well across different semantic domains.",
        "In addition to the preposition feature, the verb feature was found to affect performance at a statistically significant level in both cases.",
        "Based on the numerous studies in the past that have shown the usefulness of the verb as a feature, this is not an unexpected result.",
        "Interestingly, our results seem to indicate interactions between features.",
        "This can be seen in two different instances.",
        "First, while feature 8 (NEs for Object NP) alone was not found to be a predictive feature, when removed, it resulted in a statistically significant drop in performance compared to that of the full feature set.",
        "The opposite effect can be seen with the VerbNet Classes feature.",
        "While it showed a statistically significant boost in performance when introduced into the system by itself, when dropped from the full feature set, the drop in the system performance was not found to be significant.",
        "This seems to indicate that NEs for Object NP and the VerbNet Classes features have strong interactions with one or more of the other features.",
