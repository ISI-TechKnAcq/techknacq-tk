        "Topic models (Blei et al., 2010) have proved to be useful for interpreting and organising the contents of large document collections.",
        "It seems intuitively plausible that some automatically generated topics will be similar while others are dis-similar.",
        "For ex-ample, a topic about basketball (team game james season player nba play knicks coach league) is more similar to a topic about football (world cup team soccer africa player south game match goal) than one about the global finance (fed financial banks federal reserve bank bernanke rule crisis credit).",
        "Methods for automatically determining the similarity between topics have several potential applications, such as analysis of corpora to determine topics being discussed (Hall et al., 2008) or within topic browsers to decide which topics should be shown together (Chaney and Blei, 2012; Gretarsson et al., 2012; Hinneburg et al., 2012).",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is a popular type of topic model but cannot capture such correlations unless the semantic similarity between topics is measured.",
        "Other topic models, such as the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), overcome this limitation and identify correlations between topics.",
        "Approaches to identifying similar topics for a range of tasks have been described in the literature but they have been restricted to using information from the word probability distribution to compare topics and have not been directly evaluated.",
        "Word distributions have been compared using a variety of measures such as KL-divergence (Li and McCallum, 2006; Wang et al., 2009; Newman et al., 2009), cosine measure (He et al., 2009; Ram-age et al., 2009) and the average Log Odds Ratio (Chaney and Blei, 2012).",
        "Kim and Oh (2011) also applied the cosine measure and KL-Divergence which were compared with four other measures: Jaccard's Coefficient, Kendall's ?",
        "coefficient, Discount Cumulative Gain and Jensen Shannon Divergence (JSD).",
        "This paper compares a wider range of approaches to measuring topic similarity than previous work.",
        "In addition these measures are evaluated directly by comparing them against human judgements.",
        "2 Measuring Topic Similarity We compare measures based on word probability distributions (Section 2.1), distributional semantic methods (Sections 2.2-2.4), knowledge-based approaches (Section 2.5) and their combination (Sec- tion 2.6).",
        "2.1 Topic Word Probability Distribution We first experimented with measures based on comparison of the topics?",
        "word distributions (see Section 1), by applying the JSD, KL-divergence and Cosine approaches and the Log Odds Ratio (Chaney and Blei, 2012).",
        "22 2.2 Topic Model Semantic Space The semantic space generated by the topic model can be used to represent the topics and the topic words.",
        "By definition each topic is a probability distribution over the words in the training corpus.",
        "For a corpus with D documents and V words, a topic model learns a relation between words and topics, T , as a T ?V matrix,W, that indicates the probability of each word in each topic.",
        "W is the topic model semantic space and each topic word can be represented as a vector, V i , with topics as features weighted by the probability of the word in each topic.",
        "The similarity between two topics is computed as the average pairwise cosine similarity between their top-10 most probable words (TS-Cos).",
        "2.3 Reference Corpus Semantic Space Topic words can also be represented as vectors in a semantic space constructed from an external source.",
        "We adapt the method proposed by Aletras and Stevenson (2013) for measuring topic coherence using distributional semantics 1 .",
        "Top-N Features A semantic space is constructed considering only the top n most frequent words in Wikipedia (excluding stop words) as context features.",
        "Each topic word is represented as a vector of n features weighted by computing the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1989) between the topic word and each context feature, PMI(w i , w j ) ?",

        "= 3 and found that the best performance is obtained for n = 5000.",
        "Similarity between two topics is defined as the average cosine similarity of the topic word vectors (RCS-Cos-N).",
        "Topic Word Space Alternatively, we consider only the top-10 topic words from the two topics as context features to generate topic word vectors.",
        "Then, topic similarity is computed as the pairwise cosine similarity of the topic word vectors (RCS- Cos-TWS).",
        "Word Association Topic similarity can also be computed by applying word association measures directly.",
        "Newman et al. (2010) measure topic coherence as the average PMI between the topic words.",
        "This approach can be adapted to measure 1 Wikipedia is used as a reference corpus to count word co-occurrences and frequencies using a context window of ?10 words centred on a topic word.",
        "topic similarity by computing the average pairwise PMI between the topic words in two topics (PMI).",
        "2.4 Training Corpus Semantic Space Term-Document Space A matrixX can be created using the training corpus.",
        "Each term (row) represents a topic word vector.",
        "Element x ij in X is the tf.idf of the term i in document j.",
        "Topic similarity is computed as the pairwise cosine similarity of the topic word vectors (TCS-Cos-TD).",
        "Word Co-occurrence in Training Documents Alternatively, we generate a matrix Z of co-document frequencies.",
        "The matrix Z consists of V rows and columns representing the V vocabulary words.",
        "Element z ij is the log of the number of documents that contains the words i and j normalised by the document frequency, DF, of the word j. Mimno et al. (2011) introduced that metric to measure topic coherence.",
        "We adapted it to estimate topic similarity by aggregating the co-document frequency of the words between two topics (Doc-Co-occ).",
        "2.5 Knowledge-based Methods UKB (Agirre et al., 2009) is used to generate a probability distribution over WordNet synsets for each word in the vocabulary V of the topic model using the Personalized PageRank algorithm.",
        "The similarity between two topic words is calculated by transforming these distributions into vectors and computing the cosine metric.",
        "The similarity between two topics is computed by measuring pairwise similarity between their top-10 topic words and selecting the highest score.",
        "Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) proposed by Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) transforms the topic keywords into vectors that consist of Wikipedia article titles weighted by their relevance to the keyword.",
        "For each topic, the centroid is computed from the keyword vectors.",
        "Similarity between topics is computed as the cosine similarity of the ESA centroid vectors.",
        "2.6 Feature Combination Using SVR We also evaluate the performance of a support vector regression system (SVR) (Vapnik, 1998) with a linear kernel using a combination of approaches described above as features 2 .",
        "The system is trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation.",
        "2 With the exception of JSD, features based on the topics?",
        "word probability distributions were not used by SVR since it was found that including them reduced performance.",
        "23 3 Evaluation Data We created a data set consisting of pairs of topics generated by two topic models (LDA and CTM) over two document collections using different numbers of topics.",
        "The first consists of 47,229 news articles from New York Times (NYT) in the GigaWord corpus and the second contains 50,000 articles from ukWAC (Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "Each article is tokenised then stop words and words appearing fewer than five times in the corpora removed.",
        "This results in a total of 57,651 unique tokens for the NYT corpus and 72,672 for ukWAC.",
        "LDA Topics are learned by training LDA models over the two corpora using gensim 3 .",
        "The number of topics is set to T = 50, 100, 200 and hy-perparameters, ?",
        "and ?, are set to 1 T .",
        "Randomly selecting pairs of topics will result to a data set in which the majority of pairs would not be similar.",
        "We overcome that problem by assuming that the JSD between likely relevant pairs will be low while it will be higher for less relevant pairs of topics.",
        "We selected 800 pairs of topics.",
        "600 pairs represent topics with similar word distributions (in the top 6 most relevant topics ranked by JSD).",
        "The remaining 200 pairs were selected randomly.",
        "CTM is trained using the EM algorithm 4 .",
        "The number of topics to learn is set to T = 50, 100, 200 and the rest of the settings are set to their default values.",
        "The topic graph generated by CTM was used to create all the possible pairs between topics that are connected.",
        "This results in a total of 70, 468 and 695 pairs in NYT, and a total of 80, 246 and 258 pairs in ukWAC for the 50, 100 and 200 topics respectively.",
        "Incoherent topics are removed using an approach based on distributional semantics (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013).",
        "Each topic is represented using the top 10 words with the highest marginal probability.",
        "Human Judgements of Topic Similarity were obtained using an online crowdsourcing platform, Crowdflower.",
        "Annotators were provided with pairs of topics and were asked to judge how similar the topics are by providing a rating on a scale of 0 (completely unrelated) to 5 (identical).",
        "The average response for each pair was calculated in order to create the final similarity judgement for use as a gold-standard.",
        "The average Inter-Annotator 3 http://radimrehurek.com/gensim 4 http://www.cs.princeton.edu/ ?",
        "blei/ ctm-c/index.html agreement (IAA) across all pairs for all of the collections is in the range of 0.53-0.68.",
        "The data set together with gold-standard annotations is freely available 5 .",
        "4 Results Table 1 shows the correlation (Spearman) between the topic similarity metrics described in Section 2 and average human judgements for the LDA and CTM topic pairs.",
        "It also shows the performance of a Word Overlap baseline which measures the number of terms that two topics have in common normalised by the total number of topic terms.",
        "The correlations obtained using the topics?",
        "word probability distributions (Section 2.1), i.e. JSD, KL-divergence and Cos, are comparable with the baseline for all of the topic collections and topic models.",
        "The metric proposed by Chaney and Blei (2012) also compares probability distributions and fails to perform well on either data set.",
        "These results suggest that these metrics may be sensitive to the high dimensionality of the vocabulary.",
        "They also assign high similarity to topics that contain ambiguous words, resulting in low correlations with human judgements.",
        "Performance of the cosine of the word vector (TS-Cos) in the Topic Model Semantic Space (Section 2.2) varies implying that the quality of the latent space generated by LDA and CTM is sensitive to the number of topics.",
        "The similarity metrics that use the reference corpus (Section 2.3) consistently produce good correlations for topic pairs generated using both LDA and CTM.",
        "The best overall correlation for a single feature in most cases is obtained using average PMI (in a range of 0.43-0.74).",
        "The performance of the distributional semantic metric using the Topic Word Space (RCS-Cos-TWS) is comparable and slightly lower for the top-N features (RCS-Cos-N).",
        "This indicates that the reference corpus covers a broader range of semantic subjects than the latent space produced by the topic model.",
        "When the term-document matrix from the training corpus is used as a vector space (Section 2.4) performance is worse than when the reference corpus is used.",
        "In addition, using co-document frequency derived from the training corpus does not correlate particularly well with human judgements.",
        "These methods are sensitive to the size of the corpus, which may be too small to gener-5 http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ people/N.Aletras/resources/topicSim.",
