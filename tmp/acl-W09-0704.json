        "Recent research into the nature of morphology has demonstrated the feasibility of several approaches to the definition of a language's inflectional system.",
        "Central to these approaches is the notion of an inflectional paradigm.",
        "In general terms, the inflectional paradigm of a lexeme L can be regarded as a set of cells, where each cell is the pairing of L with a set of morphosyntactic properties, and each cell has a word form as its realization; for instance, the paradigm of the lexeme walk includes cells such as <walk, {3rd singular present indicative}> and <walk, {past}>, whose realizations are the word forms walks and walked.",
        "Given this notion, one approach to the definition of a language's inflectional system is the realiza-tional approach (Matthews 1972, Zwicky 1985,",
        "Anderson 1992, Corbett & Fraser 1993, Stump 2001); in this approach, each word form in a lexeme's paradigm is deduced from the lexical and morphosyntactic properties of the cell that it realizes by means of a system of morphological rules.",
        "For instance, the word form walks is deduced from the cell <walk, {3rd singular present indicative} > by means of the rule of s suffixation, which applies to the root walk of the lexeme walk to express the property set {3rd singular present indicative} .",
        "we apply the realizational approach to the study of Yoruba verbs.",
        "Yoruba, an Edekiri language of the Niger-Congo family (Gordon 2005), is the native language of more than 30 million people in West Africa.",
        "Although it has many dialects, all speakers can communicate effectively using Standard Yoruba (SY), which is used in education, mass media and everyday communication (Adewole 1988).",
        "We represent our realizational analysis of SY in the KATR formalism (Finkel, Shen, Stump & Thesayi 2002).",
        "KATR is based on DATR, a formal language for representing lexical knowledge designed and implemented by Roger Evans and Gerald Gazdar (Evans & Gazdar 1989).",
        "Our information about SY is primarily due to the expertise of the second author.",
        "This research is part of a larger effort aimed at elucidating the morphological structure of natural languages.",
        "In particular, we are interested in identifying the ways in which default-inheritance relations describe a language's morphology as well as the theoretical relevance of the traditional notion of principal parts.",
        "To this end, we have applied similar techniques to Hebrew (Finkel & Stump 2007), Latin (Finkel & Stump to appear, 2009b), and French (Finkel & Stump to appear, 2009a).",
        "As we demonstrate below, the realizational approach leads to a KATR theory that provides a clear picture of the morphology of SY verbs.",
        "Different audiences might find different aspects of it attractive.",
        "• A linguist can peruse the theory to gain an appreciation for the structure of SY verbs, with all exceptional cases clearly marked either by morphophonological diacritics or by rules of sandhi, which are segregated from all the other rules.",
        "• A teacher of the language can use the theory as a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology.",
        "• A student of the language can suggest verb roots and use the theory to generate all the appropriate forms, instead of locating the right paradigm in a book and substituting consonants."

        "The combinations form a total of 160 morphosyntactic property sets (MPSs).",

        "• Negator marker 1, which appears only in the negative, but is slightly influenced by person and number,",
        "• Tense, which realizes the tense, influenced by polarity,",
        "• Negator marker 2, which appears only in the negative, influenced by tense,",
        "• Stem, which realizes the verb's lexeme,",
        "• Ending, which appears only for emphatic verbs.",
        "Unlike many other languages, SY does not distinguish conjugations of verbs, making its KATR theory simpler than ones for languages such as Latin and Hebrew.",

        "The network of nodes constituting SY verb morphology is very simple: every lexeme is represented by a node that specifies its stem and then refers to the node Verb.",

        "A rule matches if all the atoms on its left-hand side match the atoms in the query.",
        "A rule can match even if its atoms do not exhaust the entire query.",
        "In the case of Take, the query <stem past> is matched by Rules 1 and 2; the query <positive past> is only matched by Rule 2.",

        "In particular, our KATR theory nicely accounts for the slot structure of SY verbs, even though most slots are dependent on multiple mor-phosyntactic properties, and we are easily able to deal with the tone shifts introduced by the emphatic suffix.",
        "This work is not intended to directly address the problem of parsing, that is, converting surface forms to pairings of lexemes with morphosyntactic properties.",
        "We believe that our KATR theory for SY correctly covers all verb forms, but there may certainly be exceptional cases that do not follow the structures we have presented.",
        "Such cases are usually easy to account for by introducing information in the leaf node of such lexemes.",
        "Further, this work is not in the area of automated learning, so questions of precision and ability to deal with unseen data are not directly relevant.",
        "We have constructed the SY theory in KATR instead of DATR for several reasons.",
        "• We have a very fast KATR implementation, making for speedy prototyping and iterative improvement in morphological theories.",
        "This implementation is capable of taking standard DATR theories as well.",
        "• KATR allows bracket notation ({ and }) on the left-hand side of rules, which makes it very easy to specify morphosyntactic properties for queries in any order and without mentioning those properties that are irrelevant to a given rule.",
        "Rules in DATR theories tend to have much more complicated left-hand sides, obscuring the morphological rules.",
        "• KATR has a syntax for Sandhi that separates its computation, which we see as postprocessing of surface forms, from the application of morphological rules.",
        "It is possible to write rules for Sandhi in DATR, but the rules are both unpleasant to write and difficult to describe.",
        "As we have noted elsewhere (Finkel & Stump 2007), writing KATR specifications requires considerable effort.",
        "Early choices color the structure of the resulting theory, and the author must often discard attempts and rethink how to represent the target morphology.",
        "The first author, along with Gregory Stump, has built KATR theories for verbs in Hebrew, Slovak, Polish, Spanish, Irish, Shughni (an Iranian language of the Pamir) and Lingala (a Bantu language of the Congo), as well as for parts of Hungarian, Sanskrit, and Pali."
