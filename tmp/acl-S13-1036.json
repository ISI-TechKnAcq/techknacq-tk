        "In recent years, with the growing popularity of social media applications, there has been a steep rise in the amount of ?post?-based user-generated text (including microblog posts, status updates and comments) (Bennett, 2012).",
        "This data has been identified as having potential for applications ranging from trend analysis (Lau et al., 2012a) and event detection (Osborne et al., 2012) to election outcome prediction (O?Connor et al., 2010).",
        "However, given that posts are generally very short, noisy and lacking in context, traditional NLP approaches tend to perform poorly over social media data (Hong and Davison, 2010; Ritter et al., 2011; Han et al., 2012).",
        "This is the first paper to address the task of lexical semantic interpretation in microblog data based on word usage similarity.",
        "Word usage similarity (USIM: Erk et al. (2009)) is a relatively new paradigm for capturing similarity in the usages of a given word independently of any lexicon or sense inventory.",
        "The task is to rate on an ordinal scale the similarity in usage between two different usages of the same word.",
        "In doing so, it avoids common issues in conventional word sense disambiguation, relating to sense underspecification, the appropriateness of a static sense inventory to a given domain, and the inability to capture similarities/overlaps between word senses.",

        "The task is to predict a real-valued number in the range [1, 5] for the similarity in the respective usages of paper, where 1 indicates the usages are completely different and 5 indicates they are identical.",
        "In this paper we develop a new USIM dataset based on Twitter data.",
        "In experiments on this dataset we demonstrate that an LDA-based topic modelling approach outperforms a baseline distributional semantic approach and Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization (WTMF: Guo and Diab (2012a)).",

        "Erk et al. (2009) showed that, given a sense inventory, there is a high likelihood of multiple senses being compatible with a given usage, and proposed USIM as a means of capturing the similarity in usage between a pairing of usages of a given word.",
