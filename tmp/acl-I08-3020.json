        "Effective and fluent machine translation poses many challenges, and often requires a variety of resources.",
        "Some are language-specific, some domain-specific, and others manage to be relatively independent (one might even say context-free), and thus generally applicable in a wide variety of circumstances.",
        "There are still untapped resources, however, that might benefit machine translation systems.",
        "Most statistical approaches do not take into account any similarities in word forms, so words that share a common root, (like \"blanche\" and \"bianca\", meaning \"white\" in French and Italian respectively) are no more likely to be aligned than others (like \"vache\" and \"guardare\", meaning \"cow\" and \"to watch\" respectively).",
        "Such a root is sometimes subject to vowel shift and consonant gradation, and may not be reflected in orthography, since it is often purely phonetic.",
        "This means we are not taking advantage of everything that normally benefits human speakers, hearers and translators.",
        "It may be that a more natural approach to translation would first involve understanding of the input, stored in some mental representation (an interlingua), and then generation of an equivalent phrase in the target language, directly from the knowledge sources.",
        "In order to allow for more dramatic differences in grammar like agglutinativity, it seems that the statistical machine translation (SMT) system must be more aware of sub-word units (morphemes) and features (phonetic similarity).",
        "This general sort of morphological approach could potentially benefit any language pair, but might be crucial for a system that handles Finnish, Turkish, Hungarian, Estonian or any other highly inflectional language.",
        "In the following section we discuss the confounds presented by agglutinative languages, and how awareness of morphemes might improve the situation.",
        "This is followed by a brief foray into semantics and natural language generation as a component of SMT.",
        "Capturing phonetic features is most applicable to speech-to-speech translation, which will be discussed in the penultimate section.",
        "A description of the Bible conversation experiment and some of its results can be found in the final section."

      "heading": "2. Agglutinative Confounds",
      "text": [
        "Traditional n-gram language models and phrase-based translation models do not work terribly well for Finnish because each lexical item can appear in dozens of inflected or declined forms.",
        "If an SMT system is presented with \"taloosi\" (to your house), it will not know if that is another form of a word it saw in training (like \"taloissaan\", in their houses).",
        "Alignment data are thus unnaturally sparse and test sentences often contain several unknown items, which share their stems with trained words.",
        "It has been assumed that morphological analysis would be essential for handling agglutinative languages.",
        "However, although several effective segmenters and analyzers for specific languages exist, and even unsupervised language-neutral versions such as Morfes-sor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), only recently have similar approaches been successfully used in the context of machine translation to improve the BLEU score (Oflazer and El-Kahlout, 2007), and none yet in Finnish.",
        "In our experience, building a translation model through stemmed (truncated) word-alignment outperforms full-form alignment, or any morph-segmented alignment.",
        "But once one has generated such a translation model, including phrase tables where stemmed forms (keys in source language) are associated with full forms (values in target language), is there anything to be gained from induction of morphology?",
        "Our research in this area has yet to reveal any positive results, but we are still working on it.",
        "It is also worth considering the effectiveness of the evaluation metrics.",
        "Does BLEU accurately capture the accuracy of a translation, particularly in an agglutinative language?",
        "Unfortunately not.",
        "We think the word segmentation in the BLEU metric is biased against progress in morpheme-level translation.",
        "Some other metrics have been set forth, but none is widely accepted, in part due to inertia, but also because translation cannot be objectively evaluated, unless both the communicative intent and its effectiveness can be quantified.",
        "The same problem occurs for teachers grading essays â€“ what was the student intending to convey, was the phrasing correct, the argument sound, and where does all this diverge from the underlying power of words, written or well said, to transmit information?",
        "Translation is an art, and maybe in addition to human evaluation by linguists and native speakers of the language, we should consider the equivalent of an art or literary critic.",
        "On the other hand, that might only be worthwhile for poetry, wherein automated translation is perhaps not the best approach.",
        "One might think that the stemmed model described above would lose track of closed-class function items (like prepositions), particularly when they are represented as inflectional morphemes in one language but as separate words in the other.",
        "However, it seems that the language model for the target takes care of that quite well in most cases.",
        "There are some languages (like Japanese) with underspecified noun phrases, in which efforts to preserve definiteness (i.e., the book, kirjan; a book, kirjaa) seem futile, but given the abundance of monolingual data to train LM's on, these are contextually inferred and corrected at the tail end of the production line.",
        "Agglutinative confounds are thus very closely related to other issues found throughout machine translation, and perhaps an integrated solution (including a new evaluation metric) is necessary."

      "text": [
        "Incorporating statistical natural language generation into a machine translation system involves some modifications to the above.",
        "First, the source language is translated or parsed into ontological representations.",
        "This is similar to sentence parsing techniques that can be used to induce a context-free grammar for a language (Charniak, 1997), and could in fact be considered one of their more useful applications.",
        "The parsing generally depends on a probabilistic model trained on sentences aligned with their syntactic and semantic representations, often in a tree that could be generated by a context-free grammar.",
        "The resulting semantic representation can then be used as the source of a target-language generation process.",
        "The algorithm that generates such a representation from raw input could be trained on a treebank, and an annotated form of the same corpus (where the derivations in the generation space are associated with counts for each decision made) can be used to train the output component to generate language.",
        "(Belz, 2005) To incorporate the statistical component, which allows for robust generalization, per (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995), the NLG on the target side is filtered through a language model (described above).",
        "This helps address many of the knowledge gap problems introduced by linguistic differences or in a component of the system - the analyzer or generator.",
        "This approach does have significant advantages, particularly in that it is more focused on semantics (as opposed to statistical cooccurrence), so it may be less likely to distort meaning.",
        "On the other hand, it could misinterpret or miscommunicate (or both), just like a human translator.",
        "Perhaps the crucial difference is that, while machine learning often has little to do with our understanding of cognitive processes, this sort of machine translation has greater potential for illuminating mysterious areas of the human process.",
        "It is not an ersatz brain, nor neural network, but in many ways it has more in common with those technologies (particularly in that they model cognition) than many natural language processing algorithms.",
        "That is because, if we can get a semantically-aware machine translation system to work, it may more closely mirror human cognition.",
        "Humans certainly do not ignore meaning when they translate, but today's statistical machine translation has no awareness of it at all.",
        "Potential disadvantages of the system include its dependence on more resources.",
        "However, this is less of a problem with WordNet(Miller, 1995) and other such semantic webs.",
        "It is also worth mentioning again that humans always have an incredible amount of information at their disposal when translating.",
        "Not only all of their past experience and word-knowledge, but their interlocutor's demeanor, manner, intonation, facial expressions, gestures, and so on.",
        "There are often things that would be obvious in the context of a conversation, but are missing from the transcribed text.",
        "For instance, the referent of many pronouns is ambiguous, but usually there is a unique individual or item picked out by the speakers' shared information.",
        "This is true for simple sentences like \"He hit him,\" which are normally disambiguated by conversational context, but a purely statistical, pseudo-syntactic interpretation would get little of the meaning a human would glean from that utterance."

        "Speech-to-speech machine translation is in some ways the peak of natural language processing, in that it deals directly with our (humans') original, oral mode of communication (as opposed to derived written language).",
        "As such, it presents challenges that are not to be taken lightly.",
        "Much of the pipeline involved is at least relatively straightforward: acoustic modeling and language modeling on the input side can take advantage of the latest advances without extensive adaptation; similarly, speech synthesis on the output can be directly connected with the system (i.e., not work with text output, but a richer representation).",
        "Although such a system might seem quite complicated, it could better take advantage of all the available data.",
        "Natural language understanding and generation could even be incorporated to an extent, perhaps to add further confidence measures based on semantic equivalence.",
        "Designing it in this way also allows for a variety of methods to be tried with ease, in a modular fashion.",
        "It may be that yet another source of information can be found to improve the translation by adding features to the translation model â€“ perhaps leveraging multilingual corpora in other languages, segmenting into morphemes earlier in the process, or even incorporating intonation in some fashion.",
        "Weights for all such features could be learned during training, such that no language-specific tuning would be necessary.",
        "This framework would certainly not make speech-to-speech translation simple, but its flexibility might make research and improvement in this area more tractable.",
        "Efficiency is crucial in online translation of conversation, so a word alignment model with collapsed Gibbs sampling, rather than EM, at its core is worth experimenting with.",
        "We have written up a bare-bones IBM Model 1 in both C++ and Python, using the standard EM approach and a Gibbs sampling one.",
        "The latter allows for optimizations using linear algebra, and although it does not quite match the perplexity or log-likelihood achieved by EM, it is significantly faster, particularly on longer sentences.",
        "Since morpheme segmentation is at least somewhat helpful in speech recognition (Creutz, 2006; Creutz et al., 2007), it should still be considered a potential component in speech-to-speech translation.",
        "In terms of incorporating the knowledge-based approach into such a system, we think it may yet be too early, but if existing understanding-and-generation frameworks for machine translation could be adapted to this use, it could be very fruitful, in particular since spoken language generation might be more effective from a knowledge base, since it would know what it was trying to say, instead of relying on statistics alone, hoping the phonemes end up in a meaningful order.",
        "The critical step of SST is, of course, translation.",
        "In an integrated system, as described above, the translation model could be trained on a parallel spoken corpus (perhaps tokenized into phonemes, or segmented into morphemes), since there might be advantages to limiting the intermediate steps in the process.",
        "The Bible is a massively multilingual publication, and as it happens, its text is available aligned between Finnish and English, and it is possible to find corresponding recordings in both languages.",
        "So, this corpus would enable a direct approach to speech-to-speech translation.",
        "Alternatively, one could treat the speech recognition and synthesis as distinct from the translation, in which case text corpora corresponding to the style and genre of speech would be necessary.",
        "This would be particularly feasible when, for instance, translating UN parliamentary proceedings from a recording, for which translated transcripts are readily available.",
        "For a more general and robust solution, we might advocate a combined approach, in the hope that some potential weaknesses of one might be avoided or compensated for by using whatever limited resources are available to add features from the other.",
        "Thus, a direct translation from speech to speech could be informed, in a sense, by a derived translation from the recognized text."

        "If a system is efficient enough to be used without introducing significant delay, it can translate conversational speech online, acting as an interpreter in place of (or in cooperation with) a human professional.",
        "On the other hand, a slow speech translation system is still useful because it can make news broadcasts (radio or television) accessible to wider audiences through offline multilingual dubbing, allowing international viewers to enjoy a delayed broadcast.",
        "The domain selected for our experiments was heavily influenced by the available data.",
        "We needed a bilingual (Finnish and English) and bimodal (text and speech) corpus, and unfortunately none is readily available, but we put one together using the Bible.",
        "Both Old and New Testaments were used, with one book from each left out for testing purposes.",
        "We used multiple editions of the Bible to train the translation model: the American Standard Version (first published in 1901, updated 1997), and Finnish translations (from 1992 and 1933,38).",
        "The spoken recordings used were the World English Bible (1997) and Finnish Bible (Raamattu) readings (recorded at TKK 2004).",
        "Our approach was to use existing components, and try weaving them together in an optimal way.",
        "First, there is the open vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, where the goal is to detect phonemes in an acoustic signal and map them to words.",
        "Here, we use an \"unlimited vocabulary\" continuous speech recognizer (Hirsimaki et al., 2006), trained on a multi-speaker Finnish acoustic model with a varigram (Siivola et al., 2007) language model that includes Bible n-grams.",
        "Then, for translation, Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) is trained on words and morphemes (derived from Morfessor Baseline (Creutz and Lagus, 2005)).",

        "Or, they could still be statistical, but optimized for the translation phase by minimizing perplexity during word alignment.",
        "A significant barrier to thorough and concrete evaluation of our system involves segmentation of the speech stream into sentences (or verses) to match the text.",
        "In the above examples, we manually clipped the audio files.",
        "Evaluating performance on the entire test set reduced the BLEU score if the data were streamed through each component unsegmented.",
        "When the recognizer was set to insert a period for detected pauses of a certain length, or at sentence boundaries identified by its language model, input to the translation phase became considerably more problematic.",
        "In particular, the lattice input ought to be split into sentences, but there would usually be a period in every time slice (but with low probability).",
        "There were significant difficulties in the process, particularly in the English to Finnish direction.",
        "Whereas Finnish speech recognition is relatively straightforward, since its orthography is consistent, English speech recognition is more dependent on a pronunciation dictionary.",
        "Although many such dictionaries are available, and the pronunciation of novel words can be estimated, neither of these resources is terribly effective within the Bible domain, where there are many archaic words and names.",
        "In the second step, translation into Finnish is demonstrably difficult from any source language, and results in consistently lower BLEU scores (Virpioja et al., 2007).",
        "And although using morphemes can reduce the frequency of unknown words, it also reduces the BLEU score.",
        "It might improve translation quality if we use the recognizer lattice as translator input, since acoustically improbable segments may lead to the most fluent translation.",
        "Having access to many possibilities might help the translation model, but then again, second-guessing the recognizer might not be helpful.",
        "There were some difficulties with the Moses integration, in part because the word-sausage format varies from SRILM's.",
        "Also, the recognizer output indicates word boundaries as <w>, not string-final hash-marks (#).",
        "This is problematic since the former are separate symbols, occupying a node in the lattice, whereas the latter are appended to another symbol (e.g., \"<w> morpheme </w>\", 4 nodes, versus \"morph eme#\", 2 nodes).",
        "Using the lattice, final output from Moses tends to be more fluent, but less on-topic, and often truncated.",
        "Although we have no improvements thus far, it is likely that with further parameter tuning, we could achieve better results.",
        "On the other hand, we seek a general, robust, domain-independent solution, so focusing on Bible translation may not be worthwhile.",

        "A potential barrier to this and other applications is the lack of spoken language training texts.",

        "We cannot yet say for sure whether linguistic or statistically optimized morphemes derived from text corpora could be useful somehow in machine translation, but it has been demonstrated helpful in speech recognition.",
        "Awareness of sub-word units could benefit a speech-to-speech translation system, and it may in fact help to maintain information from the speech recognizer about morpheme segmentation throughout the translation process, even in speech generation.",
        "Incorporating natural language understanding may also be fruitful, but for compact, efficient systems (like a handheld translator) might not have access to the necessary resources or computational power to support that.",
        "On the other hand, it is our duty as researchers to stay ahead of the technology and push its limits.",
        "We are by no means the first to imagine this, but perhaps we will soon be speaking into wrist watches that understand our query, seemingly instantly shift through more information than Google has currently indexed, and reply in fluent English, Finnish, or Punjabi with as much detail as could be hoped for after hours of painstaking research with current technology.",
        "In this case (and computational linguists must always be optimistic), knowledge-based natural language processing certainly has a crucial place.",
        "Morphemes and agglutinative languages do pose unique problems for computational linguists, but many of the general techniques developed for languages like Arabic and Chinese, which are equally far from English in grammar (and even orthography), might surmount those problems without any manual adaptation.",
        "Discriminative training of features used in the translation model allows for such solutions to be molded automatically to whatever language pair (and set of corpora) they are being used for.",
        "There is, as always, much more to be done in this area, and we hope our research into efficient, online Bible-conversational translation â€“ a modern Babelfish in an ancient genre â€“ is fruitful, and helps to shed light on lemmatization."
