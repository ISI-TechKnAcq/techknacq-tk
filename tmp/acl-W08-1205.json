        "As a result, this unreliability poses a serious issue for the development and evaluation of NLP tools in the task of automatically detecting preposition usage errors in the writing of non-native speakers of English.",
        "To date, single human annotation has typically been the gold standard for grammatical error detection, such as in the work of (Izumi et al., 2004), (Han et al., 2006), (Nagata et al., 2006), (Gamon et al., 2008).",

        "pora annotated for preposition and determiner errors (such as the Cambridge Learners Corpus and the Chinese Learner English Corpus), it is unclear which portions of these, if any, were doubly annotated.",
        "This previous work has sidestepped the issue of annotator reliability, which we address here through the following three contributions:",
        "• Judgments of Native Usage To motivate our work in non-native usage, we first illustrate the difficulty of preposition selection with two experiments: a cloze test and a choice test, where native speakers judge native texts (section 4).",
        "• Judgments of Non-Native Usage As stated earlier, most computational work in the field of error detection tools for non-native speakers has relied on a single rater to annotate a gold standard corpus to check a system's output.",
        "We conduct an extensive double-annotation evaluation to measure inter-rater reliability and show that using one rater can be unreliable and may produce misleading results in a system test (section 5).",
        "• Sampling Approach Multiple annotation can be very costly and time-consuming, which may explain why previous work employed only one rater.",
        "As an alternative to the standard exhaustive annotation, we propose a sampling approach in which estimates of the rates of hits, false positives, and misses are derived from random samples of the system's output, and then precision and recall of the system can be calculated.",
        "We show that estimates of system performance derived",
        "from the sampling approach are comparable to those derived from an exhaustive annotation, but require only a fraction of the effort (section 6).",
        "In short, through a battery of experiments we show how rating preposition usage, in either native or non-native texts, is a task that has surprisingly low inter-annotator reliability and thus greatly impacts system evaluation.",
        "We then describe a method for efficiently annotating non-native texts to make multiple annotation more feasible.",
        "In section 2, we discuss in more depth the motivation for detecting usage errors in non-native writing, as well as the complexities of preposition usage.",
        "In section 3, we describe a system that automatically detects preposition errors involving incorrect selection and extraneous usage.",
        "In sections 4 and 5 respectively, we discuss experiments on the reliability of judging native and non-native preposition usage.",
        "In section 6, we present results of our system and results from comparing the sampling approach with the standard approach of exhaustive annotation."

      "text": [
        "The long-term goal of our work is to develop a system which detects errors in grammar and usage so that appropriate feedback can be given to non-native English writers, a large and growing segment of the world's population.",
        "Estimates are that in China alone as many as 300 million people are currently studying English as a foreign language.",
        "Even in predominantly English-speaking countries, the proportion of non-native speakers can be very substantial.",
        "For example, the US National Center for Educational Statistics (2002) reported that nearly 10% of the students in the US public school population speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency .",
        "At the university level in the US, there are estimated to be more than half a million foreign students whose native language is not English (Burghardt, 2002).",
        "Clearly, there is an increasing demand for tools for instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL).",
        "Some of the most common types of ESL usage errors involve prepositions, determiners and collocations.",
        "In the work discussed here, we target preposition usage errors, specifically those of incorrect selection (\"we arrived to the station\") and extraneous use (\"he went to outside\").",
        "Preposition errors account for a substantial proportion of all ESL usage errors.",
        "For example, (Bitchener et al., 2005) found that preposition errors accounted for 29% of all the errors made by intermediate to advanced ESL students.",
        "In addition, such errors are relatively common.",
        "In our learner corpora, we found that 6% of all prepositions were incorrectly used.",
        "Some other estimates are even higher: for example, (Izumi et al., 2003) reported error rates that were as high as 10% in a Japanese learner corpus.",
        "At least part of the difficulty in mastering prepositions seems to be due to the great variety of linguistic functions that they serve.",
        "When a preposition marks the argument of a predicate, such as a verb, an adjective, or a noun, preposition selection is constrained by the argument role that it marks, the noun which fills that role, and the particular predicate.",
        "Many English verbs also display alternations (Levin, 1993) in which an argument is sometimes marked by a preposition and sometimes not (e.g., \"They loaded the wagon with hay\" / \"They loaded hay on the wagon\").",
        "When prepositions introduce adjuncts, such as those of time or manner, selection is constrained by the object of the preposition (\"at length\", \"in time\", \"with haste\").",
        "Finally, the selection of a preposition for a given context also depends upon the intention of the writer (\"we sat at the beach\", \"on the beach\", \"near the beach\", \"by the beach\")."

        "In this section, we give a description of our system and compare its performance to other systems.",
        "Although the focus of this paper is on human judgments in the task of error detection, we describe our system to show that variability in human judgments can impact the evaluation of a system in this task.",
        "A full description of our system and its performance can be found in (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008).",
        "Our approach treats preposition error detection as a classification problem: that is, given a context of two words before and two words after the writer's preposition, what is the best preposition to use?",
        "An error is marked when the system's suggestion differs from the writer's by a certain threshold amount.",
        "We have used a maximum entropy (ME) classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to select the most probable preposition for a given context from a set of 34 common English prepositions.",
        "One advantage of using ME is that there are implementations of it which can handle very large models built from millions of training events and consisting of hundreds of thousands of feature-value pairs.",
        "To construct a model, we begin with a training corpus that is POS-tagged and heuristically chunked into noun phrases and verb phrases.",
        "For each preposition that occurs in the training corpus, a preprocessing program extracts a total of 25 features.",
        "These consist of words and POS tags in positions adjacent to the preposition and in the heads of nearby phrases.",
        "In addition, we include combination features that merge the head features.",
        "We also include features representing only the tags to be able to cover cases in testing where the words in the context were not seen in training.",
        "In many NLP tasks (parsing, POS-tagging, pronoun resolution), it is easy to acquire training data that is similar to the testing data.",
        "However, in the case of grammatical error detection, one does not have that luxury because reliable error-annotated ESL corpora that are large enough for training a statistical classifier simply do not exist.",
        "To circumvent this problem, we have trained our classifier on examples of prepositions used correctly, as in news text.",
        "Before evaluating our system on non-native writing, we evaluated how well it does on the task of preposition selection in native text, an area where there has been relatively little work to date.",
        "In this task, the system predicts the writer's preposition based on its context.",
        "Its prediction is scored automatically by comparison to what the writer actually wrote.",
        "Most recently, (Gamon et al., 2008) addressed preposition selection by developing a system that combined a decision tree and a language model.",
        "Besides the difference in algorithms, there is also a difference in coverage between their system, which selects among 13 prepositions plus a category for Other, and the system presented here, which selects among 34 prepositions.",
        "In their system evaluation, they split a corpus of Reuters News text and Microsoft Encarta into two sets: 70% for training (3.2M examples), and the remaining 30% for testing (1.4M examples).",
        "For purposes of comparison, we used the same corpus and evaluation method.",
        "While (Gamon et al., 2008) do not present their overall accuracy figures on the Encarta evaluation, they do present the precision and recall scores for each preposition.",
        "In Table 3.2, we display their results in terms of F-measures and show the performance of our system for each preposition.",
        "Our model outperforms theirs for 9 out of the 10 prepositions that both systems handle.",
        "Overall accuracy for our system is 77.4% and increases to 79.0% when 7M more training examples are added.",
        "For comparison purposes, using a majority baseline (always selecting the preposition of) in this domain results in an accuracy of 27.2%.",
        "(Felice and Pullman, 2007) used perceptron classifiers for preposition selection in BNC News Text at 85% accuracy.",
        "For each of the five most frequent prepositions, they used a separate binary classifier to decide whether that preposition should be used or not.",
        "The classifiers are not combined into a unified model.",
        "When we reconfigured our system and evaluation to be comparable to (Felice and Pullman, 2007), our model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the same five prepositions when tested on Wall Street Journal News, which is similar, though not identical, to BNC News.",
        "While systems can perform at close to 80% accuracy in the task of preposition selection in native texts, this high performance does not transfer to the end-task of detecting preposition errors in essays by non-native writers.",
        "For example, (Izumi et al., 2003) reported precision and recall as low as 25% and 7% respectively when detecting different grammar errors (one of which was prepositions) in English essays by non-native writers.",
        "(Gamon et al., 2008) reported precision up to 80% in their evaluation on the CLEC corpus, but no recall figure was reported.",
        "We have found that our system (the model which performs at 77.4%), also performs as high as 80% precision, but recall ranged from 12% to 26% depending on the non-native test corpus.",

        "With so many sources of variation in English preposition usage, we wondered if the task of selecting a preposition for a given context might prove challenging even for native speakers.",
        "To investigate this possibility, we randomly selected 200 sentences from Microsoft's Encarta Encyclopedia, and, in each sentence, we replaced a randomly selected preposition with a blank.",
        "We then asked two native English speakers to perform a cloze task by filling in the blank with the best preposition, given the context provided by the rest of the sentence.",
        "In addition, we had our system predict which preposition should fill each blank as well.",
        "Our results (Table 2) showed only about 76% agreement between the two raters (bottom row), and between 74% and 78% when each rater was compared individually with the original preposition used in Encarta.",
        "Surprisingly, the system performed just as well as the two native raters, when compared with Encarta (third row).",
        "Although these results seem very promising, it should be noted that in many cases where the system disagreed with Encarta, its prediction was not a good fit for the context.",
        "But in the cases where the raters disagreed with Encarta, their prepositions were also licensed by the context, and thus were acceptable alternatives to the preposition that was used in the text.",
        "Our cloze study shows that even with wellformed text, native raters can disagree with each other by 25% in the task of preposition selection.",
        "We can expect even more disagreement when the task is preposition error detection in \"noisy\" learner texts.",

        "To investigate how the exact match metric might underestimate system performance, and to further test the reliability of human judgments in native text, we conducted a choice test in which two native English speakers were presented with 200 sentences from Encarta and were asked to select which of two prepositions better fit the context.",

        "Next the annotator noted determiner or plural errors in the context, and then checked if there were any other grammatical errors (for example, wrong verb form).",

        "When comparing human judgments to the performance of the preposition module, the latter should not be penalized for other kinds of errors in the context.",

        "In these cases, the annotator was instructed to use the \"e\" category and list the other equally plausible alternatives.",
        "After judging the use of the preposition and, if applicable, supplying alternatives, the annotator indicated her confidence in her judgment on a 2-point scale of \"1-low\" and \"2-high\".",

        "After removing instances where there were spelling or grammar errors, and after combining categories \"2\" and \"e\", both of which were judgments of correct usage, we computed the kappa values for the remaining doubly judged sets.",

        "As one would expect given the prior reports of preposition error rates in non-native writing, the raters' agreement for this task was quite high overall (0.952) due primarily to the large agreement count where both annotators rated the usage \"OK\" (1213 total contexts).",
        "However there were 42 prepositions that both raters marked as a \"Wrong Choice\" and 17 as \"Extraneous.\"",
        "It is important to note the disagreements in judging these errors: for example, Rater 1 judged 26 prepositions to be errors that Rater 2 judged to be OK, for a disagreement rate of .302 (26/86).",
        "Similarly, Rater 2 judged 37 prepositions to be errors that Rater 1 judged to be OK, for a disagreement rate of .381 (37/97).",
        "The kappa of 0.630 and the off-diagonal cells in the confusion matrix both show the difficulty of this task and also show how two highly trained raters can produce very different judgments.",
        "This suggests that for certain error annotation tasks, such as preposition usage, it may not be appropriate to use only one rater and that using two or more raters to produce an adjudicated gold-standard set is the more acceptable path.",
