        "Discourse coherence is an important aspect in natural language generation (NLG) applications.",
        "A number of theories have investigated coherence inducing factors.",
        "A prominent example is Centering Theory (Grosz et al1995), which models local coherence by relating the choice of referring expressions to the importance of an entity at a certain stage of a discourse.",
        "A data-driven model based on this theory is the entity-based approach by Barzilay and Lapata (2008), which models coherence phenomena by observing sentence-to-sentence transitions of entity occurrences.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata show that their approach can discriminate between a coherent and a non-coherent set of ordered sentences.",
        "However, their model is not able to generate alternative entity realizations by itself.",
        "Furthermore, the entity-based approach only investigates realization patterns for individual entities in discourse in terms of core grammatical functions.",
        "It does not investigate the interplay between entity transitions and realization patterns for full-fledged semantic structures.",
        "This interplay, however, is an important factor for a semantics-based, generative model of discourse coherence.",
        "The main hypothesis of our work is that we can automatically learn context-specific realization patterns for predicate argument structures (PAS) from a semantically parsed corpus of comparable text pairs.",
        "Our assumption builds on the success of previous research, where comparable and parallel texts have been exploited for a range of related learning tasks, e.g., unsupervised discourse segmentation (Barzilay and Lee, 2004) and bootstrapping semantic analyz-ers (Titov and Kozhevnikov, 2010).",
        "For our purposes, we are interested in finding corresponding PAS across comparable texts that are known to talk about the same events, and hence involve the same set of underlying event participants.",
        "By aligning predicates in such texts, we can investigate the factors that determine discourse coherence in the realization patterns for the involved arguments.",
        "These include the specific forms of argument realization, as a pronoun or a specific type of referential expression, as studied in prior work in NLG (Belz et al2009, inter alia).",
        "The specific set-up we examine, however, allows us to further investi",
        "gate the factors that govern the non-realization of an argument position, as a special form of coherence inducing element in discourse.",
        "Example (1), extracted from our corpus of aligned texts,illustrates this point: Both texts report on the same event of locating victims in an avalanche.",
        "While (1.a) explicitly talks about the location of this event, the role remains implicit in the second sentence of (1.b), given that it can be recovered from the preceding sentence.",

        "Thus, our aim is to identify comparable predications across aligned texts, and to study the discourse coherence factors that determine the realization patterns of arguments in the respective discourses.",
        "This can be achieved by considering the full set of arguments that can be recovered from the aligned predications.",
        "This paper focuses on the first of these tasks, henceforth called predicate alignment.2 In line with data-driven approaches in NLP, we automatically align predicates in a suitable corpus of paired texts.",
        "The induced alignments will (i) serve to identify events described in both comparable texts, and (ii) provide information about the underlying argument structures and how they are realized in each context to establish a coherent discourse.",

        "The task of aligning words in general has been studied extensively in previous work, for example as part of research in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Typically, alignment models in SMT are trained by observing and (re-)estimating co-occurrence counts of word pairs in parallel sentences (Brown et al. 1993).",
        "The same methods have also been applied in monolingual settings, for example to align words in paraphrases (Cohn et al2008).",
        "In contrast to traditional word alignment tasks, our focus is not on pairs of isolated sentences but on aligning predicates within the discourse contexts in which they are situated.",
        "Furthermore, text pairs for our task should not be strictly parallel as we are specifically interested in the impact of different discourse contexts.",
        "In Section 5, we will show that this particular setting indeed constitutes a more challenging task compared to traditional word alignment in parallel or paraphrasing sentences.",
        "Another set of related tasks is found in the area of textual inference.",
        "Since 2006, there have been regular challenges on the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE).",

        "Although this relation does not necessarily require the presence of corresponding predicates, previous work by MacCartney et al2008) shows that word alignments can serve as a good indicator of entailment.",
        "As a matter of fact, the same holds true for the task of detecting paraphrases.",
        "In contrast to RTE, this latter task requires bidirectional entailments, i.e., each of the two phrases must entail the other.",
        "Wan et al. (2006) show that a simple approach solely based on word (and lemmatized n-gram) overlap can already achieve an F1-score of up to 83% for detecting paraphrases in the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (Dolan and Brockett, 2005, MSRPC).",
        "In fact, this is just 0.6% points below the state-of-the-art results recently reported by Socher et al2011).",
        "The MSRPC and data sets from the first RTE challenges only consisted of isolated pairs of sentences.",
        "The Fifth PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (Bentivogli et al2009) introduced a ?Search Task?, where entailing sentences for a hypothesis have to be found in a set of full documents.",
        "This new task first opened the doors for assessing the role of discourse (Mirkin et al2010a; Mirkin et al2010b) in RTE.",
        "However, this setting is still limited as discourse contexts are only provided for the entailing part (T ) of each text pair but not for the hypothesis H .",
        "A further task related to ours is the detection of event coreference.",
        "The goal of this task is to identify all mentions of the same event within a document and, in some settings, also across documents.",
        "However, the task setting is typically more restricted than ours in that its focus lies on identical events/references (cf. Walker et al2006), Weischedel et al2011), inter alia).",
        "In particular, verbalizations of different aspects of an event (e.g., ?buy??",
        "?sell?, ?kill??",
        "?die?, ?recover???find?)",
        "are generally not linked in this paradigm.",
        "In contrast to coreference methods that identify chains of events, we are interested in pairs of corresponding predicates (and their argument structure), for which we can observe alternative realizations in discourse."

        "A subset of these pairs forms an evaluation set, annotated with gold alignments that relate predications, which exhibit a (possibly partial) corresponding argument structure.",
        "We established that the annotation task, while difficult, can be performed with good inter-annotator agreement (?",

        "Our main contribution is a novel clustering approach using Mincuts for aligning predications across comparable texts.",
        "Our experiments established that recursive clustering improves on greedy selection methods by profiting from global information encoded in the graph representation.",
        "While the Mincut-based method is in itself unsupervised, a small amount of development data is needed to tune parameters for the construction of particularly suitable input graphs.",
        "We tested our full model against two additional baselines: simple heuristic alignment based on identical lemma forms and a combination of techniques from SMT and paraphrase detection.",
        "The evaluation for our novel task was complemented by a traditional word alignment task using established paraphrase data sets.",
        "We determined clear differences in performance for all models for the two types of task settings.",
        "While word alignment methods from SMT outperform the competing models in the sentence-based alignment tasks, they perform poorly in the discourse setting.",
        "In future work, we will enhance our model by incorporating more refined similarity measures including discourse-based criteria.",
        "We will further explore tuning techniques, e.g., a more suitable pre-selection method for edges in graph construction, in order to increase either precision or recall.",
        "The decision of optimizing towards one measure or another is clearly task-dependent.",
        "In our case, high precision is favorable as we plan to learn accurate discourse model parameters from the computed alignments.",
        "Even though such an optimization will result in an overall lower recall, application of the alignment model on the entire GigaPairs corpus can still provide us with a large amount of precise predicate alignments.",
        "Using this set of alignments, we will then proceed to exploit contextual information in order to learn a semantic model for discourse coherence in argument structure realization."
