      "text": [
        "The CANIS customer receives cables from sites world-wide, indexes the entities mentioned in these cables and stores that information for access by analysts at a later date.",
        "The CANIS customer indexes large quantities of information mostly manually, and wishes to reduce the human resources applied to this task.",
        "Incoming cables are processed, information is extracted and stored in Corporate Databases.",
        "Cables with useful data are abstracted and indexed.",
        "Abstracting captures information about the cable itself: its document number, source, date, etc.",
        "Indexing captures information about the entities described in the cable: their names, dates of birth, locations, etc.",
        "The result of the abstracting and indexing process is a set of index records about the entities that were described in a cable.",
        "When a cable has been abstracted and indexed, its index record(s) are placed in a queue so that they will be stored.",
        "When file maintenance is performed (periodically overnight), the index records are stored in the Corporate Database.",
        "The abstracting and indexing process is a time consuming and laborious task.",
        "Analysts must read every cable and extract the information that should be placed in the new index records or update existing records.",
        "Although the abstracting portion of the task has been automated, it is only a small part of the abstracting and indexing process.",
        "The majority of the effort is the indexing part of the process.",
        "At present, there is little or no automation support for the indexing part of the process.",
        "The CAMS prototype is intended to assist the CAMS customer with the cable indexing task.",
        "CAMS automatically extracts entity information, builds and updates index records from cables, and presents it for review.",
        "CAMS' analysts can 1) approve the system generated index records, 2) add more information to the system generated index records, or 3) ignore the system generated index records and create their own.",
        "CAMS also extracts and stores relationship information (such as family relations, employment, and affiliations).",
        "This information is not currently identified or stored during the manual indexing task.",
        "CAMS is compatible with both the input and output systems currently being used by the CAMS customer.",
        "CAMS runs on the customer-specified hardware and software platforms.",
        "However, the prototype CAMS system is a standalone system."
