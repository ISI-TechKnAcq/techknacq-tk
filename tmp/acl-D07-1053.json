        "Whatever the disease or impairment considered, oral communication is impossible for these persons who have in addition serious difficulties to control physically their environment.",
        "In particular, they are not able to use standard input devices of a computer.",
        "Most of the time, they can only handle a single switch device.",
        "As a result, communicating with an AAC system consists of typing messages by means of a virtual table of symbols (words, letters or icons) where the user successively selects the desired items.",
        "Basically, an AAC system, such as FASTY (Trost et al.",
        "2005) or SIBYLLE (Schadle et al., 2004), consists of four components.",
        "At first, one finds a physical input interface connected to the computer.",
        "This device is adapted to the motion capacities of the user.",
        "When the latter must be restricted to a single switch (eye glimpse or breath detector, for instance), the control of the environment is reduced to a mere Yes/No command.",
        "Secondly, a virtual keyboard is displayed on screen.",
        "It allows the user to select successively the symbols that compose the intended message.",
        "In SIBYLLE, key selection is achieved by pointing letters through a linear scan procedure: a cursor successively highlights each key of the keyboard.",
        "The last two components are a text editor (to write emails or other documents) and a speech synthesis module, which is used in case of spoken communication.",
        "The latest version of SIBYLLE works for French and German, and it is usable with any Windows™ application (text editor, web browser, mailer...), which means that the use of a specific editor is no longer necessary.",
        "The main weakness of AAC systems results from the slowness of message composition.",
        "On average, disabled people cannot type more than 1 to 5 words per minute; moreover, this task is very tiring.",

        "Considering a linear scan procedure, one could for instance dynamically reorganize the keyboard in order to present the most probable symbols at first.",
        "The second strategy tries to minimize the number of keystrokes to be made.",
        "Here, the system tries to predict the words which are likely to occur just after those already typed.",
        "The predicted word is then either directly displayed after the end of the inserted text (a method referred to as \"word completion\", cf. Boissiere and Dours, 1996), or a list of N-best (typically 3 to 7) predictions is provided on the virtual keyboard.",
        "When one of these predictions corresponds to the intended word, it can be selected by the user.",
        "As can be seen in figure 1, the interface of the SIBYLLE system presents such a list of most probable words to the user.",
        "Several approaches can be used to carry out word prediction.",
        "Most of the commercial AAC systems make only use of a simple lexicon: in this approach, the context is not considered.",
        "On the other hand, stochastic language models can provide a list of word suggestions, depending on the n-1 (typically n = 3 or 4) last inserted words.",
        "It is obvious that such a model cannot take into account long-distance dependencies.",
        "There have been attempts to integrate part-of-speech information (Fazly and Hirst, 2003) or more complex syntactic models (Schadle et al., 2004) to achieve a better prediction.",
        "In this paper, we will nevertheless limit our study to a standard 4-gram model as a baseline to make our results comparable.",

        "For about 10 to 15 years statistical language modeling has had a remarkable success in various NLP domains, for instance in speech recognition, machine translation, Part-of-Speech tagging, but also in word prediction systems.",
        "N-gram based language models (LM) estimate the probability of occurrence for a word, given a string of n-1 preceding words.",

        "Moreover, the larger n gets, the more important the problem of combinatorial explosion for the probability estimation becomes.",
        "A reasonable trade-off between performance and number of estimated events seems therefore to be an n of 3 to 5, including sophisticated techniques in order to estimate the probability of unseen events (smoothing methods).",
        "Whereas n-gram-like language models are already performing rather well in many applications, their capacities are also very limited in that they cannot exploit any deeper linguistic structure.",
        "Long-distance syntactic relationships are neglected as well as semantic or thematic constraints.",
        "In the past 15 years many attempts have been made to enrich language models with more complex syntactic and semantic models, with varying success (cf. (Rosenfeld, 1996), (Goodman, 2002) or in a word prediction task: (Fazly and Hirst, want to explore here an approach based on Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Several works have suggested the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in order to integrate semantic similarity to a language model (cf. Belle-garda, 1997; Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998).",
        "LSA models semantic similarity based on co-occurrence distributions of words, and it has shown to be helpful in a variety of NLP tasks, but also in the domain of cognitive modeling (Landauer et al., 1997).",
        "LSA is able to relate coherent contexts to specific content words, and it is good at predicting the occurrence of a content word in the presence of other thematically related terms.",
        "However, since it does not take word order into account (\"bag-of-words\" model) it is very poor at predicting their actual position within the sentence, and it is completely useless for the prediction of function words.",
        "Therefore, some attempts have been made to integrate the information coming from an LSA-based model with standard language models of the n-gram type.",
        "In the LSA model (Deerwester et al., 1990) a word wi is represented as a high-dimensional vector, derived by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from a term x document (or a term x term) co-occurrence matrix of a training corpus.",
        "In this framework, a context or history h (= w1, ... , wm) can be represented by the sum of the (already normalized) vectors corresponding to the words it contains (Landauer et al.",
        "1997):",
        "This vector reflects the meaning of the preceding (already typed) section, and it has the same dimensionality as the term vectors.",
        "It can thus be compared to the term vectors by well-known similarity measures (scalar product, cosine).",
        "We make the assumption that an utterance or a text to be entered is usually semantically cohesive.",
        "We then expect all word vectors to be close to the current context vector, whose corresponding words belong to the semantic field of the context.",
        "This forms the basis for a simple probabilistic model of LSA: After calculating the cosine similarity for each word vector wi with the vector h of the current context, we could use the normalized similarities as probability values.",
        "This probability distribution however is usually rather flat (i.e. the dynamic range is low).",
        "For this reason a contrasting (or temperature) factor g is normally applied (cf. Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998), which raises the cosine to some power (g is normally between 3 and 8).",
        "After normalization we obtain a probability distribution which can be used for prediction purposes.",
        "It is calculated as follows:",
        "wi is a word in the vo cabulary, h is the current context (history) wi andh are their corresponding vectors in the LSA space; cosmin( h ) returns the lowest cosine value measured for h ).",

        "We therefore need to find an appropriate way to integrate the information coming from a standard n-gram model and the LSA approach.",
        "Measuring relation quality in an LSA space, Wandmacher (2005) pointed out that the reliability of LSA relations varies strongly between terms.",
