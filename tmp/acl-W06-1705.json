      "text": [
        "Linguistic annotation of corpora contributes crucially to the study of language at several levels: morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse.",
        "Its significance is reflected both in the growing interest in annotation software for word sense tagging (Edmonds and Kilgarriff, 2002) and in the long-standing use of part-of-speech taggers, parsers and morphological analysers for data from English and many other languages.",
        "Linguists, lexicographers, social scientists and other researchers are using ever larger amounts of corpus data in their studies.",
        "In corpus linguistics the progression has been from the 1 million-word Brown and LOB corpora of the 1960s, to the 100 million-word British National Corpus of the 1990s.",
        "In lexicography this progression is paralleled, for example, by Collins Dictionaries’ initial 10 million word corpus growing to their current corpus of around 600 million words.",
        "In addition, the requirement for mega and even giga-corpora1 extends to other applications, such as lexical frequency studies, neologism research, and statistical natural language processing where models of sparse data are built.",
        "The motivation for increasingly large data sets remains the same.",
        "Due to the Zipfian nature of word frequencies, around half the word types in a corpus occur only once, so tremendous increases in corpus size are required both to ensure inclusion of essential word and phrase types and to increase the chances of multiple occurrences of a given type.",
        "In corpus linguistics building such mega-corpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible (Kennedy, 1998: 56) unless the web is used as a corpus (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).",
        "Increasingly, corpus researchers are tapping the Web to overcome the sparse data problem (Keller et al., 2002).",
        "This topic generated intense interest at workshops held at the University of Heidelberg (October 2004), University of Bologna (January 2005), University of Birmingham (July 2005) and now in Trento in April 2006.",
        "In addition, the advantages of using linguistically annotated data over raw data are well documented (Mair, 2005; Granger and Rayson, 1998).",
        "As the size of a corpus increases, a near linear increase in computing power is required to annotate the text.",
        "Although processing power is steadily growing, it has already become impractical for a single computer to annotate a mega-corpus.",
        "Creating a large-scale annotated corpus from the web requires a way to overcome the limitations on processing power.",
        "We propose distributed techniques to alleviate the limitations on the",
        "volume of data that can be tagged by a single processor.",
        "The task of annotating the data will be shared by computers at collaborating institutions around the world, taking advantage of processing power and bandwidth that would otherwise go unused.",
        "Such large-scale parallel processing removes the workload bottleneck imposed by a server based structure.",
        "This allows for tagging a greater amount of textual data in a given amount of time while permitting other users to use the system simultaneously.",
        "Vast amounts of data can be analysed with distributed techniques.",
        "The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated by the SETI@home project2.",
        "The framework we propose can incorporate other annotation or analysis systems, for example, lemmatisation, frequency profiling, or shallow parsing.",
        "To realise and evaluate the framework, it will be developed for a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and deployed along with an existing lexicographic toolset, the Sketch Engine.",
        "A P2P approach allows for a low cost implementation that draws upon available resources (existing user PCs).",
        "As a case study for evaluation, we plan to collect a large reference corpus from the web to be hosted on servers from Lexical Computing Ltd. We can evaluate annotation speed gains of our approach comparatively against the single server version by utilising processing power in computer labs at Lancaster University and the United States Naval Academy (USNA) and we will call for volunteers from the corpus community to be involved in the evaluation as well.",
        "A key aspect of our case study research will be to investigate extending corpus collection to new document types.",
        "Most web-derived corpora have exploited raw text or HTML pages, so efforts have focussed on boilerplate removal and clean-up of these formats with tools like Hyppia-BTE, Tidy and Parcels3 (Baroni and Sharoff, 2005).",
        "Other document formats such as Adobe PDF and MS-Word have been neglected due to the extra conversion and clean-up problems they entail.",
        "By excluding PDF documents, web-derived corpora are less representative of certain genres such as academic writing."

      "text": [
        "The vast majority of previous work on corpus annotation has utilised either manual coding or automated software tagging systems, or else a semi-automatic combination of the two approaches e.g. automated tagging followed by manual correction.",
        "In most cases a standalone system or client-server approach has been taken by annotation software using batch processing techniques to tag corpora.",
        "Only a handful of web-based or email services (CLAWS4, Amalgam5, Connexor6) are available, for example, in the application of part-of-speech tags to corpora.",
        "Existing tagging systems are ‘small scale’ and typically impose some limitation to prevent overload (e.g. restricted access or document size).",
        "Larger systems to support multiple document tagging processes would require resources that cannot be realistically provided by existing single-server systems.",
        "This corpus annotation bottleneck becomes even more problematic for voluminous data sets drawn from the web.",
        "The use of the web as a corpus for teaching and research on language has been proposed a number of times (Kilgarriff, 2001; Robb, 2003; Rundell, 2000; Fletcher, 2001, 2004b) and received a special issue of the journal Computational Linguistics (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).",
        "Studies have used several different methods to mine web data.",
        "Turney (2001) extracts word co-occurrence probabilities from unlabelled text collected from a web crawler.",
        "Baroni and Bernardini (2004) built a corpus by iteratively searching Google for a small set of seed terms.",
        "Prototypes of Internet search engines for linguists, corpus linguists and lexicographers have been proposed: WebCorp (Kehoe and Renouf, 2002), KWiCFinder (Fletcher, 2004a) and the Linguist’s Search Engine (Kilgarriff, 2003; Resnik and Elkiss, 2003).",
        "A key concern in corpus linguistics and related disciplines is verifiability and replicability of the results of studies.",
        "Word frequency counts in internet search engines are inconsistent and unreliable (Veronis, 2005).",
        "Tools based on static corpora do not suffer from this problem, e.g. BNCweb7, developed at the University of Zurich, and View 8 (Variation in English Words and Phrases, developed at Brigham Young University)",
        "are both based on the British National Corpus.",
        "Both BNCweb and View enable access to annotated corpora and facilitate searching on part-of-speech tags.",
        "In addition, PIE9 (Phrases in English), developed at USNA, which performs searches on n-grams (based on words, parts-of-speech and characters), is currently restricted to the British National Corpus as well, although other static corpora are being added to its database.",
        "In contrast, little progress has been made toward annotating sizable sample corpora from the web.",
        "“Real-time” linguistic analysis of web data at the syntactic level has been piloted by the Linguist’s Search Engine (LSE).",
        "Using this tool, linguists can either perform syntactic searches via parse trees on a pre-analysed web collection of around three million sentences from the Internet Archive (www.archive.org) or build their own collections from AltaVista search engine results.",
        "The second method pushes the new collection onto a queue for the LSE annotator to analyse.",
        "A new collection does not become available for analysis until the LSE completes the annotation process, which may entail significant delay with multiple users of the LSE server.",
        "The Gsearch system (Corley et al., 2001) also selects sentences by syntactic criteria from large on-line text collections.",
        "Gsearch annotates corpora with a fast chart parser to obviate the need for corpora with preexisting syntactic mark-up.",
        "In contrast, the Sketch Engine system to assist lexicographers to construct dictionary entries requires large pre-annotated corpora.",
        "A word sketch is an automatic one-page corpus-derived summary of a word's grammatical and colloca-tional behaviour.",
        "Word Sketches were first used to prepare the Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners (2002, edited by Michael Rundell).",
        "They have also served as the starting point for high-accuracy Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "More recently, the Sketch Engine was used to develop the new edition of the Oxford Thesaurus of English (2004, edited by Maurice Waite).",
        "Parallelising or distributing processing has been suggested before.",
        "Clark and Curran’s (2004) work is in parallelising an implementation of log-linear parsing on the Wall Street Journal Corpus, whereas we focus on part-of-speech tagging of a far larger and more varied web corpus, a technique more widely considered a prerequisite for corpus linguistics research.",
        "Curran (2003)",
        "suggested distributed processing in terms of web services but only to “allow components developed by different researchers in different locations to be composed to build larger systems” and not for parallel processing.",
        "Most significantly, previous investigations have not examined three essential questions: how to apply distributed techniques to vast quantities of corpus data derived from the web, how to ensure that web-derived corpora are representative, and how to provide verifiability and replicability.",
        "These core foci of our work represent crucial innovations lacking in prior research.",
        "In particular, representativeness and replicability are key research concerns to enhance the reliability of web data for corpora.",
        "In the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational linguistics, proposals have been made for using the computational Grid for data-intensive NLP and text-mining for e-Science (Carroll et al., 2005; Hughes et al., 2004).",
        "While such an approach promises much in terms of emerging infrastructure, we wish to exploit existing computing infrastructure that is more accessible to linguists via a P2P approach.",
        "In simple terms, P2P is a technology that takes advantage of the resources and services available at the edge of the Internet (Shirky, 2001).",
        "Better known for file-sharing and Instant Messenger applications, P2P has increasingly been applied in distributed computational systems.",
        "Examples include SETI@home (looking for radio evidence of extraterrestrial life), ClimatePrediction.net (studying climate change), Predictor@home (investigating protein-related diseases) and Einstein@home (searching for gravitational signals).",
        "A key advantage of P2P systems is that they are lightweight and geared to personal computing where informal groups provide unused processing power to solve a common problem.",
        "Typically, P2P systems draw upon the resources that already exist on a network (e.g. home or work PCs), thus keeping the cost to resource ratio low.",
        "For example the fastest supercomputer cost over $110 million to develop and has a peak performance of 12.3 TFLOPS (trillions of floating-point operations per second).",
        "In contrast, a typical day for the SETI@home project involved a performance of over 20 TFLOPS, yet cost only $700,000 to develop; processing power is donated by user PCs.",
        "This high yield for low start-up cost makes it ideal for cheaply developing effective computational systems to realise, deploy and evaluate our framework.",
        "The deployment of computational based P2P systems is supported by archi",
        "tectures such as BOINC10, which provide a platform on which volunteer based distributed computing systems can be built.",
        "Lancaster's own P2P Application Framework (Walkerdine et al., submitted) also supports higher-level P2P application development and can be adapted to make use of the BOINC architecture."

        "The initial focus of the work will be to develop the framework for distributed corpus annotation.",
        "Since existing solutions have been centralised in nature, we first must examine the consequences that a distributed approach has for corpus annotation and identify issues to address.",
        "A key concern will be handling web pages within the framework, as it is essential to minimise the amount of data communicated between peers.",
        "Unlike the other distributed analytical systems mentioned above, the size of text document and analysis time is largely proportional for corpora annotation.",
        "This places limitations on work unit size and distribution strategies.",
        "In particular, three areas will be investigated:",
        "• Mechanisms for crawling/discovery of a",
        "web corpus domain - how to identify pages to include in a web corpus.",
        "Also",
        "investigate appropriate criteria for handling pages which are created or modified dynamically.",
        "• Mechanisms to generate work units for",
        "distributed computation - how to split the corpus into work units and reduce the communication / computation time ratio that is crucial for such systems to be effective.",
        "• Mechanisms to support the distribution",
        "of work units and collection of results - how to handle load balancing.",
        "What data should be sent to peers and how is the processed information handled and manipulated?",
        "What mechanisms should be in place to ensure correctness of results?",
        "How can abuse be prevented and security concerns of collaborating institutions be addressed?",
        "BOINC already provides a good platform for this, and these aspects will be investigated within the project.",
        "Analysis of existing distributed computation systems will help to inform the design of the framework and tackle some of these issues.",
        "Finally, the framework will also cater for three common strategies for corpus annotation:",
        "• Site based corpus annotation - in which the user can specify a web site to annotate • Domain based corpus annotation - in",
        "which the user specifies a content domain (with the use of keywords) to annotate",
        "• Crawler based corpus annotation - more",
        "general web based corpus annotation in which crawlers are used to locate web pages From a computational linguistic view, the framework will also need to take into account the granularity of the unit (for example, POS tagging requires sentence-units, but anaphoric annotation needs paragraphs or larger).",
        "Secondly, we need to investigate techniques for identifying identical documents, virtually identical documents and highly repetitive documents, such as those pioneered by Fletcher (2004b) and shingling techniques described by Chakrabarti (2002).",
        "The second stage of our work will involve implementing the framework within a P2P environment.",
        "We have already developed a prototype of an object-oriented application environment to support P2P system development using JXTA (Sun's P2P API).",
        "We have designed this environment so that specific application functionality",
        "can be captured within plug-ins that can then integrate with the environment and utilise its functionality.",
        "This system has been successfully tested with the development of plug-ins supporting instant messaging, distributed video encoding (Hughes and Walkerdine, 2005), distributed virtual worlds (Hughes et al., 2005) and digital library management (Walkerdine and Rayson, 2004).",
        "It is our intention to implement our distributed corpus annotation framework as a plug-in.",
        "This will involve implementing new functionality and integrating this with our existing annotation tools (such as CLAWS11).",
        "The development environment is also flexible enough to utilise the BOINC platform, and such support will be built into it.",
        "Using the P2P Application Framework as a basis for the development secures several advantages.",
        "First, it reduces development time by allowing the developer to reuse existing functionality; secondly, it already supports essential aspects such as system security; and thirdly, it has already been used successfully to deploy comparable P2P applications.",
        "A lightweight version of the application framework will be bundled with the corpus annotation plug-in, and this will then be made publicly available for download in open-source and executable formats.",
        "We envisage our end-users will come from a variety of disciplines such as language engineering and linguistics.",
