        "Machine Translation (MT) between English and Russian was one of the first translation directions tested at the dawn of MT research in the 1950s (Hutchins, 2000).",
        "Since then the MT paradigms changed many times, many systems for this language pair appeared (and disappeared), but as far as we know there was no systematic quantitative evaluation of a range of systems, analogous to DARPA?94 (White et al., 1994) and later evaluation campaigns.",
        "The Workshop on Statistical MT (WMT) in 2013 has announced a Russian evaluation track for the first time.1 However, this evaluation is currently ongoing, it should include new methods for building statistical MT (SMT) systems for Russian from the data provided in this track, but it will not cover the performance of existing systems, especially rule-based (RBMT) or hybrid ones.",
        "Evaluation campaigns play an important role in promotion of the progress for MT technologies.",
        "Recently, there have been a number of MT shared tasks for combinations of several European, Asian and Semitic languages (CallisonBurch et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Federico et al., 2012), which we took into account in designing the campaign for the English-Russian direction.",
        "The evaluation has been held in the",
        "context of ROMIP,2 which stands for Russian Information Retrieval Evaluation Seminar and is a TREC-like3 Russian initiative started in 2002.",
        "One of the main challenges in developing MT systems for Russian and for evaluating them is the need to deal with its free word order and complex morphology.",
        "Long-distance dependencies are common, and this creates problems for both RBMT and SMT systems (especially for phrase-based ones).",
        "Complex morphology also leads to considerable sparseness for word alignment in SMT.",
        "The language direction was chosen to be English?Russian, first because of the availability of native speakers for evaluation, second because the systems taking part in this evaluation are mostly used in translation of English texts for the Russian readers."

        "In designing the set of texts for evaluation, we had two issues in mind.",
        "First, it is known that the domain and genre can influence MT performance (Langlais, 2002; Babych et al., 2007), so we wanted to control the set of genres.",
        "Second, we were aiming at using sources allowing distribution of texts under a Creative Commons licence.",
        "In the end two genres were used coming from two sources.",
        "The newswire texts were collected from the English Wikinews website.",
        "The second genre was represented by ?regulations?",
        "(laws, contracts, rules, etc), which were collected from the Web using a genre classification method described in (Sharoff, 2010).",
        "The method provided a sufficient accuracy (74%) for the initial selection of texts under the category of ?regulations,?",
        "which was followed by a manual check to reject texts clearly outside of this genre category.",
        "The initial corpus consists of 8,356 original English texts that make up 148,864 sentences.",
        "We chose to retain the entire texts in the corpus rather than individual sentences, since some MT systems may use information beyond isolated sentences.",
        "100,889 sentences originated from Wikinews; 47,975 sentences came from the ?regulations?",
        "corpus.",
        "The first 1,002 sentences were published in advance to allow potential participants time to adjust their systems to the corpus format.",
        "The remaining 147,862 sentences were the corpus for testing translation into Russian.",
        "Two examples of texts in the corpus: 90237 Ambassadors from the United States of America, Australia and Britain have all met with Fijian military officers to seek insurances that there wasn't going to be a coup.",
        "102835 If you are given a discount for booking more than one person onto the same date and you later wish to transfer some of the delegates to another event, the fees will be recalculated and you will be asked to pay additional fees due as well as any administrative charge.",
        "For automatic evaluation we randomly selected 947 ?clean?",
        "sentences, i.e. those with clear sentence boundaries, no HTML markup remains, etc.",
        "(such flaws sometimes occur in corpora collected from the Web).",
        "759 sentences originated from the ?news?",
        "part of the corpus, the remaining 188 came from the ?regulations?",

        "The main idea of manual evaluation was (1) to make the assessment as simple as possible for a human judge and (2) to make the results of evaluation unambiguous.",
        "We opted for pairwise comparison of MT outputs.",
        "This is different from simultaneous ranking of several MT outputs, as commonly used in WMT evaluation campaigns.",
        "In case of a large number of participating systems each assessor ranks only a subset of MT outputs.",
        "However, a fair overall ranking cannot be always derived from such partial rankings (CallisonBurch et al., 2012).",
        "The pairwise comparisons we used can be directly converted into unambiguous overall rankings.",
        "This task is also much simpler for human judges to complete.",
        "On the other hand, pairwise comparisons require a larger number of evaluation decisions, which is feasible only for few participants (and we indeed had relatively few submissions in this campaign).",
        "Below we also discuss how to reduce the amount of human efforts for evaluation.",
        "In our case the assessors were asked to make a pairwise comparison of two sentences translated by two different MT systems against a gold standard translation.",
        "The question for them was to judge translation adequacy, i.e., which MT output conveys information from the reference translation better.",
        "The source English sentence was not presented to the assessors, because we think that we can have more trust in understanding of the source text by a professional translator.",
        "The translator also had access to the entire text, while the assessors could only see a single sentence.",
        "For human evaluation we employed the multifunctional TAUS DQF tool7 in the ?Quick Comparison?",
        "mode.",
        "Assessors?",
        "judgements resulted in rankings for each sentence in the test set.",
        "In case of ties the ranks were averaged, e.g. when the ranks of the systems in positions 2-4 and 7-8 were tied, their ranks became: 1 3 3 3 5 6 7.5 7.5.",
        "To produce the final ranking, the sentence-level ranks were averaged over all sentences.",
        "Pairwise comparisons are time-consuming: n",
        "cases require n(n?1)2 pairwise decisions.",
        "In thisstudy we also simulated a ?human-assisted?",
        "insertion sort algorithm and its variant with binary search.",
        "The idea is to run a standard sort algorithm and ask a human judge each time a comparison operation is required.",
        "This assumes that human perception of quality is transitive: if we know that A < B and B < C, we can spare evaluation of A and C. This approach also implies that sentence pairs to judge are generated and presented to assessors on the fly; each decision contributes to selection of the pairs to be judged in the next step.",
        "If the systems are presorted in a reasonable way (e.g. by an MT metric, under assumption that automatic pre-ranking is closer to the ?ideal?",
        "ranking than a random one), then we can potentially save even more pairwise comparison operations.",
        "Presorting makes ranking somewhat biased in favour of the order established by an MT metric.",
        "For example, if it favours one system against another, while in human judgement they are equal, the final ranking will preserve the initial order.",
        "Insertion sort of n sentences requires n?",
        "1 comparisons in the best case of already sorted data and n(n?1)2 inthe worst case (reversely ordered data).",
        "Insertion sort with binary search requires?",
        "n log n comparisons regardless of the initial order.",
        "For this study we ran exhaustive pairwise evaluation and used its results to simulate human-assisted sorting.",
        "In addition to human evaluation, we also ran system-level automatic evaluations using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover et al., 2009), and GTM (Turian et al., 2003).",
        "We also wanted to estimate the correlations of these metrics with human judgements for the English?Russian pair on the corpus level and on the level of individual sentences."

        "They included established groups from academia and industry, as well as new research teams.",
        "The evaluation runs also included the translations of the 947 test sentences produced by four free online systems in their default modes (referred to as OS1..OS4).",
        "For 11 runs automatic evaluation measures were calculated; eight runs underwent manual evaluation (four online systems plus four participants?",

        "14 assessors were recruited for evaluation (participating team members and volunteers); the total volume of evaluation is 10,920 pairwise sentence comparisons.",
        "Table 2 presents the rankings of the participating systems using averaged ranks from the human evaluation.",
        "There is no statistically significant difference (using Welch's t-test at p ?",
        "0.05) in the overall ranks within the following groups: (OS1, OS3, P1) < (OS2, OS4) < P5 < (P2, P4).",
        "OS3 (mostly RBMT) belongs to the troika of leaders in human evaluation contrary to the results of its automatic scores (Table 1).",
        "Similarly, P5 is consistently ranked higher than P2 by the assessors, while the automatic scores suggest the opposite.",
        "This observation confirms the well-known fact that the automatic scores underestimate RBMT systems, e.g., (B?char et al., 2012).",
        "To investigate applicability of the automatic measures to the English-Russian language direction, we computed Spearman's ?",
        "correlation between the ranks given by the evaluators and by the respective measures.",
        "Because of the amount of variation for each measure on the sentence level, robust estimates, such as the median and the trimmed mean, are more informative than the mean, since they discard the outliers (Huber, 1996).",
        "The results are listed in Table 3.",
        "All measures exhibit reasonable correlation on the corpus level (330 sentences), but the sentence-level results are less impressive.",
        "While TER and GTM are known to provide better correlation with post-editing efforts for English (O?Brien, 2011), free word order and greater data sparseness on the sentence level makes TER much less reliable for Russian.",
        "METEOR (with its built-in Russian lemma-tisation) and GTM offer the best correlation with human judgements.",
        "The lower part of Table 2 also reports the results of simulated dynamic ranking (using the NIST rankings as the initial order for the sort operation).",
        "It resulted in a slightly different final ranking of the systems since we did not account for ties and ?averaged ranks?.",
        "However, the ranking is practically the same up to the statistically significant rank differences in reference ranking (see above).",
        "The advantage is that it requires a significantly lower number of pairwise comparisons.",
        "Insertion sort yielded 5,131 comparisons (15.5 per sentence; 56% of exhaustive comparisons for 330 sentences and 8 systems); binary insertion sort yielded 4,327 comparisons (13.1 per sentence; 47% of exhaustive comparisons).",
        "Out of the original set of 330 sentences for human evaluation, 60 sentences were evaluated by two annotators (which resulted in 60*28=1680 pairwise comparisons), so we were able to calculate the standard Kohen's ?",
        "and Krippendorff's ?",
