        "In this paper, we develop a methodology for discovering the thematic structure of the Qur’an based on a fundamental idea in data mining and related disciplines: that, with respect to some collection of texts, the lexical frequency profiles of the individual texts are a good indicator of their conceptual content, and thus provide a reliable criterion for their classification relative to one another.",
        "This idea is applied to the discovery of thematic interrelationships among the suras (chapters) of the Qur’an by abstracting lexical frequency data from them and then applying hierarchical cluster analysis to that data.",
        "The results reported here indicate that the proposed methodology yields usable results in understanding the Qur’an on the basis of its lexical semantics."

        "There is a long tradition of scholarly quranic interpretation, and it has necessarily been based on traditional literary-historical methods of manual textual exegesis.",
        "However, developments in electronic text representation and analysis now offer the opportunity of applying the technologies of newly-emerging research areas such as data mining (Hand et al., 2001) to the interpretation of the Qur’an.",
        "Studies on computational analyses of the Qur’an are almost lacking.",
        "Contributions to this field include the development of a morphological analyser for the Qur’an (Dror et al., 2004).",
        "The Qur’an consists of 114 chapters called suras which range in length from the shortest, Al-Kawthar, consisting of 4 ayat (verses) to the longest, Al-Baqarah, consisting of 286 ayat.",
        "There is no obvious reason why the suras are sequenced as they are in the text.",
        "They are not in chronological order, and seem, in fact, to be ordered roughly by length, from longest at the beginning of the text to shortest at the end.",
        "Given this, apparently arbitrary sequencing, one of the first steps in interpreting the Qur’an as a whole must be to discover thematic interrelationships among the suras.",
        "The present paper proposes a methodology for doing this using exploratory multivariate analysis.",
        "The paper is in five parts; the first part is the introduction.",
        "The second presents the quranic text and the data preparation prior to the analysis.",
        "The third part deals with the application of cluster analysis techniques to the Qur’an and the interpretation of the results.",
        "The fourth part draws the conclusion and suggests future research to be undertaken."

        "Given that the lengths of the vertical lines in the above tree represent relative distance between subclusters, interpretation of the tree in terms of the constituency relations among suras is obvious: there are two main subclusters A and B; A consists of two subclusters C and D, and so on.",
        "Knowing the constituency structure of the suras is a necessary precondition for understanding their thematic interrelationships –the object of this exercise – but it is not sufficient because it provides no information about the thematic characteristics of the clusters and the thematic differences between and among them.",
        "This information can be derived from the lexical semantics of the column labels in the data matrix, as follows.",
        "Each row in the data matrix is a lexical frequency profile of the corresponding sura.",
        "Since hierarchical analysis clusters the rows of the data matrix in terms of their relative distance from one another in the data space, it follows that the lexical frequency profiles in a given cluster G are closer to one another than to any other profile in the data set.",
        "The profiles of G can be summarized by a vector s whose dimensionality is that of the data, and each of whose elements contains the mean of the frequencies for the corresponding data matrix column:",
        "where j is the index to the jth element of s, i indexes the rows of the data matrix F, and n is the total number of rows in cluster G. If s is interpreted in terms of the semantics of the matrix column labels, it becomes a thematic profile for G: relative to the frequency range of s, a high-frequency word indicates that the suras which constitute G are concerned with the denotation of that word, and the indication for a low-frequency one is the obverse.",
        "Such a thematic profile can be constructed for each subcluster, and thematic differences between subclusters can be derived by comparing the profiles.",
        "The general procedure for thematic interpretation of the cluster tree, therefore, is to work through the levels of the tree from the top, constructing and comparing thematic profiles for the subclusters at each level as far down the tree as is felt to be useful.",
        "By way of example, consider the application of this general procedure to subtrees A and B in the above cluster tree.",
        "Two mean frequency vectors were generated, one for the component suras of cluster A, and one for those of cluster B.",
        "These were then plotted relative to one another; the solid line with square nodes represents cluster A, and the dotted line with diamond nodes cluster B; for clarity, only the 50 highest-variance variables are shown, in descending order of magnitude from the left: “Figure 4.",
        "Initial plot of groups A and B” The suras of cluster A are strikingly more concerned with the denotation of variable 1, the highest-variance variable in the Qur’an, than the suras of cluster B.",

        "To gain resolution for the others, ‘Allah’ was eliminated from the lexical frequency vectors, and the vectors were re-plotted: “Figure 5.",
        "Re-plotting of groups A and B” Awareness of the historical background of the Qur’an’s revelation to Mohamed is crucial at this point of interpretation.",

        "The 13 suras which compose cluster B are all Madinan suras.",
        "The distribution of the variables (keywords) in figure 5 is also highly significant, e.g. variable 1 ‘qAl’ (said) is prevalent in the suras of cluster B.",
        "The suras of this group contain many narratives which illustrate important aspects of the quranic message, remind of the earlier prophets and their struggle and strengthen Prophet Mohamed’s message of Islam.",
        "This signifies the use of the verb ‘qAl’ as a keyword in narrative style.",
        "Variable 4 ‘qul’ (say, imperative) is more frequent in group B than group A.",
        "Most of the passages of these Makkan suras start with the word ‘qul’, which is an instruction to Prophet Mohamed to address the words following this introduction to his audience in a particular situation, such as in reply to a question that has been raised, or an assertion of a matter of belief.",
        "The use of this word was appropriate with Mohamed’s invitation to belief in God and Islam in Makkan suras.",
        "Variable 5 ‘mu/min’ (believers), variable 8 ‘Aman’ (believe) and variable 24 ‘ittaq’ (have faith) highly occur in group A.",
        "These are the Madinan suras in which prophet Mohamed addresses those who already believed in his message and hence focusing on introducing them to the other social and ethical aspects of Islam.",
        "Other variables prevelant in group B are variables 14 and 28 ‘AyAt , Ayat’ (signs/sign).",
        "The use of",
        "the two words was very important for Prophet Mohamed in the early phase of Islam in Makkah.",
        "He had to provide evidence and signs to people to support his invitation to belief in Allah and Islam.",
        "The same procedure of clustering can be applied to the subclusters of A and B.",
        "Again, the scaling of Allah’ dominates, and removing it from the mean frequency vectors gives better resolution for the remaining variables.",

        "Plot of groups C and D” Results from figure 6 are also supportive of the thematic structure of each group.",
        "Suras of group C are more abundant in the use of narratives and addressing Mohamed to provide evidence of his message to people.",
