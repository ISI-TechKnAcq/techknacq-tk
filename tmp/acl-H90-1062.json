        "It will be shown that the incorporation of inter-word units into gaining results in better acoustic models of word juncture coarticulation and gives a 20% reduction in error rate.",
        "The effect of an improved set of spectral and log energy features is to further reduce word error rate by about 30%.",

        "The resulting speech units, which we call phone-like units (PLU's) are essentially acoustic descriptions of linguistically-based units as represented in the words occurring in the given training set.",

        "The focus of this paper is to extend the basic acoustic modeling techniques developed in [1] to include modeling of word juncture coarticulation and to incorporate higher-order time derivatives of cepstral and log energy parameters into the feature vector in order to improve speech recognition performance.",
        "We tested the improved acoustic modeling techniques on speaker-independent recognition of the DARPA Naval Resource Management task using both the word-pair (WP) and the no grammar (NO) conditions.",
        "For the FEB89 test set using the WP grammar, the word accuracy improved from 91.3% to 95.0% when both the inter-word context-dependent PLU's and an improved feature analysis were incorporated into the baseline system.",
        "We also observed that, for the first time, over 70% sentence accuracy was achieved.",

        "Second, the unit separation (in terms of likelihood) distance is larger for the 1769 PLU set than that for the 1282 PLU set.",
        "The unit separation distance is measured as follows.",
        "We first collect all sets of PLU's such that all the units which have the same middle phone symbol p are grouped into the same set Sp regardless of their context and environment.",
        "We compute the distance between each pair of units in a set.",
        "The distance between units Pi and P1 is defined as the difference between average likelihoods of observing all acoustic segments with label P2 and observing all acoustic segments with label P1 given the model for unit P1.",
        "For each unit, we then define the unit separation distance as the smallest distance among all other units in the same set.",
        "When examing the histogram for the unit separation distances for the 1769 PLU set, we found a quite remarkable unit separation.",
        "Almost all the unit separation distances are larger than 2 (in log likelihood).",
        "It is also interesting to note that units appearing in the same context but in a different environment (i.e. intra-word versus inter-word) show the same behavior as units appearing in different context.",
        "The average unit separation distance is about 9.",
        "For the 1282 PLU set, the histogram plot is skewed to the left and the unit separation characteristics are not as pronounced as those of the 1769 PLU set.",
        "Results on the resource management task using the 1769 PLU set showed a significant improvement (about 10% error reduction) in performance over the 1282 PLU set using both the WP grammar and the NG grammar.",
        "We also tested the OCT89 set which consists of 300 test utterance (30 each from a group of 10 speakers), and the JUN90 set which consists of 480 test utterances (120 each from a group of two female and two male talkers).",
        "Detailed results for all three test sets using both the WP and NG cases are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 respectively.",
        "A careful examination of the word error patterns shows that function words still account for about 60% of the word errors.",
        "The second dominant category, which accounts for more than 20% of the errors, are confusions involving the same root word (e.g. location versus locations, six versus sixth, Flint versus Flint's, chop versus chopped, etc.)",
        "appearing in different forms.",
        "This type of errors can easily be corrected with a simple set of syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "infrequently in the training data.",
        "We are now experimenting with a unit expansion rule, which uses the unit reduction rule first (based on a lower count threshold) to get a set of auxiliary speech units which are the units to be expanded into a complete set.",
        "The only remaining issue is how to predict the model for units in the auxiliary set.",
        "For each existing model, we compute the likelihood of observing all the acoustic segments corresponding to each auxiliary unit.",
        "Then we assign the model that is the closest to each of the auxiliary speech units.",
        "The effectiveness of such an approach is yet to be evaluated.",
        "It is interesting to note that for the speaker-independent part of the evaluation data, we achieved virtually the same level of performance, 95.5% word accuracy and over 70% sentence accuracy, for both the FEB89 and OCT89 test data.",
        "However, for the JUN90 test set, the word accuracy fell to 94.9%.",
        "The sentence accuracy of 70.2% was also considerably lower than that for the FEB89 and OCT89 test sets.",
        "This was due to the fact that one of the female test talkers (jrm08) gave a very poor result, namely 90.8% word accuracy.",
        "The median word accuracy among all four JUN90 test talkers was over 95.5%.",
        "Another possible explanation for this performance degradation is that the speaker-dependent part of the test utterances was generated from a set of sentence patterns whose context was significantly different from the set of sentences used to generate the 109-speaker training set.",
        "This brings up the issue of the adequacy of training data.",
        "The above discussion suggests that a task-specific training set is more useful than a task-independent training set.",
        "This agrees somewhat with results reported in [14], where the so called \"vocabulary-independent\" training procedure is effective only when most of the task-specific triphone contexts appear in the training corpus.",
        "Even though only a small improvement in performance was obtained in our test, we believe the real benefit of incorporating position-dependent PLU modeling lies in the area of model prediction for units appearing rather"

        "We have reported on several improvements to one of the speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition systems developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.",
        "The improved acoustic modeling, including incorporation of inter-word units and an improved feature analysis, provided high word accuracies for all three DARPA evaluation sets using the word pair grammar.",
        "We have also developed a unit selection rule for selecting intra-word and inter-word units independently.",
        "We anticipate that with the proposed unit expansion rule, an even better set of units can be obtained which will further improve acoustic modeling techniques for continuous speech recognition.",
        "Based on current recognition performance it seems fair to say that when task-specific training data are provided for acoustic modeling of the set of basic speech units using HMM's, high performance can be achieved for a large vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition task with a perplexity of about 60.",
        "However, there are still some open issues that need to be addressed.",
        "The reader is referred to a recent paper [15] for a discussion of some of those issues related to using HMM's for speech recognition.",
        "We list, in the following, a number of acoustic modeling issues which we believe to be essential for expanding the capabilities of our current continuous speech recognition system.",
        "They are: (1) Speech unit selection and modeling for task-independent applications; (2) Improved word discrimination based on some form of corrective training for continuous density HMM parameters (e.g. [16]); (3) Lexical modeling to deal with lexical variability in baseform pronunciation; and (4) Improved feature selection so that only those features useful to discrimination are included in the feature vector.",
        "Our tasks so far have been mainly focused on speech recognition.",
        "We observed that short function words (e.g. \"a\", \"the\") are a major source of recognition errors.",
        "However, most of those errors can be corrected using a set of simple syntactic and semantic rules operating in a",
        "post-processing mode.",
        "For example, for the resource management task, we have developed a language decoder (decoupled from the acoustic decoder) that incorporates a set of simple rules.",
        "Our preliminary results [17] indicate that sentence accuracy for the FEB89 test set improved from 70% to close to 90% (with 98% word accuracy) when the top candidate string decoded using the word-pair grammar is used as input to this language decoder.",
        "When no grammatical constraints were used in speech decoding, the sentence accuracy improved from 24% to 67% (with 90% word accuracy).",
        "Except in cases where some key content words were misrecognized, the simple language analyzer properly decoded the noisy strings provided by the speech decoder without going back to the acoustic domain to request mismatch information.",
        "We believe the language decoder can be more effective if the speech decoder can provide more word and string hypotheses.",
        "One way to get more information is to use the N-best string search strategies.",
        "Another way is to construct, in acoustic decoding, a phone lattice and a word lattice that contain more word hypotheses, and then generate recognized strings according to the language constraints.",
        "The effectiveness of such approaches in real spoken language tasks, such as the DARPA Air Travel Information System (ATIS) task, is yet to be evaluated."
