        "Traditionally, Information Retrieval (IR) and Statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have been based on the “bag of words” model.",
        "This model assumes term independence and homogeneity of the text and document under consideration, i.e. the terms in a document are all assumed to be distributed homogeneously.",
        "This immediately leads to the Vector Space representation of text.",
        "The immense popularity of this model is due to the ease with which mathematical and statistical techniques can be applied to it.",
        "The model assumes that once a term occurs in a document, its overall frequency in the entire document is the only useful measure that associates a term with a document.",
        "It does not take into consideration whether the term occurred in the beginning, middle or end of the document.",
        "Neither does it consider whether the term occurs many times in close succession or whether it occurs uniformly throughout the document.",
        "It also assumes that additional positional information does not provide any extra leverage to the performance of the NLP and IR applications based on it.",
        "This assumption has been shown to be wrong in certain applications (Franz, 1997).",
        "Existing models for term distribution are based on the above assumption, so they can merely estimate the term’s frequency in a document or a term’s topical behavior for a content term.",
        "The occurrence of a content word is classified as topical or non-topical based on whether it occurs once or many times in the document (Katz, 1996).",
        "We are not aware of any existing model that makes less stringent assumptions and models the distribution of occurrences of a term.",
        "In this paper we describe a model for term re-occurrence in text based on the gaps between successive occurrences of the term and the position of its first occurrence in a document.",
        "The gaps are modeled by a mixture of exponential distributions.",
        "Non-occurrence of a term in a document is modeled by the statistical concept of censoring, which states that the event of observing a certain term is censored at the end of the document, i.e. the document length.",
        "The modeling is done in a Bayesian framework.",
