        "But for obtaining the partial labeled data with lexicon, the matching method can still be a solution.",
        "Since we do not aim to recognize every word from sentence, we can select a lexicon with smaller coverage but less ambiguity to achieve relatively precise matching result.",
        "In this paper, we apply two matching schemes to the same raw sentences to obtain partially annotated sentences.",
        "The first is a simple forward-maximum matching (FMM) scheme, which is very close to the forward maximum matching algorithm ofWu and Tseng (1993) for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "This scheme scans the input sentence from left to right.",
        "At each position, it attempts to find the longest subsequence of Chinese characters that matches a lexicon entry.",
        "If such an entry is found, the subsequence is tagged with the corresponding tags, and its surrounding characters are also constrained to a smaller set of tags.",
        "If no subsequence is found in the lexicon, the character is left with all the possible tags.",
        "Taking the sentence in Figure 2a for example.",
        "When the algorithm scans the second character, ??",
        "?, and finds the entry ?????",
        "in the lexicon, the subsequence of characters is recognized as a word, and tagged with b, m and e, respectively.",
        "At the same time, the previous character ???",
        "can be inferred as only end of a multi-character word (e) or a single-character word (s).",
        "The second matching scheme is backward maximum matching, which can be treated as the application of FMM on the reverse of unlabeled sentences using a lexicon of reversed words.",
        "To mitigate the errors resulting from one single matching scheme, we combine the two matching results by agreement.",
        "The basic idea is that if a subsequence of sentence is recognized as word by multiple matching results, it can be considered as a more precise annotation.",
        "Our algorithm reads partial segmentation by different methods and selects the subsequences that are identified as word by all methods as annotated words.",
        "2.2 Natural Annotation We use the Chinese Wikipedia for natural annotation.",
        "Partially annotated sentences are readily formed in Wikipedia by markup syntax, such as URLs.",
        "However, some subtle issues exist if the sentences are used directly.",
        "One problem is incompatibility of segmentation standards between the annotated training data and Wikipedia.",
        "Jiang et al. (2009) discuss this incompatibility problem between two corpora ?",
        "the CTB and the Peo-ple's Daily; the problem is even more severe on Wikipedia because it can be edited by any user.",
        "Table 1a shows a case of incompatible annotation between the People's Daily data and natural annotation in Wikipedia, where the three characters ?????",
        "are segmented differently.",
        "Both can be treated as correct, although they have different segmentation granularities.",
        "Another problem is the intrinsic ambiguity of segmentation.",
        "The same character sequence can be segmented into different words under different contexts.",
        "If the training and test data contain different contexts, the learned model can give incorrect results on the test data.",
        "This is particularly true across different domains.",
        "Table 1b gives such an example, where the character sequence ????",
        "is segmented differently in two of our test domains, but both cases exist in Wikipedia.",
        "In summary, Wikipedia introduces both useful information for domain adaptation and harmful noise with negative effects on the model.",
        "To 866 achieve better performance of domain adaptation using Wikipedia, one intuitive approach is to select more domain-related data and less irrelevant data to minimize the risks that result from incompatible annotation and domain difference.",
        "To this end, we assume that there are some raw sentences on the target domain, which can be used to evaluate the relevance between Wikipedia and target domain test data.",
        "We assume that URL-tagged entries reflect the segmentation standards of Wikipedia sentence, and use them to match Wikipedia sentences with the raw target domain data.",
        "If the character sequence of any URL-tagged entry in a Wikipedia sentence matches the target domain data, the Wikipedia sentence is selected for training.",
        "Another advantage of such data selection is that the training time consumption can be reduced by reducing the size of training data.",
