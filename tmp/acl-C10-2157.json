        "When learning a second language, students make mistakes along the way.",
        "While some mistakes are idiosyncratic and individual, many are systematic and common to people who share the same primary language.",
        "There has been extensive research on grammar error detection.",
        "Most previous efforts focus on identifying specific types of problems commonly encountered by English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.",
        "Some examples include the proper usage of determiners (Yi et al., 2008; Gamon et al., 2008), prepositions (Chodorow et al., 2007; Gamon et al., 2008; Hermet et al., 2008), and mass versus count nouns (Nagata et al., 2006).",
        "However, previous work suggests that grammar error correction is considerably more challenging than detection (Han et al., 2010).",
        "Furthermore, an ESL learner's writing may contain multiple interacting errors that are difficult to detect and correct in isolation.",
        "A promising research direction is to tackle automatic grammar error correction as a machine translation (MT) problem.",
        "The dis-fluent sentences produced by an ESL learner can be seen as the input source language, and the corrected revision is the result of the translation.",
        "Brockett et al.",
        "(2006) showed that phrase-based statistical MT can help to correct mistakes made on mass nouns.",
        "To our knowledge, phrase-based MT techniques have not been applied for rewriting entire sentences.",
        "One major challenge is the lack of appropriate training data such as a sizable parallel corpus.",
        "Another concern is that phrase-based MT may not be similar enough to the problem of correcting ESL learner mistakes.",
        "While MT rewrites an entire source sentence into the target language, not every word written by an ESL learner needs to be modified.",
        "Another alternative that may afford a more general model of ESL error corrections is to consider syntax-driven MT approaches.",
        "We argue that syntax-based approaches can overcome the expected challenges in applying MT to this domain.",
        "First, it can be less dataintensive because the mapping is formed at a structural level rather than the surface word level.",
        "While it does require a robust parser, a syntax-driven MT model may not need to train on a very large parallel corpus.",
        "Second, syntactic transformations provide an intuitive description of how second language learners revise their writings: they are transforming structures in their primary language to those in the new language.",
        "In this paper, we conduct a first inquiry into the applicability of syntax-driven MT methods to automatic grammar error correction.",
        "In particular, we investigate whether a syntax-driven model can capture ESL students' process of writing revisions.",
        "We compare two approaches: a tree-to-string mapping proposed by Yamada & Knight (2001) and a tree-to-tree mapping using the Quasi-Synchronous",
        "Grammar (QG) formalism (Smith and Eisner, 2006).",
        "We train both models on a parallel corpus consisting of multiple drafts of essays by ESL students.",
        "The approaches are evaluated on how well they model the revision pairs in an unseen test corpus.",
        "Experimental results suggest that 1) the QG model has more flexibility and is able to describe more types of transformations; but 2) the YK model is better at capturing the incremental improvements in the ESL learners' revision writing process."

        "This paper explores the research question: can ESL learners' process of revising their writings be described by a computational model?",
        "A successful model of the revision process has several potential applications.",
        "In addition to automatic grammar error detection and correction, it may also be useful as an automatic metric in an intelligent tutoring system to evaluate how well the students are learning to make their own revisions.",
        "Revising an ESL student's writing bears some resemblance to translating.",
        "The student's first draft is likely to contain disfluent expressions that arose from translation divergences between English and the student's primary language.",
        "In the revised draft, the divergences should be resolved so that the text becomes fluent English.",
        "We investigate to what extent are formalisms used for machine translation applicable to model writing revision.",
        "We hypothesize that ESL students typically modify sentences to make them sound more fluent rather than to drastically change the meanings of what they are trying to convey.",
        "Thus, our work focuses on syntax-driven MT models.",
        "One challenge of applying MT methods to model grammar error correction is the lack of appropriate training data.",
        "The equivalence to the bilingual parallel corpus used for developing MT systems would be a corpus in which each student sentence is paired with a fluent version rewritten by an instructor.",
        "Unlike bilingual text, however, there is not much data of this type in practice because there are typically too many students for the teachers to provide detailed manual inspection and correction at a large scale.",
        "More commonly, students are asked to revise their previously written essays as they learn more about the English language.",
        "Here is an example of a student sentence from a first-draft essay:",
        "The problem here is that they come to the US like illegal.",
        "In a later draft, it has been revised into:",
        "The problem here is that they come to the US illegally.",
        "Although the students are not able to create \"gold standard revisions\" due to their still imperfect understanding of English, a corpus that pairs the students' earlier and later drafts still offers us an opportunity to model how ESL speakers make mistakes.",
        "More formally, the corpus C consists of a set of sentence pairs (O,R), where O represents the student's original draft and R represents the revised draft.",
        "Note that while R is assumed to be an improvement upon O, its quality may fall short of the gold standard revision, G. To train the syntax-driven MT models, we optimize the joint probability of observing the sentence pair, Pr(O,R), through some form of mapping between their parse trees, t0 and tr.",
        "An added wrinkle to our problem is that it might not always be possible to assign a sensible syntactic structure to an ungrammatical sentence.",
        "It is well-known that an English parser trained on the Penn Treebank is bad at handling disfluent sentences (Charniak et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2008).",
        "In our domain, since O (and perhaps also R) might be disflu-ent, an important question that a translation model must address is: how should the mapping between the trees t0 and tr be handled?"

        "Our goal is to assess which formalism is a better fit with the domain of essay revision modeling, in which the data largely consist of imperfect sentences that may not support a plausible syntactic interpretation.",
        "The Yamada & Knight (henceforth, YK) tree-to-string model is an instance of noisy channel translation systems, which assumes that the observed source sentence is the result of transformation performed on the parse tree of the intended target sentence due to a noisy communication channel.",
        "Given a parallel corpus, and a parser for the the target side, the parameters of this model can be estimated using EM(Expectation Maximization).",
        "The trained model's job is to recover the target sentence (and tree) through decoding.",
        "While the noisy channel generation story may sound somewhat counter-intuitive for translation, it gives a plausible account of ESL learner's writing process.",
        "The student really wants to convey a fluent English sentence with a well-formed structure, but due to an imperfect understanding of the language, writes down an ungrammatical sentence, O, as a first draft.",
        "The student serves as the noisy channel.",
        "The YK model describes this as a stochastic process that performs three operations on tg, the parse of the intended sentence, G:",
        "1.",
        "Each node in tg may have its children reordered with some probability.",
        "2.",
        "Each node in tg may have a child node inserted to its left or right with some probability.",
        "3.",
        "Each leaf node (i.e., surface word) in tgis replaced by some (possibly empty) string according to its lexical translation distribution.",
        "The resulting sentence, O, is the concatenation of the leaf nodes of the transformed tg.",
        "Common mistakes made by ESL learners, such as misuses of determiners and prepositions, word choice errors, and incorrect constituency orderings, can be modeled by a combination of the insert, replace, and reorder operators.",
        "The YK model allows us to perform transformations on a higher syntactic level.",
        "Another potential benefit is that the model does not attempt to assign syntactic interpretations over the source sentences (i.e., the less fluent original draft).",
        "The Quasi-Synchronous Grammar formalism (Smith and Eisner, 2006) is a generative model that aims to produce the most likely target tree for a given source tree.",
        "It differs from the more strict synchronous grammar formalisms (Wu, 1995; Melamed et al., 2004) because it does not try to perform simultaneous parsing on parallel grammars; instead, the model learns an augmented target-language grammar whose rules make \"soft alignments\" with a given source tree.",
        "QG has been applied to some NLP tasks other than MT, including answer selection for question-answering (Wang et al., 2007), paraphrase identification (Das and Smith, 2009), and parser adaptation and projection (Smith and Eisner, 2009).",
        "In this work we use an instantiation of QG that largely follows the model described by Smith and Eisner (2006).",
        "The model is trained on a parallel corpus in which both the first-draft and revised sentences have been parsed.",
        "Using EM to estimate its parameters, it learns an augmented target PCFG grammar whose production rules form associations with the given source trees.",
        "Consider the scenario in Figure 1.",

        "Thus, assuming that the target symbol A has already been aligned to source node a from an earlier derivation step, the likelihood of expanding (a, A) with the above production rule depends on three factors:",
        "1. the likelihood of the monolingual target rule, Pr(A â€“ BC)",
        "2. the likelihood of alignments between B and ÃŸ as well as C and 7.",
        "3. the likelihood that the source nodes form some expected configuration (i.e., between a and ÃŸ as well as between a and 7).",
        "In this work, we distinguish between two configuration types: parent-child and other.",
        "This restriction doesn't reduce the explanatory power of the resulting QG model, though it may not be as fine-tuned as some models in (Smith and Eisner, 2006).",
        "Under QG, the ESL students' first drafts are seen as text in a different language that has its own syntactic constructions.",
        "QG explains the grammar rules that govern the revised text in terms of how different components map to structures in the original draft.",
        "It makes explicit the representation of divergences between the students' original mental model and the expected structure.",
        "Cross entropy can be used as a metric that measures the distance between the learned probabilistic model and the real data.",
        "It can be interpreted as measuring the amount of information that is needed in addition to the model to accurately recover the observed data.",
        "In language modeling, cross entropy is widely used in showing a given model's prediction power.",
        "To determine how well the two syntax-driven MT models capture the ESL student revision generation process, we measure the cross entropy of each trained model on an unseen test corpus.",
        "This quantity measures how surprised a model is about relating an initial sentence, O, to its corresponding revision, R. Specifically, the cross entropy for some model M on a test corpus C of original and revised sentence pairs (O, R) is:",

        "Typically, the changes between the drafts are incremental.",
        "Approximately half of the sentences are not changed at all.",

        "We uniformly initialized the configuration parameters; the parent-child configuration and other configuration each has 0.5 probability.",

        "There may be better initialization setups, but the difference between those setups will become small after a few rounds of EM.",
        "Once trained, the two models compute the joint probability of every sentence pair in the test corpus as described in Section 3.3.",
        "To evaluate how well the models describe the ESL revision domain, we want to see which model is less \"surprised\" by the test data.",
        "We expected that the better model should be able to transform more sentence pair in the test corpus; we also expect that the better model should have a lower cross entropy with respect to the test corpus.",
        "Applying both YK and QG to the test corpus, we find that neither model is able to transform all the test sentence pairs.",
        "Of the two, QG had the better coverage; it successfully modeled 59 pairs out of 100 (we denote this subset as Dqg).",
        "In contrast, YK modeled 36 pairs (this subset is denoted as Dyk).",

        "For the edit distance difference, we applied hypothesis testing with the null-hypothesis that \"longer sentence pairs are as likely to be covered by our model as shorter ones.\"",
        "Second, both models sometimes have trouble with sentence pairs that require no change.",
        "This may be due to out-of-vocabulary words in the test corpus.",
        "A more aggressive smoothing strategy could improve the coverage for both models.",
        "Third, comparing the subset of sentence pairs that only QG could transform (Dqg â€“ Dyk) against the subset of sentences that both models could transform (Dqg H Dyk), the former has slightly higher average edit distance and length, but the difference is not statistically significant.",
        "Although QG could transform more sentence pairs, the cross entropy of Dqg â€“ Dyk is higher than QG's estimate for the Dqg H Dyk subset.",
        "QG's soft alignment property allows it to model more complex transformations with greater flexibility.",
        "Finally, while the YK model has a more limited coverage, it models those transformations with a greater certainty.",
        "For the common subset of sentence pairs that both models could transform, YK has a much lower cross entropy than QG.",
        "Table 3 further breaks down the common subset.",
        "It is not surprising that both models have low entropy for identical sentence pairs.",
        "For modeling sentence pairs that contain revisions, YK is more efficient than QG.",

        "Some relevant statistics on the sentence subsets are also summarized in the table.",
        "Table 3: A further comparison of the two models on Dqg n Dyk , the sentence pairs in the test corpus that both could transform.",
        "The results of the previous experiment raises the possibility that QG might have a greater coverage because it is too flexible.",
        "However, an appropriate model should not only assign large probability mass to positive examples, but it should also have a low chance of choosing negative examples.",
        "In this next experiment, we construct a \"negative\" test corpus to see how it affects the models.",
        "To construct a negative scenario, we still use the same test corpus as before, but we reverse the sentence pairs.",
        "That is, we use the revised sentences as \"originals\" and the original sentences as \"revisions.\"",
        "We would expect a good model to have a raised cross entropy values along with a drop in coverage on the new dataset because the \"revisions\" should be more disfluent than the \"original\" sentences.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the results.",
        "We observe that the number of instances that can be transformed has dropped for both models: from 59 to 49 pairs for QG, and from 36 to 20 pairs for YK; also, the proportion of identical instances in each set has raised.",
        "This means that both models are more surprised by the reverse test corpus, suggesting that both models have, to some extent, succeeded in modeling the ESL revision domain.",
        "However, QG still allows for many more transformations.",
        "Moreover, 16 out of the 49 instances are non-identical pairs.",
        "In contrast, YK modeled only 1 non-identical sentence pair.",
        "The results from these two experiments suggest that YK is more suited for modeling the ESL revision domain than QG.",
        "One possible explanation is that QG allows more flexibility and would require more training.",
        "Another possible explanation is that because YK assumes well-formed syntax structure for only the target side, the philosophy behind its design is a better fit with the ESL revision problem."

        "This paper investigates the suitability of syntax-driven MT approaches for modeling the revision writing process of ESL learners.",
        "We have considered both the Yamada & Knight tree-to-string model, which only considers syntactic information from the typically more fluent revised text, as well as Quasi-Synchronous Grammar, a tree-to-tree model that attempts to learn syntactic transformation patterns between the students' original and revised texts.",
        "Our results suggests that while QG offers a greater degree of freedom, thus allowing for a better coverage of the transformations, YK has a lower entropy on the test corpus.",
        "Moreover, when presented with an alternative \"trick\" corpus in which the \"revision\" is in fact the earlier draft, YK was more perplexed than QG.",
        "These results suggest that the YK model may be a promising approach for automatic grammar error correction."
