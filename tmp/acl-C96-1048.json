        "In order to give a correct interpretation of the cross-sentential anaphora, one has to be able to refer back to an antecedent, which is to be found in a preceding sentence, and I am using the term information-passing exactly in this sense: some information about a possible antecedent must be stored in order to be passed on to following sentences and to allow the anaphoric link, if some of the subsequent sentences are containing an anaphoric pronoun.",
        "Using the simple unification technique, as for the processing of other linguistic phenomena within ALEP, a resolution of the pronoun can then be tried out: parts of the content information of the pronoun are going to be compared (unified) with specific parts of the content information of the (possible) antecedent.",
        "In the next section I will first show how larger linguistic units can be processed within the ALEP system.",

        "In the last section I will show how a very preliminary and tentative implementation of this framework can be modelled within the ALEP formalism.",

        "This approach is concerned among other things with the cross-sentential anaphora.",
        "The dynamic aspect resides in the fact that, for this approach, the meaning of a sentence doesn't lie in its truth conditions, but \"rather in the way it changes the ... information of the interpreter\"4 DPI, considers only the information change which concerns \"their potential to `pass-on' possible antecedents for subsequent anaphors\"5.",
        "The Dynamic",
        "Predicate Logic is based on the syntax of the standard predicate logic, but proposes a new (dynamic) interpretation of the quantifiers and connectives which allows the binding of variables within and outside their scope, depending on the interpretation of the corresponding expressions of the natural language.",
        "Two (strong) assumptions, which are controversial in the discussion on this topic, are underlying the DPL approach: Indefinite NPs are considered to be quantificational expressions and pronouns to act like variables.",
        "Not everyone agrees on those assumptions, as this can be seen in the Discourse Representation Theory or in the work by Irene Heim°.",
        "But those assumptions are here important if one wants to provide an uniform translation of indefinite NPs into existential quantifier (see below).",
        "And the desired compositional treatments requires that the information concerning the pronouns is to be found in the sentences uttered so far, i.e. as included within the scope of a logical quantifier or connective.",
        "The particular expressions of the natural language DPL is dealing with are the following:",
        "(1) A man walks in the park.",
        "He whistles.",
        " – cross-sentential anaphora (2) If a farmer owns a donkey, lie beats it.",
        " – donkey sentence (3) Every farmer who owns a donkey, beats it.",
        "donkey sentence And the problem consists in providing an adequate semantic representation of the anaphoric links.",
        "There are several ways of representing the semantic interpretation of each of the utterances and three of them (1 - 3) are discussed by Groe-nendijk & Stokhof: (A) In classical predicate logic: - ]x[man(x)Awalk _in_the_park(x)Awhistle(x)] (1) - V xVy[[f rmer (x) A donkey(y) A own(x, 0] beat(x, y)] (2) & (3) (B) In a compositional way: - x[man(x)Awalk _in_the_park(x)]Awhistle(x) (1) ]x[f armer(x) A y[donkey(y) A own(x, y)]] beat(x, y) (2) - V x[[f armer(x) A .y[donkey(y) A own(x, y)]] beat(x, y)] (3) (C) In the Discourse Representation Theory: - [x][man(x), wall e _in_the_park(x), whistle(x)] (1) [[x, [farmer(x), donkey(y), own(x, y)] – + H[beat(x, y)]] (2) & (3)",
        "What is missing in (A) is the compositional representation of the subparts of the utterances.",
        "Another disturbing point is the distinct translation of the 'See (Kamp 1981) and (Heim 1982, p. 122) indefinite NPs into the representational language, once as an existential quantifier (A,1) and once as an universal quantifier (A,2 & A,3).",
        "The fact that (2) and (3) translate into the same semantic representation is also reflecting the non-compositionality of the classical predicate logic in this case.",
        "The problems with the compositional representation (B) are concerning the binding of the variables (the pronouns in the natural language).",
        "In (B,1) the third occurence of the variable x is free and thus doesn't allow the anaphoric reading.",
        "The same remarks are valid for x and y in (B,2) and for y in (B,3).",
        "But the way (B) is representating the utterances allows the uniform translation of indefinite NPs into an existential quantifier.",
        "The problems with the DRT representation are more of methodological nature, since on the treatment of those cases, DPL and DRT are empirically equivalent.",
        "In short: Groenendijk and Stokhof are missing the compositional building of the semantic representation and also would prefer to use a more classical representational language, like the one of first order logic.",
        "For this, they are 'merging' together the representation (A) and (B), and considering now only the first case (1), the dynamic semantic interpretation is going to be like (B,1):",
        "but with the existential quantifier having scope over the conjunction of the two sentences, this representation is going to be equivalent to: ix[man(x) A walk _in_the_park(x) A whistle(x)].",
        "This is possible because the interpretation of a sentence doesn't lie in a set of assignments, but rather in a set of ordered pairs of assignments, where those pairs represent the input-output states of a sentence.",
        "In our example, the first sentence has an output which is as the same time the input of the second one.",
        "Since the existential quantifier is interpreted as being able to quantify outside its scope (also in combination with the conjunction and the sequencing of sentences), the information concerning the (possible) antecedent is going to be passed-on to following sentences, which could be subsequently uttered.",
        "The fact that the existential quantifier in DPL is interpreted as a quantifier which can bind outside of its syntactic scope allows to say that we provide a compositional treatment of the utterance, the second sentence being interpreted as it comes, without referring to some metalinguistical representation or process.",
        "The existential quantifier is qualified as an externally dynamic quantifier.",
        "Not every quantifier (or connective) has the dynamic property of binding outside of its scope; the universal quantifier, for example, can bind within its scope, but not outside of it:",

        "is ruled out.",
        "The dynamic semantic interpretation of this quantifier blocks the passing of the information: the ouptut of the first sentence is empty (with respect to the information concerning anaphoric binding).",
        "The input of the following sentence will therefore contain no information allowing a resolution of the pronoun.",
        "The way DPL is interpretating the distinct quantifiers and connectives is the following one:",
        "• Existential quantification and conjunction are externally dynamic.",
        "They can bind variables within and outside their scope: [A inan]i walks in the park and hei whistles.",
        "Hei is happy • Universal quantification and implication are internally dynamic.",
        "They can bind variables only inside their scope: Every farmer who owns [a donkey]i, beats * [Every man];, walks in the park.",

        "Hei whistles * [A man]i walks in the park or hei whistles This is too simple and for some English examples it seems to be wrong.",
        "The authors are considering and discussing the cases which contradict the assumptions and give sonic hints in order to integrate those cases.",
        "I will not discuss this point here, but just mention, that for the German grammar we should have a look at a detained analysis of the meaning of such expressions7.",
        "Once this has been done, we can encode this information in the lexicon (as will be seen in the next section).",
        "But here we can say that the DPL approach allows us, to a certain degree, to account for the resolution of anaphora without having to leave the field of linguistic descriptions.",
        "With the only means of the grammar and the formalism we have, we are able to provide a first and simple description of those phenomena.",
