        "The fast development of Social Media made it possible for people to no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content.",
        "This phenomenon is of high importance to news monitoring systems, whose aim is to obtain an informative snapshot of media events and related comments.",
        "This paper presents the strategies employed in the OPTWIMA participation to SemEval 2013 Task 2-Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.",
        "The main goal was to evaluate the best settings for a sentiment analysis component to be added to the online news monitoring system.",
        "We describe the approaches used in the competition and the additional experiments performed combining different datasets for training, using or not slang replacement and generalizing sentiment-bearing terms by replacing them with unique labels.",
        "The results regarding tweet classification are promising and show that sentiment generalization can be an effective approach for tweets and that SMS language is difficult to tackle, even when specific normalization resources are employed."

        "Sentiment analysis is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) task dealing with the detection and classification of sentiments in texts.",
        "Usually, the classes considered are ?positive?, ?negative?",
        "and ?neutral?, although in some cases finer-grained categories are added (e.g. ?very positive?",
        "and ?very negative?)",
        "or only the ?positive?",
        "and ?negative?",
        "classes are taken into account.",
        "This task has received a lot of interest from the research community in the past years.",
        "The work done regarded the manner in which sentiment can be classified from texts pertaining to different genres and distinct languages, in the context of various applications, using knowledge-based, semi-supervised and supervised methods [Pang and Lee, 2008].",
        "The result of the analyses performed have shown that the different types of text require specialized methods for sentiment analysis, as, for example, sentiments are not conveyed in the same manner in newspaper articles and in blogs, reviews, forums or other types of user-generated contents [Balahur et al., 2010].",
        "In the light of these findings, dealing with sentiment analysis in tweets and SMS (that we can generally call ?short informal texts?)",
        "requires an analysis of the characteristics of such texts and the design of adapted methods.",
        "Our participation in the SemEval 2013 Task 2 [Wilson et al., 2013] had as objective to test how well our proposed methods for sentiment analysis for short informal texts (especially tweets) would perform.",
        "The two subtasks proposed in this competition were: a) the classification of sentiment from snippets from tweets and SMS marked as start and end position and b) the classification of sentiment from entire tweets and SMS.",
        "Each team could submit 2 runs for each dataset and task, one employing as training data only the data provided within the competition (?constrained?)",
        "and the second em",
        "ploying any additional data (?unconstrained?).",
        "We submitted 2 of such runs for each of the subtasks and datasets.",
        "The main requirements for the system we implemented were: a) not to use language-specific NLP processing tools (since our final goal is to make the present system work for many more languages); and b) to work fast, so that it can be integrated in a near real time media monitoring system."

        "Their preprocessing stage includes the removal of retweets, translation of abbreviations into original terms and deleting of links, a tokenization process, and part-of-speech tagging.",

        "They add information on the context of the tweet to its text (e.g. the event that it is related to).",
        "Subsequently, they employ SVM and General Inquirer and perform a three-way classification (positive, negative, neutral).",
        "The main contributions of the approaches considered for the competition reside in the evaluation of different strategies to adapt sentiment analysis methods to the language employed in short informal texts.",
        "The methods employed in our system are simple, work fast and efficient and can be easily adapted to other languages.",
        "The main adaptations we consider are part of a preprocessing step, in which the language in these short informal texts is normalized (brought to a dictionary form).",
        "Finally, the methods presented are compared on different configurations and training sets, so that the conclusions drawn are relevant to the phenomena found in this type of informal texts."
