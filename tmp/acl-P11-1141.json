      "heading": "1. Why Parse Word Structures?",
      "text": [
        "Research in Chinese word segmentation has progressed tremendously in recent years, with state of the art performing at around 97% in precision and recall (Xue, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Li and Sun, 2009).",
        "However, virtually all these systems focus exclusively on recognizing the word boundaries, giving no consideration to the internal structures of many words.",
        "Though it has been the standard practice for many years, we argue that this paradigm is inadequate both in theory and in practice, for at least the following four reasons.",
        "The first reason is that if we confine our definition of word segmentation to the identification of word boundaries, then people tend to have divergent opinions as to whether a linguistic unit is a word or not (Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "This has led to many different annotation standards for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Even worse, this could cause inconsistency in the same corpus.",
        "For instance, ©\\ IÈ )$> 'vice president' is considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), but is split into two words by the Peking University corpus in the SIGHAN Bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).",
        "Meanwhile, ©\\ ^ 'vice director' and ©\\ irïl 'deputy manager' are both segmented into two words in the same Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "In fact, all these words are composed of the prefix © 'vice' and a root word.",
        "Thus the structure of S!jzË)$> 'vice president' can be represented with the tree in Figure 1.",
        "Without a doubt, there is complete agreement on the correctness of this structure among native Chinese speakers.",
        "So if instead of annotating only word boundaries, we annotate the structures of every word, then the annotation tends to be more consistent and there could be less duplication of efforts in developing the expensive annotated corpus.",
        "The second reason is applications have different requirements for granularity of words.",
        "Take the personal name M W À 'Zhou Shuren' as an example.",
        "It's considered to be one word in the Penn Chinese Treebank, but is segmented into a surname and a given name in the Peking University corpus.",
        "For some applications such as information extraction, the former segmentation is adequate, while for others like machine translation, the later finer-grained output is more preferable.",
        "If the analyzer can produce a structure as shown in Figure 4(a), then every application can extract what it needs from this tree.",
        "A solution with tree output like this is more elegant than approaches which try to meet the needs of different applications in post-processing (Gao et al., 2004).",
        "The third reason is that traditional word segmentation has problems in handling many phenomena in Chinese.",
        "For example, the telescopic compound ^pfvj^ 'universities, middle schools and primary schools' is in fact composed of three coordinating elements A^ 'university', 'middle school' and 'primary school'.",
        "Regarding it as one flat word loses this important information.",
        "Another example is separable words like WW 'swim'.",
        "With a linear segmentation, the meaning of 'swimming' as in W tu W 'after swimming' cannot be properly represented, since WW 'swim' will be segmented into discontinuous units.",
        "These language usages lie at the boundary between syntax and morphology, and are not uncommon in Chinese.",
        "They can be adequately represented with trees (Figure 2).",
        "VV VV VVf VVf The last reason why we should care about word",
        "the context will always make it clear what is being referred to with the term \"word\".",
        "structures is related to head driven statistical parsers (Collins, 2003).",
        "To illustrate this, note that in the Penn Chinese Treebank, the word 51 À 'English People' does not occur at all.",
        "Hence constituents headed by such words could cause some difficulty for head driven models in which out-of-vocabulary words need to be treated specially both when they are generated and when they are conditioned upon.",
        "But this word is in turn headed by its suffix À 'people', and there are 2,233 such words in Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "If we annotate the structure of every compound containing this suffix (e.g.",
        "Figure 3), such data sparsity simply goes away.",
        "Had there been only a few words with internal structures, current Chinese word segmentation paradigm would be sufficient.",
        "We could simply recover word structures in post-processing.",
        "But this is far from the truth.",
        "In Chinese there is a large number of such words.",
        "We just name a few classes of these words and give one example for each class (a dot is used to separate roots from affixes):",
        "personal name: ^M'Ä 'Nagao Makoto' location name: H^j-HH 'New York State' noun with a suffix: ^^î-lî§ 'classifier' noun with a prefix: M-JJJJ 'mother-to-be' verb with a suffix: â^M-fc 'automatize' verb with a prefix: Kï-7jC 'waterproof' adjective with a suffix: ftl^-M 'composite' adjective with a prefix: #-IEït 'informal' pronoun with a prefix: i§--{È 'everybody' time expression: – AA3l-^ 'the year 1995' ordinal number: %--\\ 'eleventh' retroflex suffixation: fô^fe-JL 'flower' This list is not meant to be complete, but we can get a feel of how extensive the words with non-trivial structures can be.",
        "With so many productive suffixes and prefixes, analyzing word structures in postprocessing is difficult, because a character may or may not act as an affix depending on the context.",
        "For example, the character À 'people' in Ü W À 'the one who plants' is a suffix, but in the personal name MWÀ 'Zhou Shuren' it isn't.",
        "The structures of these two words are shown in Figure 4.",
        "Figure 4: Two words that differ only in one character, but have different internal structures.",
        "The character À 'people' is part of a personal name in tree (a), but is a suffix in (b).",
        "A second reason why generally we cannot recover word structures in post-processing is that some words have very complex structures.",
        "For example, the tree of ilSt M 4i ^ 'anarchist' is shown in Figure 5.",
        "Parsing this structure correctly without a principled method is difficult and messy, if not impossible.",
        "Finally, it must be mentioned that we cannot store all word structures in a dictionary, as the word formation process is very dynamic and productive in nature.",
        "Take 'hall' as an example.",
        "Standard Chinese dictionaries usually contain H4à 'library', but not many other words such as M # 'aquarium' generated by this same character.",
        "This is understandable since the character 'hall' is so productive that it is impossible for a dictionary to list every word with this character as a suffix.",
        "The same thing happens for natural language processing systems.",
        "Thus it is necessary to have a dynamic mechanism for parsing word structures.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for Chinese word segmentation in which not only word boundaries are identified but the internal structures of words are recovered (Section 3).",
        "To achieve this, we design a joint morphological and syntactic parsing model of Chinese (Section 4).",
        "Our generative story describes the complete process from sentence and word structures to the surface string of characters in a top-down fashion.",
        "With this probability model, we give an algorithm to find the parse tree of a raw sentence with the highest probability (Section 5).",
        "The output of our parser incorporates word structures naturally.",
        "Evaluation shows that the model can learn much of the regularity of word structures, and also achieves reasonable accuracy in parsing higher level constituent structures (Section 6)."

        "With this model, the parsing problem is to search for the tree T* such that",
        "The generation of S is defined in a top down fashion, which can be roughly summarized as follows.",
        "First, the lexicalized constituent structures are generated, then the lexicalized structure of each word is generated.",
        "Finally, flat words with no structures are generated.",
        "As soon as this is done, we get a tree whose leaves are Chinese characters and can be concatenated to get the surface character sequence S.",
        "Each node in the constituent tree corresponds to a lexicalized context free rule where P, Li, Ri and H are lexicalized nonterminals and H is the head.",
        "To generate this constituent, first P is generated, then the head child H is generated conditioned on P, and finally each Li and Rj are generated conditioned on P and H and a distance metric.",
        "This breakdown of lexicalized PCFG rules is essentially the Model 2 defined by Collins (1999).",
        "We refer the readers to Collins' thesis for further details.",

        "For example, ÈiSL 'ism' as in MiXiSL 'modernism' is a well known and very productive suffix.",
        "Also, we can see that rules (4) and (5) are recursive and hence can handle words with very complex structures.",
        "By (3)-(5), the generation of word structures is exactly the same as that of ordinary phrase structures.",
        "Hence the probabilities of these words can be defined in the same way as higher level constituents in (2).",
        "Note that in our case, each word with structures is naturally lexicalized, since in the annotation process we have been careful to record the head position of each complex word.",
        "As an example, consider a word w = R(r) S(s) where R is the root part-of-speech headed by the word r, and S is the suffix part-of-speech headed by s. If the head of this word is its suffix, then we can define the probability of w by trivial and deterministic since every phrase and word structure rules are lexicalized.",

        "During training, words that occur less than 6 times are substituted with the symbol U NK NOWN.",
        "In testing, unknown words are generated after the generation of symbol UNKNOWN, and we define their probability by a first-order Markov model.",

        "Note that the generation of w is only conditioned on its part-of-speech p, ignoring the larger constituent or word in which w occurs.",

        "With this classification, we report our parser's accuracy for phrase labels, which is approximately the accuracy of constituent parsing of Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "We report our parser's word segmentation accuracy based on the flat labels.",
        "This accuracy is in fact the joint accuracy of segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Most importantly, we can report our parser's accuracy in recovering word structures based on POS labels and flat labels, since word structures may contain only these two kinds of labels.",
        "With the standard split of CTB 5.0 data into training, development and test sets (Zhang and Clark, 2009), the result are summarized in Table 1.",
        "For all label categories, the PARSEEVAL measures (Abney et al., 1991) are used in computing the labeled precision and recall.",
        "Table 1: Labeled precision and recall for the three types of labels.",
        "The line labeled 'Flat*' is for unlabeled metrics of flat words, which is effectively the ordinary word segmentation accuracy.",
        "Though not directly comparable, we can make some remarks to the accuracy of our model.",
        "For constituent parsing, the best result on CTB 5.0 is reported to be 78% Fi measure for unlimited sentences with automatically assigned POS tags (Zhang and Clark, 2009).",
        "Our result for phrase labels is close to this accuracy.",
        "Besides, the result for flat labels compares favorably with the state of the art accuracy of about 93% Fi for joint word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging (Jiang et al., 2008; Kruengkrai et al., 2009).",
        "For ordinary word segmentation, the best result is reported to be around 97% parser performs at 97.3%, though we should remember that the result concerns flat words only.",
        "Finally, we see the performance of word structure recovery is almost as good as the recognition of flat words.",
        "This means that parsing word structures accurately is possible with a generative model.",
        "It is interesting to see how well the parser does in recognizing the structure of words that were not seen during training.",
        "For this, we sampled 100 such words including those with prefixes or suffixes and personal names.",
        "We found that for 82 of these words, our parser can correctly recognize their structures.",
        "This means our model has learnt something that generalizes well to unseen words.",
        "In error analysis, we found that the parser tends to over generalize for prefix and suffix characters.",
        "For example, AfËîi 'great writer' is a noun phrase consisting of an adjective A 'great' and a noun fËi?",
        "'writer', as shown in Figure 10(a), but our parser incorrectly analyzed it into a root AfË 'masterpiece' and a suffix ii 'expert', as in Figure 10(b).",
        "This",
        "JJf NNf AfÈ M is because the character i 'expert' is a very productive suffix, as in i 'chemist' and 5Si 'diplomat'.",
        "This observation is illuminating because most errors of our parser follow this pattern.",
        "Currently we don't have any non-ad hoc way ofprevent-ing such kind of over generalization."

        "In this paper we proposed a new paradigm for Chinese word segmentation in which not only flat words were identified but words with structures were also parsed.",
        "We gave good reasons why this should be done, and we presented an effective method showing how this could be done.",
        "With the progress in statistical parsing technology and the development of large scale treebanks, the time has now come for this paradigm shift to happen.",
        "We believe such a new paradigm for word segmentation is linguistically justified and pragmatically beneficial to real world applications.",
        "We showed that word structures can be recovered with high precision, though there's still much room for improvement, especially for higher level constituent parsing.",
        "Our model is generative, but discriminative models such as maximum entropy technique (Berger et al., 1996) can be used in parsing word structures too.",
        "Many parsers using these techniques have been proved to be quite successful (Luo, 2003; Fung et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006).",
        "Another possible direction is to combine generative models with discriminative reranking to enhance the accuracy (Collins and Koo, 2005; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "Finally, we must note that the use of flat labels such as \"NNf\" is less than ideal.",
        "The most important reason these labels are used is we want to compare the performance of our parser with previous results in constituent parsing, part-of-speech tagging and word segmentation, as we did in Section 6.",
        "The problem with this approach is that word structures and phrase structures are then not treated in a truly unified way, and besides the 33 part-of-speech tags originally contained in Penn Chinese Treebank, another 33 tags ending with 'f' are introduced.",
        "We leave this problem open for now and plan to address it in future work.",
