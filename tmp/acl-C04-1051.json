        "The importance of learning to manipulate monolingual paraphrase relationships for applications like summarization, search, and dialog has been highlighted by a number of recent efforts (Barzilay & McKeown 2001; Shinyama et al.",
        "2002; Lee & Barzilay 2003; Lin & Pantel 2001).",
        "While several different learning methods have been applied to this problem, all share a need for large amounts of data in the form of pairs or sets of strings that are likely to exhibit lexical and/or structural paraphrase alternations.",
        "One approach1",
        "that has been successfully used is edit distance, a measure of similarity between strings.",
        "The assumption is that strings separated by a small edit distance will tend to be similar in meaning: The leading indicators measure the economy...",
        "The leading index measures the economy.... Lee & Barzilay (2003), for example, use Multi-Sequence Alignment (MSA) to build a corpus of paraphrases involving terrorist acts.",
        "Their goal is to extract sentential templates that can be used in high-precision generation of paraphrase alternations within a limited domain.",
        "Our goal here is rather different: our interest lies in constructing a monolingual broad-domain corpus of pairwise aligned sentences.",
        "Such data would be amenable to conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques (e.g., those discussed in Och & Ney 2003).2 In what follows we compare two strategies for unsupervised construction of such a corpus, one employing string similarity and the other associating sentences that may overlap very little at the string level.",
        "We measure the relative utility of the two derived monolingual corpora in the context of word alignment techniques developed originally for bilingual text.",
        "We show that although the edit distance corpus is well-suited as training data for the alignment algorithms currently used in SMT, it is an incomplete source of information about paraphrase relations, which exhibit many of the characteristics of comparable bilingual corpora or free translations.",
        "Many of the more complex alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase, such as large-scale lexical alternations and constituent reorderings, are not readily learning sentence level paraphrases, including major constituent reorganizations, we do not address this approach here.",

        "An additional filter ensured that the word count of the shorter sentence is at least one-half that of the longer sentence.",

        "Accordingly, the dataset encompasses many paraphrases that would have been excluded under a more stringent edit-distance threshold, for example, the following non-paraphrase pair that contain an element of paraphrase: A staggering %%number%% million Americans have been victims of identity theft in the last five years , according to federal trade commission survey out this week.",
        "In the last year alone, %%number%% million people have had their identity purloined.",
        "Nevertheless, even after filtering in these ways, a significant amount of unfiltered noise remains in the F2 corpus, which consisted of 214K sentence pairs.",

        "The remaining ~40% were assessed as",
        "unrelated.4 Thus, although the F2 data set is nominally larger than the L12 data set, when the noise factor is taken into account, the actual number of full paraphrase sentences in this data set is estimated to be in the region of 56K sentences, with a further estimated 72K sentences containing some paraphrase material that might be a potential source of alignment.",
        "Some of these relations captured in this data can be complex.",
        "The following pair, for example, would be unlikely to pass muster on edit distance grounds, but nonetheless contains an inversion of deep semantic roles, employing different lexical items.",

        "An Indonesian court today sentenced two men to %%number%% years in prison for helping finance last year's terrorist bombings in Bali by robbing a jewelry store.",

        "counterpart in the other (e.g. the NASDAQ/ the tech-heavy NASDAQ).",

        "Some are non-compositional idioms (has pulled the plug on / is dropping plans for); others involve different phrasing (electronically / in electronic form, more than a million people / a massive crowd).",

        "• Synonymy: Sentence pairs differ only in one or two words (e.g. charges / accusations), suggesting an editor’s hand in modifying a single source sentence.",

        "Cases of NP anaphora (ISS / the Atlanta-based security company) are also common in the data, but in quantifying paraphrase types we restricted our attention to the simpler case of pronominal anaphora.",
        "• Reordering: Words, phrases, or entire",
        "constituents occur in different order in two related sentences, either because of major syntactic differences (e.g. topicalization, voice alternations) or more local pragmatic choices (e.g. adverb or prepositional phrase placement).",
        "These categories do not cover all possible alternations between pairs of paraphrased sentences; moreover, categories often overlap in the same sequence of words.",

        "To quantify the differences between L12 and F2, we randomly chose 100 sentence pairs from each dataset and counted the number of times each phenomenon was encountered.",
        "A given sentence pair might exhibit multiple instances of a single phenomenon, such as two phrasal paraphrase changes or two synonym replacements.",

        "We believe that this work has potential impact on the fields of summarization, information retrieval, and question answering.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to apply current SMT techniques to the problems of paraphrase recognition and generation.",
        "We feel that this is a natural extension of the body of recent developments in SMT; perhaps explorations in monolingual data may have a reciprocal impact.",
