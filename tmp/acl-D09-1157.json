        "While technology on named entity recognition (NER) matures, many researchers in the field of information extraction (IE) gradually shifted their focus to more complex tasks such as named entity disambiguation and relation extraction.",
        "Both tasks are particularly important for biomedical text mining, which concerns automatically extracting facts from the exponentially growing biomedical literature (Hunter and Cohen, 2006).",
        "One type of facts is relations between biomedical named entities, such as disease-drug relation, gene-disease relation, protein-protein interaction (PPI), etc.",
        "To automatically extract these facts, advanced natural language processing techniques such as parsing have been adopted to analyse the syntactic and semantic structure of text.",
        "The idea is that linguistic structures between the interacting biological entities may have common characteristics that can be exploited by similarity measures or machine learning algorithms.",
        "For example, Erkan et al.",
        "(2007) used the shortest path between two genes according to edit distance in a dependency tree to define a kernel function for extracting gene interactions.",
        "Miwa et al.",
        "(2008) comparably evaluated a number of kernels for incorporating syntactic features, including the bag-of-word kernel, the subset tree kernel (Moschitti, 2006) and the graph kernel (Airola et al., 2008), and they concluded that combining all kernels achieved better results than using any individual one.",
        "Miyao et al.",
        "(2008) used syntactic paths as one of the features to train a support vector machines (SVM) model for PPIs and also discussed how different parsers and output representations affected the end results.",
        "Another crucial IE task is named entity disambiguation, which concerns grounding mentions of named entities in text to unambiguous concepts as defined in some standard dictionary or database.",
        "For instance, given a search term Python, users may like to see the results grouped into the following categories: a type of snake, a programming language, or a film (Bunescu and Pasxa, 2006).",
        "One approach to such lexical disambiguation tasks is supervised classification.",
        "However, such techniques suffer from the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, meaning that manually annotating training data is costly and can never satisfy the need by the machine learning algorithms.",
        "In addition, supervised techniques may not yield reliable results when the distributions of the semantic classes are different in the training and test datasets (Agirre and Martinez, 2004; Koeling et al., 2005).",
        "For example, on the task of word sense disambiguation, a model trained on a dataset where the predominant sense of the word star is \"heavenly body\", may not work well on text mainly composed of entertainment news.",
        "Such problems are also major concerns when developing a system to disambiguate biomedical named entities (e.g., protein,",

        "This paper proposes a new disambiguation method that, instead of classifying each individual occurrence of an entity, it classifies pairwise relations between the entity mention in question and the \"cue words\" in its adjacent context, where each cue word is assumed to bear a semantic class.",
        "We then select the cue word that has a positive relation with the entity, and pass its semantic tag to it.",
        "While an individual entity mention may belong to a large number of semantic classes, a relation can only take one of two values: positive or negative, hence transforming a complex multi-classification problem into a less complicated binary classification task.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 proposes the disambiguation method and Section 3 introduces the task of disambiguating the model organisms of biomedical named entities.",
        "Section 4 describes in detail our proposed method and also a number of baseline systems for comparison purposes.",

        "When \\D\\ is small, the problem can be approached by supervised classification.",
        "For example, to determine whether an occurrence of an entity is a protein, a gene or an RNA, Hatzivassiloglou et al.",
        "(2001) compared performance of 3 supervised classification methods and reported results near the human agreement rate.",
        "Nevertheless, when \\D\\ is large (e.g., > 100), the performance of classification may decrease, especially when the distribution of d in training dataset differs from that in the test set.",
        "In other words, when \\D\\is large, named entity disambiguation becomes a multi-class classification task on heterogeneous and imbalanced datasets, which is challenging for a machine learning model to learn to discriminate enough between the semantic classes (Japkowicz, 2000).",
        "We propose an alternative method for named entity disambiguation.",
        "Intuitively, in the surrounding context of an ambiguous entity, one can often find \"cue words\" that are informative indicators of the entity's semantic category.",
        "These cue words are provided by authors to remind readers the semantic identity of a named entity.",
        "For example, in an article about protein p53, phrase \"human protein p53\" may be mentioned, where both human and protein contain semantic information regarding p53: human indicates the model organism of p53, and protein suggests the type of this entity.",
        "Such cue words may occur infrequently in the training data, making it difficult for machine learning classifiers to capture.",
        "Our method exploits this observation.",
        "Given a sentence, let E be the set of 'target' entities (e.g., p53) and W of the 'cue' words (e.g., human) that co-occur in a sentence, we define a relation as a pair r = (e,w), where eeE and w G W, and r is a positive relation if e belongs to the semantic class indicated by w, and is a negative one if not.",
        "Then we can disambiguate e by accomplishing the following steps: 1) identify W and build a set of relations R = {(e, Wi)\\wi G W, i = 1,2,.., n}, where n is the size of W; and 2) classify every r G R and assign the semantic tag of Wj to e such that Vj = (e, Wj) is positive.",
        "The first task can be tackled by a dictionary lookup, or by an NER system, if manually annotated data is available.",
        "The second is essentially a binary relation classification task, and in this work, we use an SVM model exploiting bag-of-word and syntactic features."

        "The species disambiguation experiments were conducted using the iti-TXM corpus (Alex et al., 2008b), a collection of full-length biomedical research articles manually annotated with linguistic and biomedical information for developing automatic information extraction systems.",
        "The corpus contains two datasets covering slightly different domains: enriched protein-protein interaction (eppi) and tissue expression (TE).",
        "Whenever possible, protein, protein complex, gene, and mRNA/cDNA entities were tagged with NCBI Taxonomy IDs, denoting their species, and it was the species annotation that this study used.",
        "The EPPI and TE datasets have different distributions of species.",
        "The entities in EPPI belong to 118 species with human being the most frequent at 51.98%.",
        "In TE, the entities are across 67 species and mouse is the most frequent at 44.67%.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement of species annotation on EPPI and TE are 86.45% and 95.11%, respectively.",
        "The species disambiguation systems were developed on the training portions of the EPPI and te corpora, each containing 221 articles, and evaluated on a dataset combining the development test (devtest) datasets of EPPI and te, containing 58 and 48 articles, respectively.",
        "The combined training dataset contains 96, 992 entity mentions belonging to 138 model organisms, while the devtest dataset contains 23,118 entities of 54 species.",
        "The diversity of model organisms in this corpus highlights the fact that a primary consideration when developing a species disambiguation system is its ability to distinguish a wide range of species with minimal additional manual effort.",
        "The evaluation was carried out on the devtest dataset, and the systems are compared using av-",
        "Table 2: Evaluation results of the classification systems on devtest (precision/recall/Fl-score, in %) eraged precision, recall and Fl scores over all species.",
        "In more detail, for each model organism that appears in the devtest dataset, we collect two lists of entity mentions of that species: one from the gold-standard devtest dataset, and the other from the output of a disambiguation system.",
        "Then the list of system output is compared against the gold-standard list to obtain precision, recall and Fl score.",
        "For each system, the scores obtained from all species are averaged using micro-average and macro-average.",
        "The micro-average is the mean of the summation of contingency metrics for all model organisms, so that scores of the more frequent species influence the mean more than those of less frequent ones.",
        "The macro-average is the mean of precision, recall, or Fl over all labels, thus attributing equal weights to each species, and measuring a system's adaptability across different model organisms.",
        "First of all, Table 2 shows the results of the classification methods described in Section 4.2.",
        "The multi-classification system using a maximum entropy model (Maxent) yielded the highest overall micro-averaged Fl.",
        "Among the SVM-based systems, the one using IG feature selection achieved better performance.",
        "In particular, it outperformed the Maxent model in term of macro-averages.",
        "The performance of the SVM model with BNS feature selection is disappointing, perhaps because the occurrences of a feature in each instance are not normally distributed.",
        "As the Maxent system obtained better results, it was used to compare with other disambiguation systems.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of a number of methods described in the previous sections.",
        "The methods are categorised into 4 groups: rule-based baseline systems, a Maxent classification model, relation-classification methods, and a hybrid system.",
        "The difference between the relation classification systems is the features adopted.",
        "Rel-Context was trained on only bag-of-word and distance features, whereas each other system also used syntactic features provided by a specific parser.",
        "For example, the Rel-RASP system identifies an entity's species by finding positive relations between the entity and its neighbouring species words, using features including bag-of-word, distance, and dependency paths generated by RASP.",
        "The hybrid system (Hbrd) ran the Rel-ENJU-Genia system on top of the outcome of Maxent.",
        "When a conflict occurs, the species ID is chosen by Rel-ENJU-Genia.",
        "The idea is that the relation classification system is more accurate than Maxent when it is applicable, and hence would improve precision on disambiguating the species with few or no training instances.",
        "Without spreading (shown in the \"NO SPRD\" columns of Table 3), most of the rule-based and relation classification systems only work on a subset of DEVTEST, resulting in low recall: Rule-Sp works on the small proportion of entities (5.68%) with a preceding species word, while the other systems only work on the collection of sentences containing at least one species word and one entity, which covers 4.60% sentences and 22.16% entity mentions.",
        "Rule-Majority, Maxent, and Hbrd, on the other hand, apply to all entity mentions, and therefore they are only compared against the others when spreading was applied.",
        "The results shown in the \"NO SPRD\" columns can be viewed as a comparative evaluation of the usefulness of the syntactic features supplied by the parsers on this particular task.",
        "The rule-based systems set high baselines: Rule-Sp produced good precision and Rule-SpSent achieved the highest micro-averaged Fl, thanks to its high coverage, which is also an upperbound of recall for the relation classification systems.",
        "Nevertheless, it is encouraging that the relation classification systems obtained higher precision than Rule-SpSent, which is important, considering the decisions will be transfered to the untagged entity mentions across the document.",
        "Indeed, as shown in the SPRD columns in Table 3, most relation classification systems outperformed the Rule-SpSent baseline when spreading was used.",
        "The scores of the systems using different parser outputs only vary slightly.",
        "Rel-Context, on the other hand, surpassed others in terms of micro-averaged precision, while sacrificing micro-averaged recall and macro-averaged scores.",

        "Table 3: Evaluation results of the species disambiguation systems on devtest (precision/recall/Fl-score, in %) effectively improved recall (see Section 5.2.3 for discussion on statistical significance tests on the results).",
        "The Maxent system achieved very good micro-averaged precision, but low macro-averaged scores.",
        "In fact, as shown in Table 4, Maxent can only disambiguate 7 species (out of a total of 54) that have relatively large amount of training instances, and failed completely on other species.",
        "This suggests that Maxent may not be able to generate good micro-averaged scores when applied to a dataset where the dominant species are different from those in the training set.",
        "On the other hand, the relation-classification approaches have a clear advantage over Maxent as measured by macro-averaged scores.",
        "As shown in Table 4, Rel-ENJU-Genia worked well on most of the species, displaying its good adaptability, while achieving comparable micro-averaged Fl to Maxent.",
        "Overall, Hbrd, which combines the strengths of relation classification and the Maxent classification model, obtained the highest points as measured by every metric.",
        "To see whether our methods significantly improved the baseline systems, we performed randomisation tests (Noreen, 1989; Yeh, 2000) on some of the results shown in Table 3.",
        "The intuition of randomisation test is as follows: when comparing two systems (e.g., A and B), we erase the labels \"output of A\" or \"output of B\" from all observations.",
        "The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between A and B, and thus any response produced by one of the systems could have as likely come from the other.",

        "Let r denote the number of times that such a difference occurred, then as R â > oo, approaches the significance level.",
        "In our case, the metrics tested were micro-and macro-averaged precision, recall and Fl.",
        "Following this procedure, we tested whether the improvements made by a relation classification based system (i.e., Rel-ENJU-Genia with SPRD) and the hybrid system (i.e., Hbrd) over the baseline systems were statistically significant.",
        "We carried out approximate randomisation with 10,000 shuffles and the test results are shown in Table 5.",
        "The numerical figures in the cells are differences in precision, recall and Fl between a pair of systems.",

        "As measured by micro-averaged Fl score, a supervised classification approach (Maxent) yielded the second best result.",
        "However, it can only disambiguate a small number of species that have abundant training instances.",
        "With spreading rules, a relation classification system (Rel-ENJU-Genia) trained on word and syntactic features from ENJU-Genia also obtained good micro-averaged Fl, while surpassing Maxent significantly in terms of macro-averaged scores.",
        "Combining these two systems achieved the best overall performance.",
        "Nevertheless, we combined the two methods in a rather crude way, leaving ample room for exploring better strategies in the future.",
