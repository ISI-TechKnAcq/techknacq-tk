        "Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis is a process which artificially produces synthetic speech for various applications such as services over telephone, e-document reading, and speaking system for handicapped people etc.",
        "The two primary technologies for generating synthetic speech are concatenative synthesis and formant (Rule-based) synthesis methods.",
        "Con-catenative synthesis produces the most naturalsounding synthesized speech.",
        "However, it requires a large amount of linguistic resources and generating a various speaking style is a challenging task.",
        "In general the amount of work required to build a concatenative system is enormous.",
        "Particularly, for languages with limited linguistic resources, it is more difficult.",
        "On the other hand, formant synthesis method requires small linguistic resources and able to generate various speaking styles.",
        "It is also suitable for mobile applications and easier for customization.",
        "However, this method produced less natural-sounding synthesized speech and the complex rules required to model the prosody is a big problem.",
        "In general, each method has its own strengths and weaknesses and there is always a tradeoff.",
        "Therefore, which approach to use will be determined by the intended applications, the availability of linguistic resources of a given language etc.",
        "In our research we used formant (rule-based) synthesis method because we are intending to prepare a general framework for Ethiopian Semitic languages and apply it for mobile devices and web embedded applications.",
        "Currently, many speech synthesis systems are available mainly for 'major' languages such as English, Japanese etc.",
        "and successful results are obtained in various application areas.",
        "However, thousands of the world's 'minor' languages lack such technologies, and researches in the area are quite very few.",
        "Although recently many localization projects (like the customization of Festvox) are being undergoing for many languages, it is quite inadequate and the localization process is not an easy task mainly because of the lack of linguistic resources and absence of similar works in the area.",
        "Therefore, there is a strong demand for the development of a speech synthesizer for many of the African minor languages such as Amharic.",
        "Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, is a Semitic language that has the greatest number of speakers after Arabic.",
        "According to the 1998 census, Amharic has 17.4 million speaker as a mother thong language and 5.1 million speakers as a second language.",
        "However, it is one of the least supported and least researched languages in the world.",
        "Although, recently, the development of different natural language processing (NLP) tools for analyzing Amharic text has begun, it is often very far comparing with other languages (Alemu et al., 2003).",
        "Particularly, researches conducted on language technologies like speech synthesis and the application of such technologies are very limited or unavailable.",
        "To the knowledge of the authors, so far there is only one published work (Sebsibe, 2004) in the area of speech synthesis for Amharic.",
        "In this study they tried to describe the issues to be considered in developing a concatenative speech synthesizer using Festvox and recommended using syllables as a basic unit for high quality speech synthesis.",
        "In our research we developed a syllabic based TTS system with prosodic control method which is the first rule-based system published for Am-haric.",
        "The designed Amharic TTS (AmhTTS) is parametric and rule-based system that employs a Cepstral method and uses a Log Magnitude Approximation (LMA) filter.",
        "Unlike the previous study, Sebsibe (2004), our study provides a total solution on prosodic information generation mainly by modeling the durations.",
        "The system is expected to have a wide range of applications, for example, in software aids to visually impaired people, in mobile phones and can also be easily customized for other Ethiopian languages."

        "Amharic (hÂ°ic?)",
        "is a Semitic language and it is one of the most widely spoken languages in Ethiopia.",
        "It has its own non Latin based syllabic script called \"Fidel\" or \"Abugida\".",
        "The orthographic representation of the language is organized into orders (derivatives) as shown in Fig.1.",
        "Six of them are CV (C is a consonant, V is a vowel) combinations while the sixth order is the consonant itself.",
        "In total there are 32 consonants and 7 vowels with 7x32= 224 Syllables.",
        "But since there are redundant sounds that represent the same sounds, the phonemes are only 28 (see the Appendix).",
        "Figure 1 : Amharic Syllables structure",
        "Like other languages, Amharic also has its own typical phonological and morphological features that characterize it.",
        "The following are some of the striking features of Amharic phonology that gives the language its characteristic sound when one hears it spoken: the weak, indeterminate stress; the presence of glottalic, palatal, and labialized consonants; the frequent gemination of consonants and central vowels; and the use of an automatic helping vowel (Bender et al., 1976).",
        "Gemination in Amharic is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the cadence of the speech, and also caries a very heavy semantic and syntactic functional weight (Bender and Fu-lass, 1978).",
        "Amharic gemination is either lexical or morphological.",
        "Gemination as a lexical feature cannot be predicted.",
        "For instance, hrt may be read as aid meaning 'he said', or alld meaning 'there is'.",
        "Although this is not a problem for Am-haric speakers, it is a challenging problem in speech synthesis.",
        "As a morphological feature gemination is more predictable in the verb than in the noun, Bender and Fulass (1978).",
        "However, this is also a challenging problem in speech synthesis because to automatically identify the location of geminated syllables, it requires analysis and modeling of the complex morphology of the language.",
        "The lack of the orthography of Am-haric to show geminates is the main problem.",
        "In this study, we used our own manual gemination mark (') insertion techniques (see Section 3.3.1).",
        "The sixth order syllables are the other important features of the language.",
        "Like geminates, the sixth order syllables are also very frequent and play a key role for proper pronunciation of speech.",
        "In our previous study, (Tadesse and Ta-kara, 2006) we found that geminates and sixth order syllables are the two most important features that play a key role for proper pronunciation of words.",
        "Therefore, in our study we mainly consider these language specific features to develop a high quality speech synthesizer for Am-haric language."

        "The text analysis subsystem extracts the linguistic and prosodic information from the input text.",
        "The program iterates through the input text and extracts the gemination and other marks, and the sequences of syllables using the syllabification rule.",
        "The letter-to-sound conversion has simple one-to-one mapping between orthography and phonetic transcription (see Apendix).",
        "As defined by (Baye, 2008; Dawkins, 1969) and others, Amharic can be considered as a phonetic language with relatively simple relationship between orthography and phonology.",
        "First, as a speech database, all Amharic syllables (196) were collected and their sounds were prepared by recording on digital audio tape (DAT) at a 48 kHz sampling rate and 16-bit value.",
        "After that, they were down-sampled to 10 kHz for analyzing.",
        "All speech units were recorded with normal speaking rate.",
        "Then, the speech sounds were analyzed by the analysis system.",
        "The analysis system adopts short-time cepstral analysis with frame length 25.6 ms and frame shifting time of 10 ms. A time-domain Hamming window with a length of 25.6 ms is used in analysis.",
        "The cepstrum is defined as the inverse Fourier transform of the short-time logarithm amplitude spectrum (Furui, 2001).",
        "Cepstral analysis has the advantage that it could separate the spectral envelope part and the excitation part.",
        "The resulting parameters of speech unit include the number of frames and, for each frame, voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) decision, pitch period and cepstral coefficients c[m], 0 < m < 29.",
        "The speech database contains these parameters as shown in fig.2.",
        "Finally, the speech synthesis subsystem generates speech from pre-stored parameters under the control of the prosodic rules.",
        "For speech synthesis, the general source-filter model is used as a speech production model as shown in fig.3.",
        "The synthetic sound is produced using Log Magnitude Approximation (LMA) filter (Imai, 1980) as the system filter, for which cepstral coefficients are used to characterize the speech sound.",
        "The LMA filter presents the vocal tract characteristics that are estimated in 30 lower-order que-frency elements.",
        "The LMA filter is a pole-zero filter that is able to efficiently represent the vocal tract features for all speech sounds.",
        "The LMA filter is controlled by cepstrum parameters as vocal tract parameters, and it is driven by fundamental period impulse series for voiced sounds and by white noise for unvoiced sounds.",
        "The fundamental frequency (F0) of the speech is controlled by the impulse series of the fundamental period.",
        "The gain of the filter or the power of synthesized speech is set by the 0th order cepstral coefficient, c [0].",
        "For any language, appropriate modeling of prosody is the most important issue for developing a high quality speech synthesizer.",
        "In Amharic language segments duration is the most important and useful component in prosody control.",
        "It is shown that, unlike English language in which the rhythm of the speech is mainly characterized by stress (loudness), rhythm in Amharic is mainly marked by longer and shorter syllables depending on gemination of consonants, and by certain features of phrasing (Bender et al., 1976).",
        "Therefore it is very important to model the syllables duration in AmhTTS system.",
        "In this paper we propose a new segmental duration control methods for synthesizing a high quality speech.",

        "Prosodic phrases are determined in simplified way by using text punctuation.",
        "To synthesize F0 contour Fujisaki pitch model that superimpose both word level and phrase level prosody modulations is used (Takara and Jun, 1988).",
        "The following subsections discuss the prosodic control methods employed in our system.",
        "Accurate estimation of segmental duration for different groups of geminate consonants (stops, nasals, liquids, glides, fricatives) will be crucial for natural sounding of AmhTTS system.",
        "In our previous study, Tadesse and Takara (2006), we studied the durational difference between singletons vs. geminates of contrastive words and determined the threshold duration for different groups of consonants.",
        "Accordingly the following rule was implemented based on the threshold durations we obtained in our previous study.",
        "The gemination rule is programmed in the system and generates geminates from singletons by using a simple durational control method.",
        "It generates geminates by lengthening the duration of the consonant part of the syllables following the gemination mark.",
        "Two types of rules were prepared for two groups of consonants, continuant (voiced and unvoiced) and non-continuant (stops and glottalized) consonants.",
        "If a gemination mark (') is followed by syllable with voiced or unvoiced consonant then, the last three frames of the cepstral parameters (c[0]) of vowel is adjusted linearly and then 120 ms of frame 1, 2 and 3 of second syllable is added.",
        "Then the second syllable is connected after frame 4.",
        "Totally 90 ms of cepstral parameters is added.",
        "Otherwise, if, a gemination mark (') is followed by syllable with glottal or non-glottal consonant then, the last three frames of the cepstral parameters (c[0]) of vowel is adjusted linearly and then 100 ms of silence is added.",
        "Finally the second syllable is directly connected.",
        "Since Amharic orthography does not use gemination mark, in our study we used our own gemination mark and a manual gemination insertion mechanism for input texts.",
        "Although some scholars make use of two dots ( which is proposed in UNICODE 5.1 version as 135F) over a consonant to show gemination, so far there is no software which supports this mark.",
        "As mentioned earlier the sixth order syllables are very frequent and play a major role for proper pronunciation of words.",
        "The sixth order orthographic syllables, which do not have any vowel unit associated to it in the written form, may associate the helping vowel (epenthetic vowel /ix/, see the Apendix) in its spoken form (Dawkins, 1969).",
        "The sixth order syllables are ambiguous; they can stand for either a consonant in isolation or a consonant with the short vowel.",

        "Fig.4 and fig.6 shows the waveform of original words just for comparison purpose only.",
        "The two synthesized words are comparative words which differ only by presence or absence of gemination.",

        "However, in the second word /sxixffixta/ meaning 'rash', the sixth order syllable /f/ is voweled and longer /ffix/ (see fig.7) because it is geminated.",

        "The connections are implemented either by smoothing or interpolating the cepstral coefficients, F0 and amplitude at the boundary.",
        "Generally, we drive two types of syllabic joining patterns.",
