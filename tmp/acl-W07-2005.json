        "The SemEval-2007 task to disambiguate prepositions was designed as a lexical sample task to investigate the extent to which an important closed class of words could be disambiguated.",
        "In addition, because they are a closed class, with stable senses, the requisite datasets for this task are enduring and can be used as long as the problem of preposition disambiguation remains.",
        "The data used in this task was developed in The Preposition Project (TPP,",
        "with further refinements to fit the requirements of a SemEval task.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe the motivations for a preposition disambiguation task.",
        "Next, we describe the development of the datasets used for the task, i.e., the instance sets and the sense inventories.",
        "We describe how the task was performed and how it was evaluated (essentially using the same scoring methods as previous Senseval lexical sample tasks).",
        "We present the results obtained from the participating teams and provide an initial analysis of these results.",
        "Finally, we identify several further types of analyses that will provide further insights into the characterization of preposition behavior."

      "text": [
        "Prepositions are a closed class, meaning that the number of prepositions remains relatively constant and that their meanings are relatively stable.",
        "Despite this, their treatment in computational linguistics has been somewhat limited.",
        "In the Penn Treebank, only two types of prepositions are recognized (IN (locative, temporal, and manner) and TO (direction)) (O?Hara, 2005).",
        "Prepositions are viewed as function words that occur with high frequency and therefore carry little meaning.",
        "A task to disambiguate prepositions would, in the first place, allow this limited treatment to be confronted more fully.",
        "Preposition behavior has been the subject of much research, too voluminous to cite here.",
        "Three recent workshops on prepositions have been sponsored by the ACL-SIGSEM: Toulouse in 2003, Colchester in 2005, and Trento in 2006.",
        "For the most part, these workshops have focused on individual prepositions, with various investigations of more generalized behavior.",
        "The SemEval preposition disambiguation task provides a vehicle to examine whether these behaviors are substantiated with a well-defined set of corpus instances.",
        "Prepositions assume more importance when they1http://www.clres.com/prepositions.html.",
        "are considered in relation to verbs.",
        "While linguistic theory focuses on subjects and objects as important verb arguments, quite frequently there is an additional oblique argument realized in a prepositional phrase.",
        "But with the focus on the verbs, the prepositional phrases do not emerge as having more than incidental importance.",
        "However, within frame semantics (Fillmore, 1976), prepositions rise to a greater prominence; frequently, two or three prepositional phrases are identified as constituting frame elements.",
        "In addition, frame semantic analyses indicate the possibility of a greater number of prepositional phrases acting as adjuncts (particularly identifying time and location frame elements).",
        "While linguistic theories may identify only one or two prepositions associated with an argument of a verb, frame semantic analyses bring in the possibility of a greater variety of prepositions introducing the same type of frame element.",
        "The preposition disambiguation task provides an opportunity to examine this type of variation.",
        "The question of prepositional phrase attachment is another important issue.",
        "Merlo & Esteve Ferrer (2006) suggest that this problem is a four-way disambiguation task, depending on the properties of nouns and verbs and whether the prepositional phrases are arguments or adjuncts.",
        "Their analysis relied on Penn Treebank data.",
        "Further insights may be available from the finer-grained data available in the preposition disambiguation task.",
        "Another important thread of investigation concerning preposition behavior is the task of semantic role (and perhaps semantic relation) labeling (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras & Marquez (2004) and Carreras & Marquez (2005)).",
        "In addition, three other tasks in SemEval-2007 (semantic relations between nominals, task 4; temporal relation labeling, task 15; and frame semantic structure extraction, task 19) address issues of semantic role labeling.",
        "Since a great proportion of these semantic roles are realized in prepositional phrases, this gives greater urgency to understanding preposition behavior.",
        "Despite the predominant view of prepositions as function words carrying little meaning, this view is not borne out in dictionary treatment of their definitions.",
        "To all appearances, prepositions exhibit definitional behavior similar to that of open class words.",
        "There is a reasonably large number of distinct prepositions and they show a range of polysemous senses.",
        "Thus, with a suitable set of instances, they may be amenable to the same types of analyses as open class words."
