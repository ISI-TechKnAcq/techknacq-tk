        "Arabic is a morphologically rich language: in our training corpus of about 288,000 words we find 3279 distinct morphological tags, with up to 100,000 possible tags.",
        "Because of the large number of tags, it is clear that morphological tagging cannot be construed as a simple classification task.",
        "Hajic (2000) is the first to use a dictionary as a source of possible morphological analyses (and hence tags) for an inflected word form.",
        "He redefines the tagging task as a choice among the tags proposed by the dictionary, using a log-linear model trained on specific ambiguity classes for individual morphological features.",
        "Hajic et al.",
        "(2005) implement the approach of Hajic (2000) for Arabic.",
        "In previous work, we follow the same approach (Habash and Rambow, 2005), using SVM-classifiers for individual morphological features and a simple combining scheme for choosing among competing analyses proposed by the dictionary.",
        "Since the dictionary we use, BAMA (Buckwalter, 2004), also includes diacritics (orthographic marks not usually written), we extend this approach to the diacritization task in (Habash and Rambow, 2007).",
        "The work presented in this paper differs from this previous work in that (a) we introduce a new task for Arabic, namely lemmatization; (b) we use an explicit modeling of lexemes as a component in all tasks discussed in this paper (morphological tagging, diacritization, and lemmatization); and (c) we tune the weights of the feature classifiers on a tuning corpus (different tuning for different tasks)."

        "We define the task of morphological tagging as choosing an inflectional morphological tag (in this paper, the term \"morphological tagging\" never refers to derivational morphology).",
        "The morphology of an Arabic word can be described by the 14 (nearly) orthogonal features shown in Figure 1.",
        "For different tasks, different subsets may be useful: for example, when translating into a language without case, we may want to omit the case feature.",
        "For the experiments we discuss in this paper, we investigate three variants of the morphological tagging tasks: MorphPOS (determining the feature POS, which is the core part-of-speech - verb, noun, adjective, etc.",
        "); MorphPart (determining the set of the first ten basic morphological features listed in Figure 1); and Mor-phAll (determining the full inflectional morphological tag, i.e., all 14 features).",
        "The task of diacritization involves adding diacritics (short vowels, gemination marker shadda, and indefiniteness marker nunation) to the standard written form.",
        "We have two variants of the diacritization",
        "Figure 1: List of (inflectional) morphological features used in our system; the first ten are features which (roughly) can be determined with higher accuracy since they rely less on syntactic context and more on visible inflectional morphology",
        "tasks: DiacFull (predicting all diacritics of a given word), which relates to lexeme choice and morphology tagging, and DiacPart (predicting all diacritics of a given word except those associated with the final letter), which relates largely to lexeme choice.",
        "Lemmatization (LexChoice) for Arabic has not been discussed in the literature to our knowledge.",
        "A lexeme is an abstraction over a set of inflected word forms, and it is usually represented by its citation form, also called lemma.",
        "Finally, AllChoice is the combined task of choosing all inflectional and lexemic aspects of a word in context.",
        "This gives us a total of seven tasks.",
        "AllChoice is the hardest of our tasks, since it subsumes all other tasks.",
        "MorphAll is the hardest of the three morphological tagging tasks, subsuming MorphPart and MorphPOS, and DiacFull is the hardest lexical task, subsuming DiacPart, which in turn subsumes LexChoice.",
        "However, MorphAll and DiacFull are (in general) orthogonal, since MorphAll has no lex-emic component, while DiacFull does."

        "Our system, MADA, makes use of 19 orthogonal features to select, for each word, a proper analysis from a list of potential analyses provided by the BAMA dictionary.",
        "The BAMA analysis which matches the most of the predicted features wins; the weighting of the features is one of the topics of this paper.",
        "These 19 features consist of the 14 morphological features shown in Figure 1, which MADA predicts using 14 distinct Support Vector Machines trained on ATB3-Train (as defined by Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "In addition, MADA uses five additional features.",
        "Spellmatch determines whether the dia-critized form of the suggested analysis and the input word match if both are stripped of all of their diacritics.",
        "This is useful because sometimes BAMA suggests analyses which imply a different spelling of the undiacritized word, but these analyses are often incorrect.",
        "Isdefault identifies those analyses that are the default output of BAMA (typically, these are guesses that the word in question is a proper noun); these analyses are less likely to be correct than others suggested by BAMA.",
        "MADA can derive the values of Spellmatch and Isdefault by direct examination of the analysis in question, and no predictive model is needed.",
        "The fourteen morphological features plus Spellmatch and Isdefault form a feature collection that is entirely based on morphological (rather than lexemic) features; we refer to this collection as BASE-16.",
        "UnigramDiac and UnigramLex are unigram models of the surface diacritized form and the lexeme respectively, and contain lexical information.",
        "We also build 4-gram lexeme models using an open-vocabulary language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, by means of the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "The model is trained on the same corpus used to train the other classifiers, ATB3-Train.",
        "(We also tested other n-gram models, and found that a 4-gram lexeme model outperforms the other orders with n < 5, although the improvement over the trigram and 5-gram models was less than 0.01%.)",
        "The 4-gram model, on its own, correctly selects the lexeme of words in ATB3-DevTest 94.1% of the time.",
        "The 4-gram lexeme model was incorporated into our system as a full feature (NGRAM).",

        "In a preprocessing step, each analysis in appended with a set of labels which indicate whether the analysis is correct according to seven different evaluation metrics.",
        "These metrics correspond in a one-to-one manner to the seven different disambiguation tasks discussed in Section 2, and we use the task name for the evaluation label.",
        "Specifically, the MorphPOS label is positive if the analysis has the same POS value as the correct analysis in the gold standard; the LexChoice label provides the same information about the lexeme choice.",
        "The MorphPart label is positive if the analysis agrees with the gold for each of the 10 basic features used by Habash and Rambow (2005).",
        "A positive MorphAll label requires that the analysis match the gold in all morphological features, i.e., in every feature except the lexeme choice and diacritics.",
        "The DiacFull label is only positive if the surface diacritics of the analysis match the gold diacritics exactly; DiacPart is less strict in that the trailing sequence diacritic markers in each surface diacritic are stripped before the analysis and the gold are compared.",
        "Finally, AllChoice is only positive if the analysis was one chosen as correct in the gold; this is the strictest form of evaluation, and there can be only one positive AllChoice label per word.",
        "In addition to labeling as described in the preceding paragraph, we run MADA on the tuning and test sets.",
        "This gives us a set of model predictions for every feature of every word in the tuning and test sets.",
        "We use an implementation of a Downhill Simplex Method in many dimensions based on the method developed by Nelder and Mead (1965) to tune the weights applied to each feature.",
        "In a given iteration, the Simplex algorithm proposes a set offeature weights.",
        "These weights are given to a weight evaluation function; this function determines how effective a particular set of weights is at a given disambiguation task by calculating an overall score for the weight set: the number of words in the tuning set that were correctly disambiguated.",
        "In order to compute this score, the weight evaluation function examines each proposed analysis for each word in the tuning set.",
        "If the analysis and the model prediction for a feature of a given word agree, the analysis score for that analysis is incremented by the weight corresponding to that feature.",
        "The analysis with the highest analysis score is selected as the proper analysis for that word.",
        "If the selected analysis has a positive task label (i.e., it is a good answer for the disambiguation task in question), the overall score for the proposed weight set is incremented.",
        "The Simplex algorithm seeks to maximize this overall score (and thus choose the weight set that performs best for a given task).",
        "Once the Simplex algorithm has converged, the optimal feature weights for a given task are known.",
        "Our system makes use of these weights to select a correct analysis in the test set.",
        "Each analysis ofeach word is given a score that is the sum of optimal feature weights for features where the model prediction and the analysis agree.",
        "The analysis with the highest score is then chosen as the correct analysis for that word.",
        "The system can be evaluated simply by comparing the chosen analysis to the gold standard.",
        "Since the Simplex weight evaluation function and the system use identical means of scoring analyses, the Simplex algorithm has the potential to find very optimized weights."
