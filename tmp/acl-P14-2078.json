        "The Entity Linking (EL) task consists in linking name mentions of named entities (NEs) found in a document to their corresponding entities in a reference Knowledge Base (KB).",
        "These NEs can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), etc., and they are usually represented in the KB by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).",
        "Dealing with ambiguity is one of the key difficulties in this task, since mentions are often highly polysemous, and potentially related to many different KB entries.",
        "Various approaches have been proposed to solve the named entity disambiguation (NED) problem.",
        "Most of them involve the use of surface forms extracted from Wikipedia.",
        "Surface forms consist of a word or a group of words that match lexical units like Paris or New York City.",
        "They are used as matching sequences to locate corresponding candidate entries in the KB, and then to disambiguate those candidates using similarity measures.",
        "The NED problem is related to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem (Navigli, 2009), and is often more challenging since mentions of NEs can be highly ambiguous.",
        "For instance, names of places can be very common as is Paris, which refers to 26 different places in Wikipedia.",
        "Hence, systems that attempt to address the NED problem must include disambiguation resources.",
        "In the context of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, such resources can be generic and generative.",
        "This generative approach does not apply to the EL task where each entity to be linked to a semantic description has a specific word context, marker of its exact identity.",
        "One of the classical approach to conduct the disambiguation process in NED applications is to consider the context of the mention to be mapped, and compare this context with contextual information about the potential target entities (see for instance the KIM system (Popov et al., 2003)).",
        "This is usually done using similarity measures (such as cosine similarity, weighted Jaccard distance, KL divergence...) that evaluate the distance between a bag of words related to a candidate annotation, and the words surrounding the entity to annotate in the text.",
        "In more recent approaches, it is suggested that annotation processes based on similarity distance measures can be improved by making use of other annotations present in the same document.",
        "Such techniques are referred to as semantic relatedness (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), collective disambiguation (Hoffart et al., 2011b), or joint disambiguation (Fahrni et al., 2012).",
        "The idea is to evaluate in a set of candidate links which one is the most likely to be correct by taking the other links contained in the document into account.",
        "For example, if a NE describes a city name like Paris, it is more probable that the correct link for this city name designates Paris (France) rather than Paris (Texas) if a neighbor entity offers candidate links semantically related to Paris (France) like the Seine river or the Champs-Elys?ees.",
        "Such techniques mostly involve exploration of graphs resulting of all the candidate annotations proposed for a given document, and try to rank the best candidates for each annotation using an ontology.",
        "The ontology (like YAGO or DBPedia) provides a pre-476 existing set of potential relations between the entities to link (like for instance, in our previous exam-ple, Paris (France) has river Seine) that will be used to rank the best candidates according to their mutual presence in the document.",
        "In this paper we explore the capabilities of a disambiguation algorithm using all the available annotation layers of NEs to improve their links.",
        "The paper makes the following novel propositions: 1) the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of candidates is replaced by internal links and categories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coherence of entities is improved prior to the calculation of semantic relatedness using a co-reference resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough to improve the performance of existing entity linking annotation engines, which are capable of providing a set of ranked candidates for each annotation in a document.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes related works.",
        "The proposed method is presented in Section 3 where we explain how our SemLinker system prepares documents that contain mentions to disambiguate, then we detail the disambiguation algorithm.",
        "The evaluation of the complete system is provided in Section 4.",
        "Finally, we discuss the obtained results, and conclude.",
        "2 Related Work Entity annotation and linking in natural language text has been extensively studied in NLP research.",
        "A strong effort has been conducted recently by the TAC-KBP evaluation task (Ji et al., 2010) to create standardized corpus, and annotation standards based on Wikipedia for evaluation and comparison of EL systems.",
        "In this paper, we consider the TAC-KBP framework.",
        "We describe below some recent approaches proposed for solving the EL task.",
        "2.1 Wikipedia-based Disambiguation Methods The use of Wikipedia for explicit disambiguation dates back to (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006) who built a system that compared the context of a mention to the Wikipedia categories of an entity candidate.",
        "Lately, (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008; Nguyen and Cao, 2008) extended this framework by using richer features for similarity comparison.",
        "Some authors like Milne and Witten (2008) utilized machine learning methods rather than a similarity function to map mentions to entities.",
        "They also introduced the notion of semantic relatedness.",
        "Alternative propositions were suggested in other works like (Han and Zhao, 2009) that considered the relatedness of common noun phrases in a mention context with Wikipedia article names.",
        "While all these approaches focus on semantic relation between entities, their potential is limited by the separate mapping of candidate links for each mention.",
        "2.2 Semantic Web Compliant Methods More recently, several systems have been launched as web services dedicated to EL tasks.",
        "Most of them are compliant with new emergent semantic web standards like LinkedData network.",
        "DBPedia Spotlight (Mendes et al., 2011) is a system that finds mentions of DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) resources in a textual document.",
        "Wikimeta (Charton and Gagnon, 2012) is another system relying on DBpedia.",
        "It uses bags of words to disambiguate semantic entities according to a cosine similarity algorithm.",
        "Those systems have been compared with commercial ones like AlchemyAPI, Zemanta, or Open Calais in (Gangemi, 2013).",
        "The study showed that they perform differently on various essential aspects of EL tasks (mention detection, linking, disambiguation).",
        "This suggests a wide range of potential improvements on many aspects of the EL task.",
        "Only some of these systems introduce the semantic relatedness in their methods like the AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011b) system.",
        "It proposes a disambiguation method that combines popularity-based priors, similarity measures, and coherence.",
        "It relies on the Wikipedia-derived YAGO2 (Hoffart et al., 2011a) knowledge base.",
        "3 Proposed Algorithm We propose a mutual disambiguation algorithm that improves the accuracy of entity links in a document by using successive corrections applied to an annotation object representing this document.",
        "The annotation object is composed of information extracted from the document along with linguistic and semantic annotations as described hereafter.",
        "3.1 Annotation Object Documents are processed by an annotator capable of producing POS tags for each word, as well as spans, NE surface forms, NE labels and ranked candidate Wikipedia URIs for each candidate NE.",
        "For each document D, this knowledge is gathered 477 in an array called annotation object, which has initially one row per document lexical unit.",
        "Since the system focuses on NEs, rows with lexical units that do not belong to a NE SF are dropped from the annotation object, and NE SF are refined as described in (Charton et al., 2014).",
        "When NE SF are spanned over several rows, these rows are merged into a single one.",
        "Thus, we consider an annotation object A D , which is an array with a row for each NE, and columns storing related knowledge.",
        "If n NEs were annotated in D, then A D has n rows.",
        "If l candidate URIs are provided for each NE, then A D has (l + 4) columns c u,u?",
        "{1,l+4} .",
        "Columns c 1 to c l store Wikipedia URIs associated with NEs, ordered by decreasing values of likelihood.",
        "Column c l+1 stores the offset of the NEs, c l+2 stores their surface forms, c l+3 stores the NE labels (PER, ORG, ...), and c l+4 stores the (vec- tors of) POS tags associated with the NE surface forms.",
        "A D contains all the available knowledge about the NEs found inD.",
        "Before being processed by the disambiguation module,A D is dynamically updated by correction processes.",
        "3.2 Named Entity Label Correction To support the correction process based on co-reference chains, the system tries to correct NE labels for all the NEs listed in the annotation object.",
        "The NE label correction process assigns the same NE label to all the NEs associated with the same first rank URI.",
        "For all the rows inA D , sets of rows with identical first rank URIs are considered.",
        "Then, for each set, NE labels are counted per type, and all the rows in a same set are updated with the most frequent NE label found in the set, i.e. all the NEs in this set are tagged with this label.",
        "3.3 Correction Based on Co-reference Chains First rank candidate URIs are corrected by a process that relies on co-reference chains found in the document.",
        "The co-reference detection is conducted using the information recorded in the annotation object.",
        "Among the NEs present in the docu-ment, the ones that co-refer are identified and clustered by logical rules applied to the content of the annotation object.",
        "When a co-reference chain of NEs is detected, the system assigns the same URI to all the members of the chain.",
        "This URI is selected through a decision process that gives more weight to longer surface forms and frequent URIs.",
        "The following example illustrates an application of this correction process: Three sentences are extracted from a document about Paris, the French capital.",
        "NEs are indicated in brackets, first rank URIs and surface forms are added below the content of each sentence.",
        "- [Paris] is famous around the world.",
        "URI 1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris Hilton NE surface form: Paris The [city of Paris] attracts millions of tourists.",
        "URI 1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris NE surface form: city of Paris The [capital of France] is easy to reach by train.",
        "URI 1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris NE surface form: capital of France The three NEs found in these sentences compose a co-reference chain.",
        "The second NE has a longer surface form than the first one, and its associated first rank URI is the most frequent.",
        "Hence, the co-reference correction process will assign the right URI to the first NE (URI 1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris), which was wrongly linked to the actress Paris Hilton.",
        "3.4 Mutual Disambiguation Process The extraction of an accurate link is a process occurring after the URI annotation of NEs in the whole document.",
        "The system makes use of all the semantic content stored in A D to locally improve the precision of each URI annotation in the document.",
        "The Mutual Disambiguation Process (MDP) relies on the graph of all the relations (in- ternal links, categories) between Wikipedia content related to the document annotations.",
        "A basic example of semantic relatedness that should be captured is explained hereafter.",
        "Let us consider the mention IBM in a given document.",
        "Candidate NE annotations for this mention can be International Business Machine or International Brotherhood of Magicians.",
        "But if the IBM mention co-occurs with a Thomas Watson, Jr mention in the document, there will probably be more links between the International Business Machine and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages than between the International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages.",
        "The purpose of the MDP is to capture this semantic relatedness information contained in the graph of links extracted from Wikipedia pages related to each candidate annotation.",
        "In MDP, for each Wikipedia URI candidate an-notation, all the internal links and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related 478 to this URI are collected.",
        "This information will be used to calculate a weight for each of the l candidate URI annotations of each mention.",
        "For a given NE, this weight is expected to measure the mutual relations of a candidate annotation with all the other candidate annotations of NEs in the document.",
        "The input of the MDP is an annotation object A D with n rows, obtained as explained in Section 3.1.",
        "For all i ?",
        "[[1, n]], k ?",
        "[[1, l]], we build the set S k i , composed of the Wikipedia URIs and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related to the URI stored in A D [i][k] that we will refer to as URI k i to ease the reading.",
        "Scoring: For all i, j ?",
        "[[1, n]], k ?",
        "[[1, l]], we want to calculate the weight of mutual relations between the candidate URI k i and all the first rank candidates URI 1 j for j 6= i.",
        "The calculation combines two scores that we called direct semantic relation score (dsr score) and common semantic relation score (csr score): the dsr score for URI k i sums up the number of occurrences of URI k i in S 1 j for all j ?",
        "[[1, n]]?{i}.",
        "the csr score for URI k i sums up the number of common URIs and categories between S k i and S 1 j for all j ?",
        "[[1, n]]?",
        "{i}.",
        "We assumed the dsr score was much more semantically significant than the csr score, and translated this assumption in the weight calculation by introducing two correction parameters ?",
        "and ?",
        "used in the final scoring calculation.",
        "Re-ranking: For all i ?",
        "[[1, n]], for each set of URIs {URI k i , k ?",
        "[[1, l]]}, the re-ranking process is conducted according to the following steps: For all i ?",

        "[[1, l]]}, by decreasing order of mutual relation score.",
        "In the following, we detail the MDP in the context of a toy example to illustrate how it works.",
        "The document contains two sentences, NE mentions are in bold: IBM has 12 research laboratories worldwide.",
        "Thomas J. Watson, Jr. became president of the company.",
        "For the first NE mention [IBM], A D contains two candidate URIs identifying two different re-sources: [IBM] URI 1 1 ?",
        "International Brotherhood of Magicians URI 2 1 ?",
        "International Business Machines Corporation For the second NE mention [Thomas J. Watson, Jr.], A D contains the following candidate URI, which is ranked first: [Thomas J. Watson, Jr.] URI 1 2 ?",
        "Thomas Watson, Jr. S 1 1 gathers URIs and categories contained in the International Brotherhood of Magicians Wikipedia page.",
        "S 2 1 is associated to the International Business Machines Corporation, and S 1 2 to the Thomas Watson, Jr. page.",
        "dsr score(URI 1 1 ) sums up the number of occurrences of URI 1 1 in S 1 j for all j ?",
        "[[1, n]]?{1}.",
        "Hence, in the current example, dsr score(URI 1 1 ) is the number of occurrences of URI 1 1 in S 1 2 , namely the number of times the International Brotherhood of Magicians are cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr. page.",
        "Similarly, dsr score(URI 2 1 ) is equal to the number of times the International Business Machines Corporation is cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr. page.",
        "csr score(URI 1 1 ) sums up the number of common URIs and categories between S 1 1 and S 1 2 , i.e. the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr. pages.",
        "csr score(URI 2 1 ) counts the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Business Machines Corporation and Thomas Watson, Jr. pages.",
        "After calculation, we have: mutual relation score(URI 1 1 ) < mutual relation score(URI 2 1 ) The candidate URIs for [IBM] are re-ranked accordingly, and International Business Machines Corporation becomes its first rank candidate.",
