        "Along with computers penetrating in our daily life, the needs for the natural language generation (NLG) technology are increasing more and more.",
        "If computers understand both the meaning of a procedural text and the progression status, they can suggest us what to do next.",
        "In such situation they can show sentences describing the next instruction on a display or speak it.",
        "On this background we propose a method for generating instruction texts from a flow graph representation for a series of procedures.",
        "Among various genres of procedural texts, we choose cooking recipes, because they are one of the most familiar procedural texts for the public.",
        "In addition, a computerized help system proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2008) called smart kitchen is becoming more and more realistic.",
        "Thus we try to generate cooking procedural texts from a formal representation for a series of preparation instructions of a dish.",
        "As the formal representation, we adopt the flow graph representation (Hamada et al., 2000; Mori et al., 2014), in which the vertices and the arcs correspond to important objects ?His current affiliation is Cybozu Inc., Koraku 1-4- 14, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan.",
        "or actions in cooking and relationships among them, respectively.",
        "We use the flow graphs as the input and the text parts as the references for evaluation.",
        "Our generation method first automatically compiles a set of templates, which we call the skeleton pool, from a huge number of real procedural sentences.",
        "Then it decomposes the input flow graph into a sequence of subtrees that are suitable for a sentence.",
        "Finally it converts subtrees into natural language sentences.",
        "2 Recipe Flow Graph Corpus The input of our LNG system is the meaning representation (Mori et al., 2014) for cooking instructions in a recipe.",
        "A recipe consists of three parts: a title, an ingredient list, and sentences describing cooking instructions (see Figure 1).",
        "The meaning of the instruction sentences is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a root (the final dish) as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Its vertices have a pair of an important word sequence in the recipe and its type called a recipe named entity (NE)1.",
        "And its arcs denote relationships between them.",
        "The arcs are also classified into some types.",
        "In this paper, however, we do not use arc types for text generation, because we want our system to be capable of generating sentences from flow graphs output by an automatic video recognition system2 or those drawn by internet users.",
        "Each vertex of a flow graph has an NE composed of a word sequence in the text and its type such as food, tool, action, etc.",
        "Table 3 1Although the label set contains verb phrases, they are called named entities.",
        "2By computer vision techniques such as (Regneri et al., 2013) we may be able to figure out what action a person takes on what objects.",

        "The word sequences of verbal NEs do not include their inflectional endings.",
        "From the definition we can say that the content words are included in the flow graph representation.",
        "Thus an NLG system has to decide their order and generate the function words (including inflectional endings for verbs) to connect them to form a sentence.",

        "3.1 Skeleton Pool Compilation Before the run time, we first prepare a skeleton pool.",
        "A skeleton pool is a collection of skeleton sentences, or skeletons for short, and a skeleton is a sentence in which NEs have been replaced with NE tags.",

        "From the results shown in the table we can say that when we use 100,000 recipes for the skeleton compilation, our method can generate a sentence for 98.4% subtrees.",
        "And the table says that we can halve the number of uncovered subtrees by using about four times more sentences.",
        "The average number of the skeletons says that we have enough skeletons in average to try more sophisticated scoring functions.",
        "4.3 Text Quality To measure the quality of generated texts, we first calculated the BLEU (N = 4) (Papineni et al., 2002) with taking the original recipe texts as the references.",
        "The unit in our case is a sequence of sentences for a dish.",
        "Table 2 shows the average BLEU for all the test set.",
        "The result says that the more sentences we use for the skeleton pool compilation, the better the generated sentences become.",
        "The absolute BLEU score, however, does not tell much about the quality of generated texts.",
        "As it is well known, we can sometimes change the instruction order in dish preparation.",
        "Therefore we conducted a subjective evaluation in addition.",
        "We asked four evaluators to read 10 texts generated from 10 flow graphs and answer the following questions.",

        "How many ungrammatical two-word sequences does the text contain?",

        "The average of the answer to Q3 is 3.05.",
        "This result says that the dish will be partly the same as the original recipe.",
        "There is a room for improvement.",
        "Finally, let us take a look at the correlation of the result of three Qs with BLEU.",
        "The numbers of grammatical errors, i.e. the answers to Q1, has a stronger correlation with BLEU than those of Q2 asking the semantic quality.",
        "These are consistent with the intuition.",
        "The answer to Q3, asking overall text quality, has the strongest correlation with BLEU on average among all the questions.",
        "Therefore we can say that for the time being the objective evaluation by BLEU is sufficient to measure the performance of various improvements.",
        "5 Related Work Our method can be seen a member of template-based text generation systems (Re- iter, 1995).",
        "Contrary to the ordinary template-based approach, our method first automatically compiles a set of templates, which we call skeleton pool, by running an NE tagger on the real texts.",
        "This allows us to cope with the coverage problem with keeping the advantage of the template-based approach, ability to prevent from generating incomprehensible sentence structures.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to use an accurate NE tagger to convert sentences into skeletons, to show the coverages of the skeleton pool, and to evaluate the method in a realistic situation.",
        "Among many applications of our method, a concrete one is the smart kitchen (Hashimoto et al., 2008), a computerized cooking help system which watches over the chef by the computer vision (CV) technologies etc.",
        "and suggests the chef the next action to be taken or a good way of doing it in a casual manner.",
        "In this application, the text generation module make a sentence from a subtree specified by the process supervision module.",
        "There are some other interesting applica-tions: a help system for internet users to write good sentences, machine translation of a recipe in a different language represented as a flow graph, or automatic recipe generation from a cooking video based on CV and NLP researches such as (Regneri et al., 2013; Yamakata et al., 2013; Yu and Siskind, 2013).",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we explained and evaluated our method for generating a procedural text from a flow graph representation.",
        "The experimental results showed that our method is feasible especially when we have huge number of real sentences and that some more sophistications are possible to generate more natural sentences.",
