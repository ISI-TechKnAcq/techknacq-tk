        "Due to the globalisation of research, the English language is today the universal language of scientific communication.",

        "This situation forces researchers to frequently translate their own articles, lectures, presentations, reports, and abstracts between English and French.",
        "In addition, students and the general public are also challenged by language, when it comes to find published articles in English or to understand these articles.",
        "Finally, international scientists not even consider to look for French publications (for instance PhD theses) because they are not available in their native languages.",
        "This problem, incorrectly resolved through the use of generic translation tools, actually reveals an interesting generic problem where a community of specialists are regularly performing translations tasks on a very limited domain.",
        "At the same time, other communities of users seek translations for the same type of documents.",
        "Without appropriate tools, the expertise and time spent for translation activity by the first community is lost and do not benefit to translation requests of the other communities.",
        "We propose the demonstration of an end-to-end tool for enabling efficient translation for scientific texts.",
        "This system, developed for the COSMAT ANR project,1 is closely integrated into the HAL open archive,2 a multidisciplinary open-access archive which was created in 2006 to archive publications from all the French scientific community.",
        "The tool deals with handling of source document format, generally a pdf file, specialised translation of the content, and user-friendly user-interface allowing to post-edit the output.",

        "the scene, the post-editing tool captures user post-editing data which are used to incrementally improve the translations engines.",
        "The only equipment required by this demonstration is a computer with an Internet browser installed and an Internet connection.",
        "In this paper, we first describe the complete work-flow from data acquisition to final post-editing.",
        "Then we focus on the text extraction procedure.",
        "In Section 4, we give details about the translation system.",
        "Then in section 5, we present the translation and post-editing interface.",
        "We finally give some concluding remarks.",
        "The system will be demonstrated at EACL in his tight integration with the HAL paper deposit system.",
        "If the organizers agree, we would like to offer the use of our system during the EACL conference.",
        "It would automatically translate all the abstracts of the accepted papers and also offers the possibility to correct the outputs.",
