      "text": [
        "One of the most exciting recent developments in computational linguistics is that large-scale grammars which compute semantic representations are becoming available.",
        "Examples for such grammars are the HPSG English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000) and the LFG Par-Gram grammars (Butt et al., 2002); a similar resource is being developed for the XTAG grammar (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004).",
        "But with the advent of such grammars, a phenomenon that is sometimes considered a somewhat artificial toy problem of theoretical semanticists becomes a very practical challenge: the presence of scope ambiguities.",
        "Because grammars often uniformly treat noun phrases as quantifiers, even harmless-looking sentences can have surprisingly many readings.",
        "The median number of scope readings for the sentences in the Rondane Treebank (distributed with the ERG) is 55, but the treebank also contains extreme cases such as (1) below, which according to the ERG has about 2.4 trillion (1012) readings: (1) Myrdal is the mountain terminus of the Flåm rail line (or Flåmsbana) which makes its way down the lovely Flåm Valley (Flåmsdalen) to its sea-level terminus at Flåm.",
        "(Rondane 650) In order to control such an explosion of readings (and also to simplify the grammar design process), the developers of large-scale grammars typically use methods of packing or underspecification to specify the syntax-semantics interface.",
        "The general idea is that the parser doesn’t compute all the individual scope readings, but only a compact underspecified description, from which the individual readings can then be extracted at a later stage of processing – but the underspecified description could also be used as a platform for the integration of lexical and context information, so as to restrict the set of possible readings without enumerating the wrong ones.",
        "Such an approach is only feasible if we have access to efficient tools that support the most important operations on underspecified descriptions.",
        "We present utool, the Swiss Army Knife of Underspecification, which sets out to do exactly this.",
        "It supports the following operations:",
        "1. enumerate all scope readings represented by an underspecified description; 2. check whether a description has any readings, and compute how many readings it has without explicitly enumerating them; 3. convert underspecified descriptions between different underspecification formalisms (at this point, Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2003), Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996), and dominance constraints/graphs (Egg et al., 2001; Althaus et al., 2003)).",
        "Our system is the fastest solver for underspecifi-cied description available today; that is, it is fastest at solving Task 1 above (about 100.000 readings per second on a modern PC).",
        "It achieves this by implementing an efficient algorithm for solving dominance graphs (Bodirsky et al., 2004) and caching intermediate results in a chart data structure.",
        "To our knowledge, it is the only system that can do Tasks 2 and 3.",
        "It is only because utool can compute the number of readings without enumerating them that we even know that (1) has trillions of readings; even utool would take about a year to enumerate and count the readings individually.",
        "utool is implemented in C++, efficient and portable, open source, and freely downloadable from http://utool.sourceforge.net."

      "text": [
        "At the core of utool is a solver for dominance graphs (Bodirsky et al., 2004) – graph representations of weakly normal dominance constraints, which constitute one of the main formalisms used in scope underspecification (Egg et al., 2001; Althaus et al., 2003).",
        "Dominance graphs are directed graphs with two kinds of edges, tree edges and dominance edges.",
        "They can be used to describe the set of all trees into which their tree edges can be embedded, in such a way that every dominance edge in the graph is realised as reachability in the tree.",
        "Dominance graphs are used as underspecified descriptions by describing sets of trees that are encodings of the formulas of some language of semantic representations, such as predicate logic.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 shows an example of a constraint graph for the sentence “every student reads a book.” It consists of five tree fragments – sets of nodes that are connected by (solid) tree edges – which are connected by dominance edges (dotted lines).",
        "Two of the fragments have two holes each, into which other fragments can be “plugged”.",
        "The graph can be embedded into the two trees shown in the middle of Fig. 1, which correspond to the two readings of the sentence.",
        "By contrast, the graph cannot be embedded into the tree shown on the right: a dominance edge stipulates that “readx,y” must be reachable from “somey”, but it is not reachable from “somey” in the tree.",
        "We call the two trees into which the graph can be embedded its solutions.",
        "The Bodirsky et al.",
        "algorithm enumerates the solutions of a dominance graph (technically, its solved forms) by computing the set of its free fragments, which are the fragments that can occur at the root of some solution.",
        "Then it picks one of these fragments as the root and removes it from the graph.",
        "This splits the graph into several connected subgraphs, which are then solved recursively.",
        "This algorithm can call itself for the same sub-graph several times, which can waste a lot of time because the set of all solutions was already computed for the subgraph on the first recursive call.",
        "For this reason, our implementation caches intermediate results in a chart-like data structure.",
        "This data structure maps each subgraph G to a set of splits, each of which records which fragment of G should be placed at the root of the solution, what the subgraphs after removal of this fragment are, and how their solutions should be plugged into the holes of the fragment.",
        "In the worst case, the chart can have exponential size; but in practice, it is much smaller than the set of all solutions.",
        "For example, the chart for (1) contains 74.960 splits, which is a tiny number compared to the 2.4 trillion readings, and can be computed in a few seconds.",
        "Now solving becomes a two-phase process.",
        "In the first phase, the chart data structure is filled by a run of the algorithm.",
        "In the second phase, the complete solutions are extracted from the chart.",
        "Although the first phase is conceptually much more complex than the second one because it involves interesting graph algorithms whose correctness isn’t trivial to prove, it takes only a small fraction of the entire runtime in practice.",
        "Instead of enumerating all readings from the chart, we can also compute the number of solutions represented by the chart.",
        "For each split, we compute the numbers of solutions of the fragment sets in the split.",
        "Then we multiply these numbers (choices for the children can be combined freely).",
        "Finally, we obtain the number of solutions for a subgraph by adding the numbers of solutions of all its splits.",
        "This computation takes linear time in the size of the chart."

        "One of the most significant obstacles in the development of tools and resources for scope underspecification is that different resources (such as grammars and solvers) are built for different underspecification formalisms.",

        "The input and output functionality is provided by codecs, which translate between descriptions in one of these formalisms and the internal dominance graph format.",
        "The codecs for MRS and Hole Semantics are based on the (non-trivial) translations in (Koller et al., 2003; Niehren and Thater, 2003) and are only defined on nets, i.e. constraints whose graphs satisfy certain structural restrictions.",
        "This is not a very limiting restriction in practice (Flickinger et al., 2005).",

        "From a more general perspective, the real appeal of underspecification is that it could allow us to eliminate readings that contradict the context or our world knowledge, without having to enumerate these readings first.",
        "Such inferences could already take place on the level of the underspecified description (Koller and Niehren, 2000).",
