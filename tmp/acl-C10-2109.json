        "We refer to tasks such as these as task-embedded machine translation, since the performance of the system as a whole depends on both task performance and the quality of the machine translation (MT).",

        "However, even if answer extraction is done in Arabic, errorful translations of the correct answer can affect precision: if the user cannot understand the translated English sentence, the result will be perceived irrelevant.",
        "For instance, the user may not realize that the mistranslation \"Alry$Awy\" refers to Al-Rishawi.",
        "Our goal was not to improve a specific CLQA system, but rather to find MT errors that are likely to impact CLQA and correct them.",

        "The CLQA system translates the full corpus, containing 119,879 text documents and 150 hours of speech, offline using a production MT system, which is able to translate quickly (5,000 words per minute) at the cost of lower quality translations.",
        "A research MT system has higher quality but is too slow to be practical for a large amount of data (at 2 words per minute, it would take 170 days on 50 machines to translate the corpus).",
        "At query-time, we can call the research MT system to retranslate sentences, but due to time constraints, we can only retranslate k sentences (we set k=25).",
        "In order to choose the sentences to best improve CLQA performance, we rank potential sentences using a relevance model and a model of error importance.",
        "Our results touch on three areas:",

        "• Evaluation of the impact of re-ranking shows that it is crucial for directing scarce MT resources wisely as the higher-ranked sentences were more relevant.",
        "• Although the research MT system was perceived to be significantly better than the production system, evaluation shows that it corrected the detected errors only 39% of the time.",
        "Furthermore, retranslation seems to have a negligible effect on relevance.",
        "These unexpected results indicate that, while we can identify errors, retranslation is not a good approach for correcting them.",

        "Of the sentences with better perceived MT, 7% increased in relevance, and 3% decreased in relevance.",
        "When the retranslated sentence was considered worse, there was a 2% increased in relevance and a 4% decrease.",
        "In other words, when retranslation had a positive effect, it more often led to increased relevance.",
        "However, the impact of retranslation was mixed, and none of the changes was statistically significant.",
        "While the extrinsic evaluation focused on the impact on CLQA relevance, the goal of the intrinsic evaluation was to measure the precision of the error detection algorithm, and whether retranslation addressed the detected errors.",

        "All of the OOV tokens were content words (except for one disagreement).",

        "The CLQA evaluation was based on three hypotheses:",
        "• That we could detect errors in MT with high precision.",
        "• That retranslating errorful sentences with a much better MT system would correct the errors we detected.",
        "• That correcting errors would cause some sentences to become relevant which were not previously relevant, as in (Ma and McK-",
        "eown, 2009).",
        "The intrinsic evaluation confirmed that we can identify content word deletions in MT with high precision, thus validating the first hypothesis.",
        "However, detecting the errors and retranslating them did not lead to large improvements in CLQA relevance - the impact of increased perceived adequacy on relevance was mixed and not significant.",
        "The intrinsic evaluation explains this negative result: even though the retranslated sentences were judged significantly better, the retranslation only corrected the detected error 39% of the time.",
        "In other words, the better research MT system was making many of the same mistakes as the production MT system, despite using syntactic features and a much deeper search space during decoding.",
        "Since the second hypothesis did not hold, we need to improve our error correction algorithm before we can tell whether the third hypothesis holds.",
        "This result directly motivates the need for targeted error correction of MT.",
        "Automatic MT post-editing has been successfully used for selecting determiners (Knight and Chander, 1994), reinserting deleted verbs (Ma and McKeown, 2009), correcting NE translations (Parton et al., 2008), and lexical substitutions (Elming, 2006).",
        "Since Arabic and English word order differ significantly, straightforward reinsertion of the deleted words is not sufficient for error correction, so we are currently working on more sophisticated post-editing techniques."

      "heading": "9. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We presented a novel online algorithm for detecting MT errors in the context of a question, and a heuristic for ranking MT errors by their potential impact on the CLQA task.",
        "The error detection algorithm focused on content word deletion, which has previously been shown to be a significant problem in SMT.",
        "The algorithm is generally applicable to any MT system that produces word or phrase alignments for its output and any language pair that can be POS-tagged, and it is more fine-grained and covers more types of errors than previous work.",
        "It was able to detect errors in Arabic-English MT across multiple text and speech genres, and the intrinsic evaluation showed that the large majority of tokens flagged as errors were indeed content words.",
        "The large-scale CLQA evaluation confirmed that the slower research MT system was significantly better than the production MT system.",
        "Relevance judgments showed that the ranking component was crucial for directing scarce MT resources wisely, as the higher-ranked sentences were most likely to be relevant to the query, and therefore most likely to benefit the CLQA system by being retranslated.",
        "Although we correctly identified MT errors, retranslating the sentences with the errors had a negligible effect on CLQA relevance.",
        "This unexpected result may be explained by the fact that only 39% of the errors were actually corrected by the research MT system, so re-translation was not a good approach for error correction.",
        "We are currently working on correcting content word deletion in MT via post-editing.",
        "Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Radu Florian, Salim Roukos, Vittorio Castelli, Dan Bikel and the whole GALE IBM team for providing the experimental testbed, including the CLQA and MT systems.",
