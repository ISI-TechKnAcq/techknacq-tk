        "In recent years, nlg evaluation has taken on a more comparative character.",
        "nlg now has evaluation results for comparable, but independently developed systems, including results for systems that regenerate the Penn Treebank (Langkilde, 2002) and systems that generate weather forecasts (Belz and Reiter, 2006).",
        "The growing interest in comparative evaluation has also resulted in a tentative interest in shared-task evaluation events, which led to the first such event for nlg (the Attribute Selection for Generation of Referring Expressions, or asgre, Challenge) in 2007 (Belz and Gatt, 2007), with a second event (the Referring Expression Generation, or reg, Challenge) currently underway.",
        "In hlt in general, comparative evaluations (and shared-task evaluation events in particular) are dominated by intrinsic evaluation methodologies, in contrast to the more extrinsic evaluation traditions of nlg.",
        "In this paper, we present research in which we applied both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods to the same task, in order to shed light on how the two correlate for nlg tasks.",
        "The results show a surprising lack of correlation between the two types of measures, suggesting that intrinsic metrics and extrinsic methods can represent two very different views of how well a system performs."

        "reg research goes back at least to the 1980s (Appelt, Grosz, Joshi, McDonald and others), but the field as it is today was shaped in particular by Dale and Reiter's work (Dale, 1989; Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "reg tends to be divided into the stages of attribute selection (selecting properties of entities) and realisation (converting selected properties into word strings).",
        "Attribute selection in its standard formulation was the shared task in the asgre Challenge: given an intended referent ('target') and the other domain entities ('dis-tractors') each with possible attributes, select a set of attributes for the target referent.",

        "Each data item is a paired attribute set (as derived from a human-produced re) and domain representation (target and distractor entities represented as possible attributes and values).",

        "To enable subjects to read the outputs of peer systems, we converted them from the attribute-value format described above to something more readable, using a simple attribute-to-word converter.",
        "Both experiments used a Repeated Latin Squares design, and involved 30 participants and 2,250 individual trials (see Belz & Gatt (2007) for full details).",
        "In Exp 1, subjects were shown the domain on the same screen as the description.",
        "Two dependent measures were used: (i) combined reading and identification time (rit), measured from the point at which the description and pictures appeared on the screen to the point at which a picture was selected by mouse-click; and (ii) error rate (ER-1).",
        "In Exp 2, subjects first read the description and then initiated the presentation of domain entities.",
        "We computed: (i) reading time (RT), measured from the presentation of a description to the point where a subject requested the presentation of the domain; (ii) identification time (it), measured from the presentation of the domain to the point where a subject clicked on a picture; and (iii) error rate (ER-2).",

        "REG-specific intrinsic measures: Uniqueness is the proportion of attribute sets generated by a system which identify the referent uniquely (i.e. none of the distractors).",
        "Minimality is the proportion of attribute sets which are minimal as well as unique (i.e. there is no smaller unique set of attributes).",
        "These measures were included because they are commonly named as desiderata for attribute selection algorithms in the reg field (Dale, 1989).",
        "The minimality check used in this paper treats referent type as a simple attribute, as the asgre systems tended to do.",

        "This is an unambiguous result and it shows clearly that similarity to human-produced reference texts is not necessarily indicative of quality as measured by human task performance.",
        "The emergence of comparative evaluation in nlg raises the broader question of how systems that generate language should be compared.",
        "In mt and summarisation it is more or less taken as read that systems which generate more human-like language are better systems.",
