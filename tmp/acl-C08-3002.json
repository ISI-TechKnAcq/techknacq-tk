        "Grammar checking is one of the most widely used tools within natural language engineering applications.",
        "Most of the word processing systems available in the market incorporate spelling, grammar, and style-checking systems for English and other widely used languages.",
        "Naber (2003) discussed one such rule-based grammar checking system for English.",
        "However, when it comes to the smaller languages, specifically the Indian languages, most of such advanced tools have been lacking.",
        "Although, spell checking has been addressed for most of the Indian languages, still grammar and style checking systems are lacking.",
        "In this article, a grammar checking system for Punjabi has been provided.",
        "Punjabi is a member of the Modern Indo-Aryan family of languages.",
        "There is an n-gram based grammar checking system for Bangla (Alam et al., 2006).",
        "However, the authors admit that its accuracy is very low and there is no description about whether the system provides any suggestions to correct errors or not.",
        "However, the system that we discuss here for Punjabi detects errors and suggests corrections as well.",
        "While doing so, it provides enough information for the user to understand the error reason and the suggestions provided, if any."

        "The purpose of the system is to find various grammatical mistakes in the formal texts written in Punjabi language.",
        "While detecting grammatical mistakes, the focus is on keeping the false alarms to minimum.",
        "For every detected error, system provides enough information for the user to understand why the error is being marked.",

        "• It can be used with various information processing systems for Punjabi, where the input needs to be corrected grammatically before processing.",
        "• Parts of this system like morphological analyzer, morphological generator, part-of-speech tagger, phrase chunker etc., will find use in almost every natural language processing application like machine translation, text to speech synthesis, and search engines etc., for Punjabi.",
        "• This system as a whole can be used as a post editor for a number of applications for Punjabi like machine translation, optical character recognition etc., where the output needs to be corrected grammatically before providing the end results.",
        "• Second language learners of Punjabi can use this system as a writing aid to learn grammatical categories operating in Punjabi sentences, and thus improve their writings by learning from their mistakes.",
        "• In the word processing field, this system can be used for checking essays, formal reports, and letters written in Punjabi."

      "text": [
        "The design of this grammar checking is provided below in figure 1.",
        "A sketchy idea of this proposed design is provided below in terms of how the input text is processed to find potential grammatical errors.",
        "For grammar checking, the input text is first given to a preprocessor, which breaks the input text into sentences and then into words.",
        "It also performs filtering, i.e. marks any phrases, fixed expressions etc.",
        "in the text.",
        "Then the tokenized text is passed on to a morphological analyzer, which uses a full form lexicon to assign each word its all possible part-of-speech (POS) information (i.e. POS tags).",
        "Then the text along with the POS tags moves on to a POS tagger, which attempts to disambiguate the information using handwritten disambiguation rules.",
        "Then this POS tagged text is passed on to a phrase chunker, which builds phrases using handwritten phrase chunking rules targeted at the POS tag information.",
        "Phrase chunker also marks clause boundaries and headwords in noun phrases and clauses.",
        "Then in the last stage, syntax/agreement checks are performed based on the grammatical information (exhibited by POS tags) at the phrase level and then at the clause level, using the marked headwords.",
        "Any discrepancy found is reported to the user along with the suggested corrections and detailed error information.",
        "All the sub activities of this grammar checking system are fully automated and have been designed exclusively from scratch as part of this work.",
        "No such sub system was available for Punjabi for our use.",
        "All the sub activities have been implemented in Microsoft Visual C# 2005 and the databases are in XML format with Punjabi text in Unicode.",

        "Output text with suggestions",
        "For the purpose of morphological analysis, we have divided the Punjabi words into 22 word classes depending on the grammatical information required for the words of these word classes.",
        "The information that is in the database depends upon the word class, like for noun and inflected adjective, it is gender, number, and case.",
        "As mentioned earlier, all the word forms of the commonly used Punjabi words are kept in the lexicon along with their root and other grammatical information.",
        "For part-of-speech tagging, we have devised a tag set keeping into mind all the grammatical categories that can be helpful for agreement checking.",
        "The tag set is very user friendly and while choosing tag names existing tag sets for English and other such languages were taken into consideration, like NNMSD - masculine, singular, and direct case noun, PNPMPOF masculine, plural, oblique case, and first person personal pronoun.",
        "The approach followed for part-of-speech tagging is rule-based, as there is no tagged corpus for Punjabi available at present.",
        "The part-of-speech tagging rules take into account the potential grammatical agreement errors.",
        "For phrase chunking, again a rule-based approach was selected.",
        "The tag set that is being used for phrase chunking includes tags like NPD - noun phrase in direct case, NPNE - noun phrase followed by ?",
        "ne etc.",
        "The rules for phrase chunking take into account the potential errors in the text, like lack of agreement in words of a potential phrase.",
        "In the last phase i.e. error checking, there are manually designed error detection rules to detect potential errors in the text and provide corrections to resolve those errors.",
        "For example, rule to check modifier and noun agreement, will go through all the noun phrases in a sentence to check if the modifiers of those sentences agree with their respective headwords (noun/pronoun) in terms of gender, number, and case or not.",
        "For this matching, the grammatical information from the tags of modifiers and headwords is used.",
        "In simple terms, it will compare the grammatical information (gender, number, and case) of modifier with the headword (noun/pronoun) and displays an error message if some grammatical information fails to match.",
        "To resolve this error, the error checking module will use morphological generator to generate the correct form (based on headword's gender, number, and case) for that modifier from its root word.",
        "For example, consider the grammatically incorrect sentence «a°e Tfe J sohne larka janda hai 'handsome boy goes'.",
        "In this sentence, in the noun phrase «a°e sohne larka 'handsome boy', the modifier sohne 'handsome' (root word - tijf sohna 'handsome'), with masculine gender, plural number, and direct case, is not in accordance with the gender, number, and case of its headword larka 'boy'.",
        "It should be in singular number instead of plural.",
        "The grammar checking module will detect this as an error as 'number' for modifier and headword is not same, then it will use morphological generator to generate the 'singular number form' from its root word, which is same as root form i.e. sohna 'handsome' (masculine gender, singular number, and direct case).",
        "So, the input sentence will be corrected as tijf «a°e Tfe J sohna larka janda hai 'handsome boy goes'."
