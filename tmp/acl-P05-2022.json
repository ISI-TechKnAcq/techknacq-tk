        "It is now an acknowledged fact that alignment of parallel corpora at the word and phrase level plays a major role in bilingual linguistic resource extraction and machine translation.",
        "There are basically two kinds of systems working at these segmentation levels: the most widespread rely on statistical models, in particular the IBM ones (Brown et al., 1993); others combine simpler association measures with different kinds of linguistic information (Arhenberg et al., 2000; Barbu, 2004).",
        "Mainly dedicated to machine translation, purely statistical systems have gradually been enriched with syntactic knowledge (Wu, 2000; Yamada & Knight, 2001; Ding et al., 2003; Lin & Cherry, 2003).",
        "As pointed out in these studies, the introduction of linguistic knowledge leads to a significant improvement in alignment quality.",
        "In the method described hereafter, syntactic information is the kernel of the alignment process.",
        "Indeed, syntactic dependencies identified on both sides of English/French bitexts with a parser are used to discover correspondences between words.",
        "This approach has been chosen in order to capture frequent alignments as well as sparse and/or corpus-specific ones.",
        "Moreover, as stressed in previous research, using syntactic dependencies seems to be particularly well suited to coping with the problem of linguistic variation across languages (Hwa et al., 2002).",
        "The implemented procedure is referred to as “syntax-based propagation”."

      "text": [
        "The idea is to make use of dependency relations to align words (Debili & Zribi, 1996).",
        "The reasoning is as follows (Figure 1): if there is a pair of anchor words, i.e. if two words w1i (community in the example) and w2m (communauté) are aligned at the sentence level, and if there is a dependency relation between w1i (community) and w1j (ban) on the one hand, and between w2m (communauté) and w2n (interdire) on the other hand, then the alignment link is propagated from the anchor pair (community, communauté) to the syntactically connected words (ban, interdire)."
