        "We aim at two types of participants:",
        "1.",
        "People who understand the basic idea of statistical machine translation and want to get a survey of hot-topic current research, in terms that they can understand.",
        "2.",
        "People associated with statistical machine translation work, who have not had time to study the most current topics in depth.",
        "We fill the gap between the introductory tutorials that have gone before and the detailed scientific papers presented at ACL sessions."
