        "A mechanism is introduced to incorporate the prior information about polarity-bearing words obtained from existing sentiment lexicons into latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) where sentiment labels are considered as topics.",
        "Experiments on Chinese product reviews on mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, and monitors demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that the weakly supervised LDA model performs as well as supervised classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Support vector Machines with an average of 83% accuracy achieved over a total of 5484 review documents.",
        "Moreover, the LDA model is able to extract highly domain-salient polarity words from text."

        "It has become a hot topic in recent years because of the explosion in availability of people's attitudes and opinions expressed in social media including blogs, discussion forums, tweets, etc.",
        "Research in sentiment analysis has mainly focused on the English language.",
        "There have been few studies in sentiment analysis in other languages due to the lack of resources, such as subjectivity lexicons consisting of a list of words marked with their respective polarity (positive, negative or neutral) and manually labeled subjectivity corpora with documents labeled with their polarity.",
        "Pilot studies on cross-lingual sentiment analysis utilize machine translation to perform sentiment analysis on the English translation of foreign language text (Banea et al., 2008; Bautin et al., 2008; Wan, 2009).",
        "The major problem is that they cannot be generalized well when there is a domain mismatch between the source and target languages.",
        "There have also been increasing interests in exploiting bootstrapping-style approaches for weakly-supervised sentiment classification in languages other than English (Zagibalov and Carroll, 2008b; Zagibalov and Carroll, 2008a; Qiu et al., 2009).",
        "Other approaches use ensemble techniques by either combining lexicon-based and corpus-based algorithms (Tan et al., 2008) or combining sentiment classification outputs from different experimental settings (Wan, 2008).",
        "Nevertheless, all these approaches are either complex or require careful tuning of domain and data specific parameters.",
        "This paper proposes a weakly-supervised approach for Chinese sentiment classification by incorporating language-specific lexical knowledge obtained from available English sentiment lexicons through machine translation.",
        "Unlike other cross-lingual sentiment classification methods which often require labeled corpora for training and therefore hinder their applicability for cross-domain sentiment analysis, the proposed approach does not require labeled documents.",
        "Moreover, as opposed to existing weakly-supervised sentiment classification approaches which are rather complex, slow, and require careful parameter tuning, the proposed approach is simple and computationally efficient; rendering more suitable for online and real-time sentiment classification from the Web.",
        "Our experimental results on the Chinese reviews of four different product types show that the LDA model performs as well as the supervised classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines trained from labeled corpora.",
        "Although this paper primarily studies sentiment analysis in Chinese, the proposed approach is applicable to any other language so long as a machine translation engine is available between the selected language and English.",

        "Pilot studies on cross-lingual sentiment analysis rely on English corpora for subjectivity classification in other languages.",
        "For example, Mihal-cea et al.",
        "(2007) make use of a bilingual lexicon and a manually translated parallel text to generate the resources to build subjectivity classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes (NB) in a new language; Banea et al.",
        "(2008) use machine translation to produce a corpus in a new language and train SVMs and NB for subjectivity classification in the new language.",
        "Bautin et al.",
        "(2008) also utilize machine translation to perform sentiment analysis on the English translation of a foreign language text.",
        "More recently, Wan (2009) proposed a co-training approach to tackle the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification by leveraging an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification.",
        "Similar to the approach proposed in (Banea et al., 2008), Wan's method also uses machine translation to produced a labeled Chinese review corpus from the available labeled",
        "English review data.",
        "However, in order to alleviate the language gap problem that the underlying distributions between the source and target language are different, Wan builds two SVM classifiers, one based on English features and the other based on Chinese features, and uses a bootstrapping method based on co-training to iteratively improve classifiers until convergence.",
        "The major problem of the aforementioned cross-lingual sentiment analysis algorithms is that they all utilize supervised learning to train sentiment classifiers from annotated English corpora (or the translated target language corpora generated by machine translation).",
        "As such, they cannot be generalized well when there is a domain mismatch between the source and target language.",
        "For example, For example, the word 'compact' might express positive polarity when used to describe a digital camera, but it could have negative orientation if it is used to describe a hotel room.",
        "Thus, classifiers trained on one domain often fail to produce satisfactory results when shifting to another domain.",
        "Recent efforts have also been made for weakly-supervised sentiment classification in Chinese.",
        "Zagibalov and Carroll (2008b) starts with a one-word sentiment seed vocabulary and use iterative retraining to gradually enlarge the seed vocabulary by adding more sentiment-bearing lexical items based on their relative frequency in both the positive and negative parts of the current training data.",
        "Sentiment direction of a document is then determined by the sum of sentiment scores of all the sentiment-bearing lexical items found in the document.",
        "The problem with this approach is that there is no principal way to set the optimal number of iterations.",
        "They then suggested an iteration control method in (Zagibalov and Carroll, 2008a) where iterative training stops when there is no change to the classification of any document over the previous two iterations.",
        "However, this does not necessarily correlate to the best classification accuracy.",
        "Similar to (Zagibalov and Carroll, 2008b), Qiu et al.",
        "(2009) also uses a lexicon-based iterative process as the first phase to iteratively enlarge an initial sentiment dictionary.",
        "But instead of using a one-word seed dictionary as in (Za-gibalov and Carroll, 2008b), they started with a much larger HowNet Chinese sentiment dictionary as the initial lexicon.",
        "Documents classified by the first phase are taken as the training set to train the SVMs which are subsequently used to revise the results produced by the first phase.",
        "Other researchers investigated ensemble techniques for weakly-supervised sentiment classification.",
        "Tan et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a combination of lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches that first labels some examples from a give domain using a sentiment lexicon and then trains a supervised classifier based on the labeled ones from the first stage.",
        "Wan (2008) combined sentiment scores calculated from Chinese product reviews using the Chinese HowNet sentiment dictionary and from the English translation of Chinese reviews using the English MPQA subjectivity lexicon.",
        "Various weighting strategies were explored to combine sentiment classification outputs from different experimental settings in order to improve classification accuracy.",
        "Nevertheless, all these weakly-supervised sentiment classification approaches are rather complex and require either iterative training or careful tuning of domain and data specific parameters, and hence unsuitable for online and real-time sentiment analysis in practical applications."

      "text": [
        "Unlike existing approaches, we view sentiment classification as a generative problem that when an author writes a review document, he/she first decides on the overall sentiment or polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a document, then for each sentiment, decides on the words to be used.",
        "We use LDA to model a mixture of only three topics or sentiment labels, i.e. positive, negative and neutral.",
        "Assuming that we have a total number of S sentiment labels; a corpus with a collection of D documents is denoted by C = {d\\, d2,dD}; each document in the corpus is a sequence of Ndwords denoted by d = (wi,w2,...,wNd), and each word in the document is an item from a vocabulary index with V distinct terms denoted by {1,2,V}.",
        "The generative process is as follows:",
        "• Choose distributions p ~ Dir(ß).",
        "• For each document d G [1, D], choose distributions nd ~ Dir (7).",
        "lt ~ Multinomial(nd), and then choose a word wt ~ Multinomial(plt).",
        "The joint probability of words and sentiment label assignment in LDA can be factored into two terms:",
        "Letting the superscript – t denote a quantity that excludes data from the tth position, the conditional posterior for lt by marginalizing out the random variables p and n is where Nwt k is the number of times word wt has associated with sentiment label k; Nk is the the number of times words in the corpus assigned to sentiment label k; Nk d is the number of times sentiment label k has been assigned to some word tokens in document d; Nd is the total number of words in the document collection.",
        "Each words in documents can either bear positive polarity (lt = 1), or negative polarity (lt = 2), or is neutral (lt = 0).",
        "We now show how to incorporate polarized words in sentiment lexicons as prior information in the Gibbs sampling process.",
        "Let",
        "• For each of the Nd word position wt, choose a sentiment label",
        "We can then modify the Gibbs sampling equation as follows:",
        "where the function S(wt) returns the prior sentiment label of wt in a sentiment lexicon and it is defined if word wt is found in the sentiment lexicon.",
        "1I(k = S(wt)) is an indicator function that takes on value 1 if k = S(wt) and 0 otherwise.",
        "Equation 4 in fact applies a hard constraint that when a word is found in a sentiment lexicon, its sampled sentiment label is restricted to be the same as its prior sentiment label defined in the lexicon.",
        "This constraint can be relaxed by introducing a parameter to control the strength of the constraint such that when word wt is found in the sentiment lexicon, Equation 4 becomes where 0 < X < 1.",
        "When X = 1, the hard constraint will be applied; when X = 0, Equation 5 is reduced to the original unconstrained Gibbs sampling as defined in Equation 2.",
        "While sentiment prior information is incorporated by modifying conditional probabilities used in Gibbs sampling here, it is also possible to explore other mechanisms to define expectation or posterior constraints, for example, using the generalized expectation criteria (McCallum et al., 2007) to express preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words.",
        "We leave the exploitation of other mechanisms of incorporating prior knowledge into model training as future work.",
        "The document sentiment is classified based on P(l|d), the probability of sentiment label given document, which can be directly obtained from the document-sentiment distribution.",
        "We define that a document d is classified as positive if P(lpos|d) > P(lneg|d), and vice versa."

        "This paper has proposed a mechanism to incorporate prior information about polarity words from English sentiment lexicons into LDA model learning for weakly-supervised Chinese sentiment classification.",
        "Experimental results of sentiment classification on Chinese product reviews show that in the absence of a language-specific sentiment lexicon, the translated English lexicons can still produce satisfactory results with the sentiment classification accuracy of 81% achieved averaging over four different types of product reviews.",
        "With the incorporation of the Chinese sentiment lexicon NTUSD, the classification accuracy is further improved to 83%.",

        "One issue relating to the proposed approach is that it still depends on the quality of machine translation and the performance of sentiment classification is thus affected by the language gap between the source and target language.",
        "A possible way to alleviate this problem is to construct a language-specific sentiment lexicon automatically from data and use it as the prior information source to be incorporated into the LDA model learning."
