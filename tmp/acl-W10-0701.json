        "Ipeirotis (2010) reports that just over half of Turkers have a college education.",
        "Despite being reasonably well educated, it is important to keep in mind that Turkers do not have training in specialized subjects like NLP.",
        "Because the Turkers are non-experts, and because the payments are generally so low, quality control is an important consideration when creating data with MTurk.",
        "Amazon provides three mechanisms to help ensure quality:",
        "• Requesters have the option of rejecting the work of individual Turkers, in which case they are not paid.",
        "Turkers can also be blocked from doing future work for a requester.",
        "• Requesters can specify that each HIT should be redundantly completed by several different Turkers.",
        "This allows higher quality labels to be selected, for instance, by taking the majority",
        "label.",
        "• Requesters can require that all workers meet a particular set of qualifications, such as sufficient accuracy on a small test set or a minimum percentage of previously accepted submissions.",
        "Amazon provides two qualifications that a Requester can use by default.",
        "These are past HIT Approval Rate and Location.",
        "The location qualification allows the Requester to have HITs done only by residents of a certain country (or to exclude Turk-ers from certain regions).",
        "Additionally, Requesters can design custom Qualification Tests that Turkers must complete before working on a particular HIT.",
        "These can be created through the MTurk API, and can either be graded manually or automatically.",
        "An important qualification that isn't among Amazon's default qualifications is language skills.",
        "One might design a qualification test to determine a Turker's ability to speak Arabic or Farsi before allowing them to do part of speech tagging in those languages, for instance.",
        "There are several reasons that poor quality data might be generated.",
        "The task may be too complex or the instructions might not be clear enough for Turk-ers to follow.",
        "The financial incentives may be too low for Turkers to act conscientiously, and certain HIT designs may allow them to simply randomly click instead of thinking about the task.",
        "Mason and Watts (2009) present a study of financial incentives on Mechanical Turk and find, counterintuitively, that increasing the amount of compensation for a particular task does not tend to improve the quality of the results.",
        "Anecdotally, we have observed that sometimes there is an inverse relationship between the amount of payment and the quality of work, because it is more tempting to cheat on high-paying HITs if you don't have the skills to complete them.",
        "For example, a number of Turkers tried to cheat on an Urdu to English translation HIT by cutting-and-pasting the Urdu text into an online machine translation system (expressly forbidden in the instructions) because we were paying the comparatively high amount of $1.",
        "We suggest designing your HITs in a way that will deter cheating or that will make cheating obvious.",
        "HIT design is part of the art of using MTurk.",
        "It can't be easily quantified, but it has a large impact on the outcome.",
        "For instance, we reduced cheating on our translation HIT by changing the design so that we displayed images of the Urdu sentences instead of text, which made it impossible to copy-and-paste into an MT system for anyone who could not type in Arabic script.",
        "Another suggestion is to include information within the data that you upload to MTurk that will not be displayed to the Turkers, but will be useful to you when reviewing the HITs.",
        "For example, we include machine translation output along with the source sentences.",
        "Although this is not displayed to Turkers, when we review the Turkers' translations we compare them to the MT output.",
        "This allows us to reject translations that are identical to the MT, or which are just random sentences that are unrelated to the original Urdu.",
        "We also use a javascript to gather the IP addresses of the Turkers and do geolocation to look up their location.",
        "Turkers in Pakistan require less careful scrutiny since they are more likely to be bilingual Urdu speakers than those in Romania, for instance.",
        "CrowdFlower provides an interface for designing HITs that includes a phase for the Requester to input gold standard data with known labels.",
        "Inserting items with known labels alongside items which need labels allows a Requester to see which Turkers are correctly replicating the gold standard labels and which are not.",
        "This is an excellent idea.",
        "If it is possible to include positive and negative controls in your HITs, then do so.",
        "Turkers who fail the controls can be blocked and their labels can be excluded from the final data set.",
        "CrowdFlower-generated HITs even display a score to the Turkers to give them feedback on how well they are doing.",
        "This provides training for Turkers, and discourages cheating.",
        "http://wiki.github.com/callison-burch/ mechanical_turk_workshop/geolocation http://crowdflower.com/",
        "Another class of quality control on Mechanical Turk is through iterative HITs that build on the output of previous HITs.",
        "This could be used to have Turkers judge whether the results from a previous HIT conformed to the instructions, and whether it is of high quality.",
        "Alternately, the second set of Turkers could be used to improve the quality of what the first Turk-ers created.",
        "For instance, in a translation task, a second set of US-based Turkers could edit the English produced by non-native speakers.",

        "First and foremost, it is critical to convey instructions appropriately for non-experts.",
        "The instructions should be clear and concise.",
        "To calibrate whether the HIT is doable, you should first try the task yourself, and then have a friend from outside the field try it.",
        "This will help to ensure that the instructions are clear, and to calibrate how long each HIT will take (which ought to allow you to price the HITs fairly).",
        "If possible, you should insert positive and negative controls so that you can quickly screen out bad Turkers.",
        "This is especially important for HITs that only require clicking buttons to complete.",
        "If possible, you should include a small amount of gold standard data in each HIT.",
        "This will allow you to determine which Turkers are good, but will also allow you weight the Turkers if you are combining the judgments of multiple Turkers.",
        "If you are having Turkers evaluate the output of systems, then randomize the order that the systems are shown in.",
        "When publishing papers that use Mechanical Turk as a source of training data or to evaluate the output of an NLP system, report how you ensured the quality of your data.",
        "You can do this by measuring the inter-annotator agreement of the Turkers against experts on small amounts of gold standard data, or by stating what controls you used and what criteria you used to block bad Turkers.",
        "Finally, whenever possible you should publish the data that you generate on Mechanical Turk (and your analysis scripts and HIT templates) alongside your paper so that other people can verify it."

        "4 annotators for each of the 100 announcements identified 3 types of medical entities: medical conditions, medications, and laboratory test.",
        "The most popular shared task topic was Machine Translation (MT).",
        "MT is a data hungry task that relies on huge corpora of parallel texts between two languages.",
        "Performance of MT systems depends on the size of training corpora, so there is a constant search for new and larger data sets.",
        "Such data sets are traditionally expensive to produce, requiring skilled translators.",
        "One of the advantages to MTurk is the diversity of the Turker population, making it an especially attractive source of MT data.",
        "Shared task papers in MT explored the full range of MT tasks, including alignments, parallel corpus creation, paraphrases and bilingual lexicons.",
        "Gao and Vogel (2010) create alignments in a 300 sentence Chinese-English corpus (Chinese aligned to English).",
        "Both Ambati and Vogel (2010) and Bloodgood and Callison-Burch (2010) explore the potential of MTurk in the creation of MT parallel corpora for evaluation and training.",
        "Bloodgood and Callison-Burch replicate the NIST 2009 Urdu-English test set of 1792 sentences, paying only $0.10 a sentence, a substantially reduced price than the typical annotator cost.",
        "The result is a data set that is still effective for comparing MT systems in an evaluation.",
        "Ambati and Vogel create corpora with 100 sentences and 3 translations per sentence for all the language pairs between English, Spanish, Urdu and Telugu.",
        "This demonstrates the feasibility of creating cheap corpora for high and low resource languages.",
        "Two papers focused on the creation and evaluation of paraphrases.",
        "Denkowski et al.",
        "(2010) generated and evaluated 728 paraphrases for Arabic-English translation.",
        "MTurk was used to identify correct and fix incorrect paraphrases.",
        "Over 1200 high quality paraphrases were created.",
        "Buzek et al.",
        "(2010) evaluated error driven paraphrases for MT.",
        "In this setting, paraphrases are used to simplify potentially difficult to translate segments of text.",
        "Turkers identified 1780 error regions in 1006 English/Chinese sentences.",
        "Turkers provided 4821 paraphrases for these regions.",
        "External resources can be an important part of an MT system.",
        "Irvine and Klementiev (2010) created lexicons for low resource languages.",
        "They evaluated translation candidates for 100 English words in 32 languages and solicited translations for 10 additional languages.",
        "Higgins et al.",
        "(2010) expanded name lists in Arabic by soliciting common Arabic nicknames.",
        "The 332 collected nicknames were primarily provided by Turkers in Arab speaking countries (35%), India (46%), and the United States (13%).",
        "Finally, Zaidan and Ganitkevitch (2010) explored how MTurk could be used to directly improve an MT grammar.",
        "Each rule in an Urdu to English translation system was characterized by 12 features.",
        "Turk-ers were provided examples for which their feedback was used to rescore grammar productions directly.",
        "This approach shows the potential of fine tuning an MT system with targeted feedback from annotators."

      "text": [
        "Looking ahead, we can't help but wonder what impact MTurk and crowdsourcing will have on the speech and language research community.",
        "Keeping in mind Niels Bohr's famous exhortation \"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future,\" we attempt to draw some conclusions and predict future directions and impact on the field.",
        "Some have predicted that access to low cost, highly scalable methods for creating language and speech annotations means the end of work on unsupervised learning.",
        "Many a researcher has advocated his or her unsupervised learning approach because of annotation costs.",
        "However, if 100 examples for any task are obtainable for less than $100, why spend the time and effort developing often inferior unsupervised methods?",
        "Such a radical change is highly debatable, in fact, one of this paper's authors is a strong advocate of such a position while the other disagrees, perhaps because he himself works on unsupervised methods.",
        "Certainly, we can agree that the potential exists for a change in focus in a number of ways.",
        "In natural language processing, data drives research.",
        "The introduction of new large and widely accessible data sets creates whole new areas of research.",
        "There are many examples of such impact, the most famous of which is the Penn Treebank (Marcus.",
        "et al., 1994), which has 2910 citations in Google scholar and is the single most cited paper on the ACL anthology network (Radev et al., 2009).",
        "Other examples include the CoNLL named entity corpus (Sang and Meulder (2003) with 348 citations on Google Scholar), the IMDB movie reviews sentiment data (Pang et al.",
        "(2002) with 894 citations) and the Amazon sentiment multi-domain data (Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) with 109 citations) .",
        "MTurk means that creating similar data sets is now much cheaper and easier than ever before.",
        "It is highly likely that new MTurk produced data sets will achieve prominence and have significant impact.",
        "Additionally, the creation of shared data means more comparison and evaluation against previous work.",
        "Progress is made when it can be demonstrated against previous approaches on the same data.",
        "The reduction of data cost and the rise of independent corpus producers likely means more accessible data.",
        "More than a new source for cheap data, MTurk is a source for new types of data.",
        "Several of the papers in this workshop collected information about the annotators in addition to their annotations.",
        "This creates potential for studying how different user demographics understand language and allow for targeting specific demographics in data creation.",
        "Beyond efficiencies in cost, MTurk provides access to a global user population far more diverse than those provided by more professional annotation settings.",
        "This will have a significant impact on low resource languages as corpora can be cheaply built for a much wider array of languages.",
        "As one example, Irvine and Klementiev (2010) collected data for 42 languages without worrying about how to find speakers of such a wide variety of languages.",
        "Additionally, the collection of Arabic nicknames requires a diverse and numerous Arabic speaking population (Higgins et al., 2010).",
        "In addition to extending into new languages, MTurk also allows for the creation of evaluation sets in new genres and domains, which was the focus of two papers in this workshop (Finin et al., 2010; Yetisgen-Yildiz et al., 2010).",
        "We expect to see new research emphasis on low resource languages and new domains and genres.",
        "Another factor is the change of data type and its impact on machine learning algorithms.",
        "With professional annotators, great time and care are paid to annotation guidelines and annotator training.",
        "These are difficult tasks with MTurk, which favors simple intuitive annotations and little training.",
        "Many papers applied creative methods of using simpler annotation tasks to create more complex data sets.",
        "This process can impact machine learning in a number of ways.",
        "Rather than a single gold standard, annotations are now available for many users.",
        "Learning across multiple annotations may improve systems (Dredze et al., 2009).",
        "Additionally, even with efforts to clean up MTurk annotations, we can expect an increase in noisy examples in data.",
        "This will push for new more robust learning algorithms that are less sensitive to noise.",
        "If we increase the size of the data tenfold but also increase the noise, can learning still be successful?",
        "Another learning area of great interest is active learning, which has long relied on simulated user experiments.",
        "New work evaluated active learning methods with real users using MTurk (Baker et al., 2009; Ambati et al., 2010; Hsueh et al., 2009; ?).",
        "Finally, the composition of complex data set annotations from simple user inputs can transform the method by which we learn complex outputs.",
        "Current approaches expect examples of labels that exactly match the expectation of the system.",
        "Can we instead provide lower level simpler user annotations and teach systems how to learn from these to construct complex output?",
        "This would open more complex annotation tasks to MTurk.",
        "A general trend in research is that good ideas come from unexpected places.",
        "Major transformations in the field have come from creative new approaches.",
        "Consider the Penn Treebank, an ambitious and difficult project of unknown potential.",
        "Such large changes can be uncommon since they are often associated with high cost, as was the Penn Treebank.",
        "However, MTurk greatly reduces these costs, encouraging researchers to try creative new tasks.",
        "For example, in this workshop Tong et al.",
        "(2010) collected handwriting samples in multiple languages.",
        "Their creative data collection may or may not have a significant impact, but it is unlikely that it would have been tried had the cost been very high.",
        "Finally, while obtaining new data annotations from MTurk is cheap, it is not trivial.",
        "Workshop participants struggled with how to attract Turkers, how to price HITs, HIT design, instructions, cheating detection, etc.",
        "No doubt that as work progresses, so will a communal knowledge and experience of how to use MTurk.",
        "There can be great benefit in new toolkits for collecting language data using MTurk, and indeed some of these have already started to emerge (Lane et al., 2010)."
