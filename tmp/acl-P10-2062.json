        "Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007) address this problem by asking human annotators to mark (at least some of) the relevant text spans that support each document-level sentiment decision.",
        "The text spans of these \"rationales\" are then used to construct additional training examples that can guide the learning algorithm toward better categorization models.",
        "But could we perhaps enjoy the performance gains of rationale-enhanced learning models without any additional human effort whatsoever (beyond the document-level sentiment label)?",
        "We hypothesize that in the area of sentiment analysis, where there has been a great deal of recent research attention given to various aspects of the task (Pang and Lee, 2008), this might be possible: using existing resources for sentiment analysis, we might be able to construct annotator rationales automatically.",
        "In this paper, we explore a number of methods to automatically generate rationales for document-level sentiment classification.",
        "In particular, we investigate the use of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis components and lexicons for this purpose.",
        "Our approaches for generating annotator rationales can be viewed as mostly unsupervised in that we do not require manually annotated rationales for training.",
        "Rather unexpectedly, our empirical results show that automatically generated rationales (91.78%) are just as good as human rationales (91.61%) for document-level sentiment classification of movie reviews.",
        "In addition, complementing the human annotator rationales with automatic rationales boosts the performance even further for this domain, achieving 92.5% accuracy.",
        "We further evaluate our rationale-generation approaches on product review data for which human rationales are not available: here we find that even randomly generated rationales can improve the classification accuracy although rationales generated from sentiment resources are not as effective as for movie reviews.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly summarize the SVM-based learning approach of Zaidan et al.",

        "(2007) first introduced the notion of annotator rationales – text spans highlighted by human annotators as support or evidence for each document-level sentiment decision.",
        "These rationales, of course, are only useful if the sentiment categorization algorithm can be extended to exploit the rationales effectively.",
        "With this in mind, Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007) propose the following con trastive learning extension to the standard SVM learning algorithm.",
        "Let Xi be movie review i, and let {fj j be the set of annotator rationales that support the positive or negative sentiment decision for Xi.",
        "For each such rationale fj in the set, construct a contrastive training example vj, by removing the text span associated with the rationale fj from the original review Xi.",
        "Intuitively, the contrastive example vj should not be as informative to the learning algorithm as the original review Xi, since one of the supporting regions identified by the human annotator has been deleted.",
        "That is, the correct learned model should be less confident of its classification of a contrastive example vs. the corresponding original example, and the classification boundary of the model should be modified accordingly.",
        "Zaidan et al.",

        "Our goal in the current work, is to generate annotator rationales automatically.",
        "For this, we rely on the following two assumptions:",
        "(1) Regions marked as annotator rationales are more subjective than unmarked regions.",
        "(2) The sentiment of each annotator rationale coincides with the document-level sentiment.",
        "Note that assumption 1 was not observed in the Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007) work: annotators were asked only to mark a few rationales, leaving other (also subjective) rationale sections unmarked.",
        "And at first glance, assumption (2) might seem too obvious.",
        "But it is important to include as there can be subjective regions with seemingly conflicting sentiment in the same document (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "For instance, an author for a movie review might express a positive sentiment toward the movie, while also discussing a negative sentiment toward one of the fictional characters appearing in the movie.",
        "This implies that not all subjective regions will be relevant for the document-level sentiment classification – rather only those regions whose polarity matches that of the document should be considered.",
        "In order to extract regions that satisfy the above assumptions, we first look for subjective regions in each document, then filter out those regions that exhibit a sentiment value (i.e., polarity) that conflicts with polarity of the document.",
        "Assumption 2 is important as there can be subjective regions with seemingly conflicting sentiment in the same document (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "Because our ultimate goal is to reduce human annotation effort as much as possible, we do not employ supervised learning methods to directly learn to identify good rationales from human-annotated rationales.",
        "Instead, we opt for methods that make use of only the document-level sentiment and off-the-shelf utilities that were trained for slightly different sentiment classification tasks using a corpus from a different domain and of a different genre.",
        "Although such utilities might not be optimal for our task, we hoped that these basic resources from the research community would constitute an adequate source of sentiment information for our purposes.",
        "We next describe three methods for the automatic acquisition of rationales.",
        "The first approach employs OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005a), an off-the-shelf opinion analysis utility.",
        "In particular, OpinionFinder identifies phrases expressing positive or negative opinions.",
        "Because OpinionFinder models the task as a word-based classification problem rather than a sequence tagging task, most of the identified opinion phrases consist of a single word.",
        "In general, such short text spans cannot fully incorporate the contextual information relevant to the detection of subjective language (Wilson et al., 2005a).",
        "Therefore, we conjecture that good rationales should extend beyond short phrases.",
        "For simplicity, we choose to extend OpinionFinder phrases to sentence boundaries.",
        "In addition, to be consistent with our second operating assumption, we keep only those sentences whose polarity coincides with the document-level polarity.",
        "In sentences where OpinionFinder marks multiple opinion words with opposite polarities we perform a simple voting – if words with positive (or negative) polarity dominate, then we consider the entire sentence as positive (or negative).",
        "We ignore sentences with a tie.",
        "Each selected sentence is considered as a separate rationale.",
        "Unfortunately, domain shift as well as task mismatch could be a problem with any opinion utility based on supervised learning.",
        "Therefore, we next consider an approach that does not rely on supervised learning techniques but instead explores the use of a manually constructed polarity lexicon.",
        "In particular, we use the lexicon constructed for Wilson et al.",
        "(2005b), which contains about 8000 words.",
        "Each entry is assigned one of three polarity values: positive, negative, neutral.",
        "We construct rationales from the polarity lexicon for every instance of positive and negative words in the lexicon that appear in the training corpus.",
        "As in the OpinionFinder rationales, we extend the words found by the PolarityLexicon approach to sentence boundaries to incorporate potentially relevant contextual information.",
        "We retain as rationales only those sentences whose polarity coincides with the document-level polarity as determined via the voting scheme of Section 3.1.",
        "Finally, we generate annotator rationales randomly, selecting 25% of the sentences from each document and treating each as a separate rationale.",
        "Before evaluating the performance of the automatically generated rationales, we summarize in Table 1 the differences between automatic vs. human-generated rationales.",
        "All computations were performed on the same movie review dataset of Pang and Lee (2004) used in Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Note, that the Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007) annotation guidelines did not insist that annotators mark all rationales, only that some were marked for each document.",
        "Nevertheless, we report precision, recall, and F-score based on overlap with the human-annotated rationales of Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007), so as to demonstrate the degree to which the proposed approaches align with human intuition.",
        "Overlap measures were also employed by",
        "Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "As shown in Table 1, the annotator rationales found by OpinionFinder (F-score 49.5%) and the PolarityLexicon approach (F-score 52.6%) match the human rationales much better than those found by random selection (F-score 27.3%).",
        "As expected, OpinionFinder's positive rationales match the human rationales at a significantly lower level (F-score 31.9%) than negative rationales (59.5%).",
        "This is due to the fact that Opinion-Finder is trained on a dataset biased toward negative sentiment (see Section 3.1 - 3.2).",
        "In contrast, all other approaches show a balanced performance for positive and negative rationales vs. human rationales."
