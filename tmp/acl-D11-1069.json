        "In the 1990's, the natural language processing community shifted much of its attention to corpus-based learning techniques.",
        "Since then, most of the text corpora that have been annotated and studied are collections of expository text (e.g., news articles, scientific literature, etc.).",
        "The intent of expository text is to present or explain information to the reader.",
        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in text genres that originate from Web sources, such as weblogs and social media sites (e.g., tweets).",
        "These text genres offer new challenges for NLP, such as the need to handle informal and loosely grammatical text, but they also pose new opportunities to study discourse and pragmatic phenomena that are fundamentally different in these genres.",
        "Message boards are common on the WWW as a forum where people ask questions and post comments to members of a community.",
        "They are typically devoted to a specific topic or domain, such as finance, genealogy, or Alzheimer's disease.",
        "Some message boards offer the opportunity to pose questions to domain experts, while other communities are open to anyone who has an interest in the topic.",
        "From a natural language processing perspective, message board posts are an interesting hybrid text genre because they consist of both expository text and conversational text.",
        "Most obviously, the conversations appear as a thread, where different people respond to each other's questions in a sequence of posts.",
        "Studying the conversational threads, however, is not the focus of this paper.",
        "Our research addresses the issue of conversational pragmatics within individual message board posts.",
        "Most message board posts contain both expository sentences as well as speech acts.",
        "The person posting a message (the \"writer\") often engages in speech acts with the readers.",
        "The writer may explicitly greet the readers (\"Hi everyone!",
        "\"), request help from the readers (\"Anyone have a suggestion?",
        "\"), or commit to a future action ( \"I promise I will report back soon.\").",
        "But most posts contain factual information as well, such as general knowledge or personal history describing a situation, experience, or predicament.",
        "Our research goals are twofold: (1) to distinguish between expository sentences and speech act sentences in message board posts, and (2) to classify speech act sentences into four types: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives, following Searle's original taxonomy (Searle, 1976).",
        "Speech act classification could be useful for many applications.",
        "Information extraction systems could benefit from filtering speech act sentences (e.g., promises and questions) so that facts are only extracted from the expository text.",
        "Identifying Directive sentences could be used to summarize the questions being asked in a forum over a period of time.",
        "Representative sentences could be extracted to highlight the conclusions and beliefs of domain experts in response to a question.",
        "In this paper, we present sentence classifiers that can identify speech act sentences and classify them as Commissive, Directive, Expressive, and Representative.",
        "First, we explain how each speech act class is manifested in message board posts, which can be different from how they occur in spoken dialogue.",
        "Second, we train classifiers to identify speech act sentences using a variety of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.",
        "Finally, we evaluate our system on a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine."

        "For the purposes of defining and evaluating our work, we created detailed annotation guidelines for four of Searle's speech act classes that commonly occur in message board posts: Commissives, Directives, Expressives, and Representatives.",
        "We omitted the fifth of Searle's original speech act classes, Declarations, because we virtually never saw declarative speech acts in our data set.",
        "The data set used in our study is a collection of message board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.",
        "We designed our definitions and guidelines to reflect language use in the text genre of message board posts, trying to be as domain-independent as possible so that these definitions should also apply to message board texts representing other topics.",
        "However, we give examples from the veterinary domain to illustrate how these speech act classes are manifested in our data set.",
        "Commissives: A Commissive speech act occurs when the speaker commits to a future course of action.",
        "In conversation, common Commissive speech acts are promises and threats.",
        "In message boards, these types of Commissives are relatively rare.",
        "However, we found many statements where the main purpose was to confirm to the readers that the writer would perform some action in the future.",
        "For example, a doctor may write \"Iplan to do surgery on this patient tomorrow\" or \"I will post the test results when I get them later today\" .",
        "We viewed such statements as implicit commitments to the reader about intended actions.",
        "We also considered decisions not to take an action as Commissive speech acts (e.g., \"I will not do surgery on this cat because it would be too risky.\"",
        ").",
        "However, statements indicating that an action will not occur because of circumstances beyond the writer's control were considered to be factual statements and not speech acts (e.g., \"I cannot do an ultrasound because my machine is broken.\"",
        ").",
        "Directives: A Directive speech act occurs when the speaker expects the listener to do something as a response.",
        "For example, the speaker may ask a question, make a request, or issue an invitation.",
        "Directive speech acts are common in message board posts, especially in the initial post of each thread when the writer explicitly requests help or advice regarding a specific topic.",
        "Many Directive sentences are posed as questions, so they are easy to identify by the presence of a question mark.",
        "However, the language in message board forums is informal and often ungrammatical, so many Directives are posed as a question but do not end in a question mark (e.g., \"What do you think.\").",
        "Furthermore, many Directive speech acts are not stated as a question but as a request for assistance.",
        "For example, a doctor may write \"I need your opinion on what drug to give this patient.\"",
        "Finally, some sentences that end in question marks are rhetorical in nature and do not represent a Directive speech act, such as \"Can you believe that?",
        "\".",
        "Expressives: An Expressive speech act occurs in conversation when a speaker expresses his or her psychological state to the listener.",
        "Typical cases are when the speaker thanks, apologizes, or welcomes the listener.",
        "Expressive speech acts are common in message boards because writers often greet readers at the beginning of a post (\"Hi everyone!\"",
        ") or express gratitude for help from the readers (\"I really appreciate the suggestions.\"",
        ").",
        "We also found Expressive speech acts in a variety of other contexts, such as apologies.",
        "Representatives: According to Searle, a Representative speech act commits the speaker to the truth of an expressed proposition.",
        "It represents the speaker's belief of something that can be evaluated to be true or false.",
        "These types of speech acts were less common in our data set, but some cases did exist.",
        "In the veterinary domain, we considered sentences to be a Representative speech act when a doctor explicitly confirmed a diagnosis or expressed their suspicion or hypothesis about the presence (or absence) of a disease or symptom.",
        "For example, if a doctor writes that \"I suspect the patient has pancreatitis.\"",
        "then this represents the doctor's own proposition/belief about what the disease might be.",
        "Many sentences in our data set are stated as fact but could be reasonably inferred to be speech acts.",
        "For example, suppose a doctor writes \"The cat has pancreatitis.\"",
        ".",
        "It would be reasonable to infer that the doctor writing the post diagnosed the cat with pancreatitis.",
        "And in many cases, that is true.",
        "However, we saw many posts where that inference would have been wrong.",
        "For example, the following sentence might say \"The cat was diagnosed by a previous vet but brought to me due to new complications\" or \"The cat was diagnosed with it 8 years ago as a kitten in the animal shelter\" .",
        "Consequently, we were very conservative in labelling sentences as Representative speech acts.",
        "Any sentence presented as fact was not considered to be a speech act.",
        "A sentence was only labelled as a Representative speech act if the writer explicitly expressed his belief.",
        "To create speech act classifiers, we designed a variety of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.",
        "We tried to capture linguistic properties associated with speech act expressions as well as discourse properties associated with individual sentences and the message board post as a whole.",
        "We also incorporated speech act word lists that were acquired from external resources, and used two types of semantic features to represent semantic entities associated with the veterinary domain.",
        "Except for the semantic features, all of our features are domain-independent so should be able to recognize speech act sentences across different domains.",
        "We experimented with domain-specific semantic features to test our hypothesis that Commissive speech acts can be associated with domain-specific semantic entities.",
        "For the purposes of analysis, we partition the feature set into three groups: Lexical and Syntactic (LexSyn) Features, Speech Act Clue Features, and Semantic Features.",
        "Unless otherwise noted, all of the features had binary values indicating the presence or absence of that feature.",
        "We designed a variety of features to capture lexical and syntactic properties of words and sentences.",
        "We described the feature set below, with the features categorized based on the type of information that they capture.",
        "Unigrams: We created bag-of-word features representing each unigram in the training set.",
        "Numbers were replaced with a special # token.",
        "Personal Pronouns: We defined three features to look for the presence of a 1st person pronoun, 2nd person pronoun, and 3rd person pronoun.",
        "We included the subjective, objective, and possessive form of each pronoun (e.g., he, him, and his).",
        "Tense: Speech acts such as Commissives can be related to tense.",
        "We created three features to identify verb phrases that occur in the past, present, or future tense.",
        "To recognize tense, we followed the rules defined by Allen (1995).",
        "Tense + Person: We created four features that require the presence of a first person subjective pronoun (I, we) within a two word window on the left of a verb phrase matching one of four tense representations: past, present, future, and present progressive (a subset of the more general present tense representation).",
        "Modals: One feature indicates whether the sentence contains a modal (may, must, shall, will, might, should, would, could).",
        "Infinitive VP: One feature looks for an infinitive verb phrase ('to' followed by a verb) that is preceded by a first person pronoun (I, we) within a three word window on the left.",
        "This feature tries to capture common Commissive expressions (e.g., \"I definitely plan to do the test tomorrow.\"",
        ").",
        "Plan Phrases: Commissives are often expressed as a plan, so we created a feature that recognizes four types of plan expressions: \"I am going to\" , \"I am planning to\", \"Iplan to\", and \"My plan is to\".",
        "Sentence contains Early Punctuation: One feature checks for the following punctuation marks within the first three tokens of the sentence: , : !",
        "This feature was designed to recognize greetings, such as: \"Hi,\" , or \"Hiya everyone !",
        "\".",
        "Sentence begins with Modal/Verb: One feature checks if a sentence begins with a modal or verb.",
        "The intuition is to capture interrogative and imperative sentences, since they are likely to be Directives.",
        "Sentence begins with WH Question: One feature checks if a sentence begins with a WH question word (Who, When, Where, What, Which, What, How).",
        "Neighboring Question: One feature checks whether the following sentence contains a question mark '?'.",
        "We observed that in message boards, Directives often occur in clusters.",
        "Sentence Position: Four binary features represent the relative position of the sentence in the post.",
        "One feature indicates whether it is the first sentence, one feature indicates whether it is the last sentence, one feature indicates whether it is the second to last sentence, and one feature indicates whether the sentence occurs in the bottom 25% of the message.",
        "The motivation for these features is that Expressives often occur at the beginning and end of the post, and Directives tend to occur toward the end.",
        "Number of Verbs: One feature represents the number of verbs in the sentence using four possible values: 0, 1, 2, >2.",
        "Some speech acts classes (e.g., Expressives) may occur with no verbs, and rarely occur in long, complex sentences.",
        "We collected speech act word lists (mostly verbs) from two external sources.",
        "In Searle's original paper (Searle, 1976), he listed words that he considered to be indicative of speech acts.",
        "We discarded a few that we considered to be overly general, and we added a few additional words.",
        "We also collected a list of speech act verbs published in (Wierzbicka, 1987).",
        "The details for these speech act clue lists are given below.",
        "Our system recognized all derivations of these words.",
        "Searle Keywords: We created one feature for each speech act class.",
        "The Representative keywords were: (hypothesize, insist, boast, complain, conclude, deduce, diagnose, and claim).",
        "We discarded 3 words from Searle's list (suggest, call, believe) and added 2 new words, assume and suspect.",
        "The Directive keywords were: (ask, order, command, request, beg, plead, pray, entreat, invite, permit, advise, dare, defy, challenge).",
        "We added the word please.",
        "The Expressives keywords were: (thank, apologize, congratulate, condole, deplore, welcome).",
        "We added the words appreciate and sorry.",
        "Searle did not provide any hint on possible indicator words for Commissives, so we manually defined five likely Commissive keywords: (plan, commit, promise, tomorrow, later).",
        "Wierzbicka Verbs: We created one feature that included 228 speech act verbs listed in the book \"English speech act verbs: a semantic dictionary\" (Wierzbicka, 1987).",
        "All of the previous features are domain-independent and should be useful for identifying speech acts sentences across many domains.",
        "However, we hypothesized that semantic entities may correlate with speech acts within a particular domain.",
        "For example, consider medical domains.",
        "Representative speech acts may involve diagnoses and hypotheses regarding diseases and symptoms.",
        "Similarly, Commissive speech acts may reveal a doctor's plan or intention regarding the administration of drugs or tests.",
        "Thus, it may be beneficial for a classifier to know whether a sentence contains certain semantic entities.",
        "We experimented with two different sources of semantic information.",
        "Semantic Lexicon: Basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002) is a bootstrapping algorithm that has been used to induce semantic lexicons for terrorist events (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), biomedical concepts (McIntosh, 2010), and subjective/objective nouns for opinion analysis (Riloff et al., 2003).",
        "We ran Basilisk over our collection of 15,383 veterinary message board posts to create a semantic lexicon for veterinary medicine.",
        "As input, Basilisk requires seed words for each semantic category.",
        "To obtain seeds, we parsed the corpus using a noun phrase chunker, sorted the head nouns by frequency, and manually identified the 20 most frequent nouns belonging to four semantic categories:",
        "disease/symptom, drug, test, and treatment.",
        "However, the induced treatment lexicon was of relatively poor quality so we did not use it.",
        "The disease/symptom lexicon appeared to be of good quality, but it did not improve the performance of our speech act classifiers.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the fact that diseases were not distinguised from symptoms in our lexicon.",
        "Representative speech acts are typically associated with disease diagnoses and hypotheses, rather than individual symptoms.",
        "In the end, we only used the drug and test semantic lexicon in our classifiers.",
        "We used all 1000 terms in the drug lexicon, but only used the top 200 test words because the quality of the lexicon seemed questionable after that point.",
        "Semantic Tags: We also used bootstrapped contextual semantic taggers (Huang and Riloff, 2010) that had been previously trained for the domain of veterinary medicine.",
        "These taggers assign semantic class labels to noun phrase instances based on the surrounding context in a sentence.",
        "The taggers were trained on 4,629 veterinary message board posts using 10 seed words for each semantic category (see (Huang and Riloff, 2010) for details).",
        "To ensure good precision, only tags that have a confidence value > 1.0 were used.",
        "Our speech act classifiers used the tags associated with two semantic categories: drug and test.",
        "To create our classifiers, we used the Weka (Hall et al., 2009) machine learning toolkit.",
        "We used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a polynomial kernel and the default settings supplied by Weka.",
        "Because a sentence can include multiple speech acts, we created a set of binary classifiers, one for each of the four speech act classes.",
        "All four classifiers were applied to each sentence, so a sentence could be assigned multiple speech act classes."

        "To create training and evaluation data for our research, we asked two human annotators to manually label sentences in our message board posts.",
        "Identifying speech acts is not always obvious, even to people, so we gave them detailed annotation guidelines describing the four speech act classes discussed in Section 3.1.",
        "Then we gave them the same set of 50 message board posts from our collection to annotate independently.",
        "Each annotator was told to assign one or more speech act classes to each sentence (COM, DIR, EXP, REP), or to label the sentence as having no speech acts (NONE).",
        "The vast majority of sentences had either no speech acts or at most one speech act, but a small number of sentences contained multiple types of speech acts.",
        "We measured the inter-annotator agreement ofthe two human judges using the kappa (k) score (Car-letta, 1996).",
        "However, kappa agreement scores are only applicable to labelling schemes where each instance receives a single label.",
        "Therefore we computed kappa agreement in two different ways to look at the results from two different perspectives.",
        "In the first scheme, we discarded the small number of sentences that had multiple speech act labels and computed kappa on the rest.",
        "This produced a kappa score of .95, suggesting extremely high agreement.",
        "However, over 70% of the sentences in our data set have no speech act at all, so NONE was by far the most common label.",
        "Consequently, this agreement score does not necessarily reflect how consistently the judges agreed on the four speech act classes.",
        "In the second scheme, we computed kappa for each speech act category independently.",
        "For each category C, the judges were considered to be in agreement if both of them assigned category C to the sentence or if neither of the judges assigned category C to the sentence.",
        "Table 1 shows the k agreement scores using this approach.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement was very high for both the Expressive and Directive classes.",
        "Agreement was lower for the Commissive and Representative classes, but still relatively good so we felt comfortable that we had high-quality annotations.",
        "To create our final data set, the two judges adjudicated their disagreements on this set of 50 posts.",
        "We then asked each annotator to label an additional (different) set of 50 posts each.",

        "Table 2 shows the distribution of speech act labels in our data set.",
        "71% of the sentences did not include any speech acts.",
        "These were usually expository sentences containing factual information.",
        "29% of the sentences included one or more speech acts, so nearly 3 of the sentences were conversational in nature.",

        "Commissive and Representative speech acts are less common, each occurring in less than 3% of the sentences.",
        "For our first experiment, we created a speech act filtering classifier to distinguish sentences that contain one or more speech acts from sentences that do not contain any speech acts.",
        "Sentences labelled as having one or more speech acts were positive instances, and sentences labelled as NONE were negative instances.",
        "Speech act filtering could be useful for many applications, such as information extraction systems that only seek to extract facts.",
        "For example, information may be posed as a question (in a Directive) rather than a fact, information may be mentioned as part of a future plan (in a Commis-sive) that has not actually happened yet, or information may be stated as a hypothesis or suspicion (in a Representative) rather than as a fact.",

        "The lexical and syntactic features dramatically improve performance on Commissives, increasing F score from 27% to 40%, and they produce a 2% recall gain for Representatives but with a corresponding loss of precision.",
        "However, we observed that only a few of the lexical and syntactic features had much impact on performance.",
        "We experimented with different subsets of the features and obtained even better performance when using just 10 of them, which we will refer to as the minimal lexsyn features.",
        "The minimal lexsyn feature set consists of the 4 Tense+Person features, the Early Punctuation feature, the Sentence begins with",

        "We achieved good success at identifying both Directives and Expressives, although simple heuristics also perform well on these categories.",

        "Many different types of clues seem to be important for recognizing these sentences.",
        "The improvements obtained from adding semantic features also suggests that domain-specific semantics can be useful for recognizing some speech acts.",
        "However, there is still ample room for improvement, illustrating that speech act classification is a challenging problem.",
        "Representative speech acts were by far the most difficult to recognize.",
        "We believe that there are several reasons for their low performance.",
        "First, Representatives were sparse in the data set, occurring in only 2.91% of the sentences.",
        "Consequently, the classifier had relatively few positive training instances.",
        "Second, Representatives had the lowest inter-annotator agreement, indicating that human judges had difficulty recognizing these speech acts too.",
        "The judges often disagreed about whether a hypothesis or suspicion was the writer's own belief or whether it was stated as a fact reflecting general medical knowledge.",
        "The message board text genre is especially challenging in this regard because the writer is often presumed to be expressing his/her beliefs even when the writer does not explicitly say so.",
        "Finally, our semantic features could not distinguish between diseases and symptoms.",
        "Access to a resource that can reliably identify disease terms could potentially improve performance in this domain."

        "We found that Representative and Commissive speech acts are much more difficult to identify, although the performance of our Commissive classifier substantially improved with the addition of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.",
        "Except for the semantic class information, our feature set is domain-independent and could be used to recognize speech act sentences in message boards for any domain.",
        "Furthermore, our features only rely on part-of-speech tags and do not require parsing, which is of practical importance for text genres such as message boards that are littered with ungrammatical text, typos, and shorthand notations.",
        "In future work, we believe that segmenting sentences into clauses may help to train classifiers more precisely.",
        "Ultimately, we would like to identify the speech act expressions themselves because some sentences contain speech acts as well as factual information.",
        "Extracting the speech act expressions and clauses from message boards and similar text genres could provide better tracking of questions and answers in web forums and be used for summarization."
