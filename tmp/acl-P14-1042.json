        "Grammatical relations (GRs) represent functional relationships between language units in a sentence.",
        "They are exemplified in traditional grammars by the notions of subject, direct/indirect object, etc.",
        "GRs have assumed an important role in linguistic theorizing, within a variety of approaches ranging from generative grammar to functional theories.",
        "For example, several computational grammar formalisms, such as Lexical Function Grammar (LFG; Bresnan and Ka-plan, 1982; Dalrymple, 2001) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag, 1994) encode grammatical functions directly.",
        "In particular, GRs can be viewed as the dependency backbone of an LFG analysis that provide general linguistic insights, and have great potential advantages for NLP applications, (Kaplan et al., 2004; Briscoe and Carroll, 2006; Clark and Cur-ran, 2007a; Miyao et al., 2007).",
        "?",
        "Email correspondence.",
        "In this paper, we address the question of analyzing Chinese sentences with deep GRs.",
        "To acquire high-quality GR corpus, we propose a linguistically-motivated algorithm to translate a Government and Binding (GB; Chomsky, 1981; Carnie, 2007) grounded phrase structure treebank, i.e. Chinese Treebank (CTB; Xue et al., 2005) to a deep dependency bank where GRs are explicitly represented.",
        "Different from popular shallow dependency parsing that focus on tree-shaped structures, our GR annotations are represented as general directed graphs that express not only local but also various long-distance dependencies, such as coordinations, control/raising construc-tions, topicalization, relative clauses and many other complicated linguistic phenomena that goes beyond shallow syntax (see Fig. 1 for example.).",
        "Manual evaluation highlights the reliability of our linguistically-motivated GR extraction algorithm: The overall dependency-based precision and recall are 99.17 and 98.87.",
        "The automatically-converted corpus would be of use for a wide variety of NLP tasks.",
        "Recent years have seen the introduction of a number of treebank-guided statistical parsers capable of generating considerably accurate parses for Chinese.",
        "With the high-quality GR resource at hand, we study data-driven GR parsing.",

        "Moreover, we introduce an effective approximation of that oracle, which decreases decoding ambiguity but practically covers almost exactly the same graphs for our data.",
        "Based on the stronger transition system, we build a GR parser with a discriminative model for disambiguation and a beam decoder for inference.",
        "We conduct experiments on CTB 6.0 to profile this parser.",

        "Basically, the annotations are automatically converted from a GB-grounded phrase-structure treebank, namely CTB.",
        "Conceptually, this conversion is similar to the conversions from CTB structures to representations in deep grammar formalisms (Tse and Curran, 2010; Yu et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2007; Xia, 2001).",
        "However, our work is grounded in GB, which is the linguistic basis of the construction of CTB.",
        "We argue that this theoretical choice makes the conversion process more compatible with the original annotations and therefore more accurate.",
        "We use directed graphs to explicitly encode bi-lexical dependencies involved in coordination, raising/control constructions, ex-traction, topicalization, and many other complicated phenomena.",
        "Fig. 1 shows an example of such a GR graph and its original CTB annotation.",
        "2.1 Linguistic Basis GRs are encoded in different ways in different languages.",
        "In some languages, e.g. Turkish, grammatical function is encoded by means of morphological marking, while in highly configurational languages, e.g. Chinese, the grammatical function of a phrase is heavily determined by its constituent structure position.",
        "Dominant Chomskyan theo-ries, including GB, have defined GRs as configurations at phrase structures.",
        "Following this princi-ple, CTB groups words into constituents through the use of a limited set of fundamental grammatical functions.",

        "The construction of the widely used PARC DepBank (King et al., 2003) is a good example.",
        "LFG relates c-structure and f-structure through f-structure annotations, which compositionally map every constituent to a corresponding f-structure.",
        "Borrowing this key idea, we translate CTB trees to dependency graphs by first augmenting each constituency with f-structure annotations, then propagating the head words of the head or conjunct daughter(s) upwards to their parents, and finally creating a dependency graph.",

        "Natural languages do not always interpret linguistic material locally.",

        "In addition, since the big PRO is also anaphoric, it is possible to find coindexed components sometimes.",
        "Such non-local information is also very valuable.",
        "Beyond CTB annotations, we introduce a number of phrase-structure patterns to extract more non-local dependencies.",
        "The method heavily leverages linguistic rules to exploit structural information.",
        "We take into account both theoretical assumptions and analyzing practices to enrich coindexation information according to phrase-structure patterns.",
        "In particular, we try to link an anaphoric EC e with its c-commonders if no non-empty antecedent has already been coindexed with e. Because the CTB is influenced deeply by the X-bar syntax, which regulates constituent analysis much, the number of our linguistic rules is quite modest.",
        "For the development of conversion rules, we used the first 9 files of CTB, which contains about 100 sentences.",

        "There are two sources of errors in treebank conversion: (1) inadequate conversion rules and (2) wrong or inconsistent original annotations.",
        "During the creation of the gold standard corpus, we find that the former is mainly caused by complicated unbounded dependencies and the lack of internal structure for some kinds of phrases.",
        "Such problems are very hard to solve through rules only, if not possible, since original annotations do not provide sufficient information.",
        "The latter problem is more scattered and unpredictable.",
        "2.4 Statistics Allowing non-projective dependencies generally makes parsing either by graph-based or transition-based dependency parsing harder.",
        "Substantial research effort has been devoted in recent years to the design of elegant solutions for this problem.",
        "There are much more crossing arcs in the GR 449 graphs than syntactic dependency trees.",
        "In the training data (defined in Section 4.1), there are 558132 arcs and 86534 crossing pairs, About half of the sentences have crossing arcs (10930 out of 22277).",
        "The wide existence of crossing arcs poses an essential challenge for GR parsing, namely, to find methods for handling crossing arcs without a significant loss in accuracy and efficiency.",

        "In this section, we investigate the feasibility of applying a data-driven, grammar-free approach to build GRs directly.",
        "In particular, transition-based dependency parsing method is studied.",
        "3.1 Data-Driven Dependency Parsing Data-driven, grammar-free dependency parsing has received an increasing amount of attention in the past decade.",
        "Such approaches, e.g. transition-based (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2008) and graph-based (McDonald, 2006; Torres Martins et al., 2009) models have attracted the most attention of dependency parsing in recent years.",
        "Transition-based parsers utilize transition systems to derive dependency trees together with treebank-induced statistical models for predicting transitions.",
        "This approach was pioneered by (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) and (Nivre et al., 2004).",
        "Most research concentrated on surface syntactic structures, and the majority of existing approaches are limited to producing only trees.",
        "We notice two exceptions.",
