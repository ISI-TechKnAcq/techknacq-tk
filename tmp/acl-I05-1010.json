        "Knowledge about how we recognize objects is of great practical importance for many NLP tasks.",
        "Knowledge about attributes, which tells us from what viewpoints objects are usually understood or described, is one of such type of knowledge.",
        "For example, the attributes of car objects will be weight, engine, steering wheel, driving feel,and manufacturer.",
        "In other words, attributes are items whose values we want to know when we want to know about the object.",
        "More analytically, we tend to regard A as an attribute for objects of class C when A works as if function v = A(o),o G C where v is necessary to us to identify o (especially to distinguish o from o'(= o) G C).",
        "Therefore, obvious applications of attributes are ones such as summarization [1,2] and question-answering [3].",
        "Moreover, they can be useful as features in word clustering [4] or machine learning.",
        "Although the knowledge base for attributes can be prepared manually (e.g., WordNet [5]), problems are cost and coverage.",
        "To overcome these, we propose a method that automatically acquires attribute knowledge from the Web.",
        "To acquire the attributes for a given class, C (e.g., car), the proposed method first downloads documents that contain class label C (e.g., \"car\") from the Web.1We extract the candidates of attribute words from these documents and score them according to the statistics of words, lexico-syntactic patterns, and HTML tags.",
        "Highly scored words are output as attributes for the class.",
        "Lexico-syntactic patterns and other statistics have been used in other lexical knowledge acquisition systems [3,4,6,7,8].",
        "We specifically used lexico-syntactic patterns involving the Japanese postposition \"no\" as used in [8] such as \"C no A\"where A is an attribute word, which is almost equivalent to pattern \"A of C\"usedin[7]to",
        "Automatic Discovery of Attribute Words from Web Documents 107",
        "find part-whole relations.",
        "Novel features of our method are its use of Web search engines to focus on documents highly relevant to the class and its use of statistics concerning attribute words and surrounding HTML tags.",
        "One of the difficulties in studying attribute knowledge is that there are no standard definitions of attributes, or criteria for evaluating obtained attributes.",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple but effective definition of attributes that matches our motivation and applications, i.e., whether we can ask a question about the attribute and whether there is an answer to that question (question answerability).",
        "For example, one can ask as \"Who is the manufacturer of this car?",
        "\", and someone might answer \"Honda\", because we want to know the manufacturer when we concerned about cars.",
        "We designed a procedure for evaluating attributes based on this idea.",
        "As the literature points out [9,10], attributes can include many types of relations such as property (e.g., weight), part-of (e.g., engine), telic (e.g., driving feel), and agentive (e.g., manufacturer).",
        "However, we ignored type distinctions in this study.",
        "First, because attributes are useful even if the type is not known, and second, because defining attributes as one of these types and evaluating them only complicates the evaluation process, making the results unstable.",
        "The use of linguistic tests to define attributes is not that new.",
        "Woods [11] devised a test on whether we can say \"The A of o is v.\" Although we followed this procedure, we focused more on attributes that are important for our understanding of an object by using question-answerability as our criterion."

        "All the nouns appearing in the local document set are regarded as candidates of attribute words.",

        "The reason this score was used in addition to n(C, A) was to obtain more reliable scores by increasing the number of documents to be matched.",

        "We designed the QA test shown in Fig. 2 to assess the correctness of attribute A for class C based on this criterion.",
        "Several points should be noted.",
        "First, since the value for the attribute is actually defined for the object instance (i.e., v = A(o),o G C), we should qualify class label C using \"kono (this)\" to refer to an object instance of class C.",

        "For example, stapler is not an attribute of company in our sense, although almost all companies own staplers.",
        "Our naturalness criterion can reflect this observation since the question \"What is the stapler of this company?\"",
        "is unnatural as a first question when talking about a company, and therefore we can successfully conclude that stapler is not an attribute.",
        "Note that Woods' linguistic test [11] (i.e., whether \"the attribute of an object is a value\" can be stated or not) cannot reject stapler since it does not have the naturalness requirement (e.g., we can say \"the stapler of [used by] SONY is Stapler-X\").5 In addition, note that such importances can be assessed more easily in the QA test, since questioners basically ask what they think is important at least at the time of utterance.",

        "Although the most appropriate question for seito representing seito suu is (6) in Fig. 2, it is unfortunately ungrammatical since ikutu cannot be used for the number of persons.",
        "Therefore, seito representing seito suu will fail the QA test.6",
        "In Japanese, most of the elided parts can be restored by adding appropriate suffixes (as \"suu\" (number of) in the previous example) or by adding \"no\" + nominalized adjectives.",
        "Thus, when the attribute word failed the first QA test, we asked the evaluators to redo the QA test by choosing an appropriate suffix or a nominalized adjective from the list of allowed augmentations and adding it to the end of the evaluated word.",
        "Figure 3 lists the allowed augmentations.7'8",
        "Although our primal aim was to acquire the attributes for a given class, i.e., , to find attributes that are common to all the instances of the class, we found, in preliminary experiments, that some uncommon (but interesting) attributes were assessed as correct according to the QA test depending on the evaluator.",
        "An example is subtitle for the class movie.",

        "For example, only foreign films have subtitles in Japan.",
        "However, we think this attribute is also useful in practice for people who have a keen interest in foreign films.",
        "Thus, the evaluators were asked whether the attribute was common for most instances of the class when the attribute was judged to be correct in the QA test.",
        "We call attributes that passed this generality test general attributes, and those that failed but passed the QA test relaxed attributes (note that general attributes is a subset of relaxed attributes).",
        "We compare the accuracies for the relaxed and general attributes in the experiments.",
        "Finally, we should note that we designed the evaluation procedure so that the evaluators could be asked whether candidate A is a hyponym of C before the QA tests.",
        "If A is a hyponym of C, we can skip all subsequent tests since A cannot be an attribute of C. We added this test because the output of the system often contains hyponyms and these tend to cause confusion in the QA tests since expression \"C no A\" is natural even when A is a hyponym of C (e.g., \"anime no Dragon Ball (Dragon Ball [of/the] anime)\")."
