        "The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake in March 11, 2011 killed 15,883 people and destroyed over 260,000 households (National Police Agency of Japan, 2013).",
        "Accustomed way of living suddenly became unmanageable and people found themselves in extreme conditions for months.",
        "Just after the disaster, many people used Twitter for posting problem reports and aid messages as it functioned while most communication channels suffered disruptions (Winn, 2011; Acar and Mu-raki, 2011; Sano et al., 2012).",
        "Examples of such problem reports and aid messages, translated from Japanese tweets, are given below (P1, A1).",
        "P1 My friend said infant formula is sold out.",
        "If somebody knows shops in Sendai-city where they still have it in stock, please let us know.",
        "A1 At Jusco supermarket in Sendai, you can still buy water and infant formula.",
        "If A1 would have been forwarded to the sender of P1, it could have helped since it would help the ?friend?",
        "to obtain infant formula.",
        "But in reality, the majority of such reports/messages, especially unforeseen ones went unnoticed amongst the mass of information (Ohtake et al., 2013).",
        "In addition, there were cases where many humanitarian organizations responded to the same problems and wasted precious resources.",
        "For instance, many volunteers responded to problems which were heavily reported by public media, leading to oversupply (Saijo, 2012).",
        "Such waste of resources could have been avoided if the organizations would have successfully shared the aid messages for the same problems.",
        "Such observations motivated this work.",
        "We developed methods for recognizing problem reports and aid messages in tweets and finding proper matches between them.",
        "By browsing the discovered matches, victims can be assisted to overcome their problems, and humanitarian organizations can avoid redundant relief efforts.",
        "We define problem reports, aid messages and their successful matches as follows.",
        "Problem report: A tweet that informs about the possibility or emergence of a problem that requires a treatment or countermeasure.",
        "Aid message: A tweet that (1) informs about situations or actions that can be a remedy or solution for a problem, or (2) informs that the problem is solved or is about to be solved.",
        "Problem-aid tweet match: A tweet pair is a problem-aid tweet match (1) if the aid message informs how to overcome the problem, (2) if the aid message informs about the set",
        "tlement of the problem, or (3) if the aid message provides information which contributes to the settlement of the problem.",
        "In this work we excluded direct requests, such as ?Send us food!",
        "?, from problem reports.",
        "This is because it is relatively easy to recognize such direct requests by checking mood types (i.e., imperative) and their behavior is quite different from problem reports like ?People in Sendai are starving?.",
        "Problem reports in this work do not directly state which actions are required, only implying the necessity of a countermeasure through claiming the existence of problems.",
        "An underlying assumption of our method is that we can find a noun-predicate dependency relation that works as an indicator of problems and aids in problem reports and aid messages, which we refer to as problem nucleus and aid nucleus.1 An example of problem nucleus is ?infant formula is sold out?",
        "in P1, and that of aid nucleus is ?",
        "(can) buy infant formula?",
        "in A1.",
        "Many problem-aid tweet matches can be recognized through problem and aid nuclei pairs.",
        "We also assume that if the problem and aid nuclei match, they share the same noun.",
        "Then, the semantics of predicates in the nuclei is the main factor that decides whether the nuclei constitute a match.",
        "We introduce a semantic classification of predicates according to the framework of excitation polarities proposed in Hashimoto et al. (2012).",
        "Our hypothesis is that excitation polarities along with trouble expressions can characterize problem reports, aid messages and their matches.",
        "We developed a supervised method encoding such information into its features.",
        "An evident alternative to this approach is to use sentiment analysis (Mandel et al., 2012; Tsagkali-dou et al., 2011) assuming that problem reports should include something ?bad?",
        "while aid messages describe something ?good?.",
        "However, we will show that this does not work well in our experiments.",
        "We think this is due to mismatch between the concepts of problem/aid and sentiment polarity.",
        "Note that previous work on ?demand?",
        "recognition also found similar tendencies (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2008).",
        "Another issue in this task is, of course, the context surrounding problem/aid nuclei.",
        "The fol",
        "buy infant formula.",
        "The problem nuclei of FP1 and P1 are the same but FP1 is not a problem report because of the expression ?I do not believe?.",
        "The aid nuclei of FA1 and A1 are the same but FA1 does not constitute a proper match with P1 because FA1 and P1 refer to different cities, ?Iwaki?",
        "and ?Sendai?.",
        "In this work, the problems concerning the modality and other semantic modifications to problem/aid nuclei by context are dealt with by the introduction of features representing the text surrounding the nuclei in machine learning.",

        "We developed machine learning based systems to recognize problem reports, aid messages and problem-aid tweet matches.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the whole system.",
        "First, location names in tweets are identified by matching tweets against our location dictionary, described in Section 3.",
        "Then, each tweet is paired with each dependency relation in the tweet, which is a candidate of problem/aid nuclei and given to the problem report and aid message recognizers.",
        "A tweet-nucleus-candidate pair judged as problem report is combined with another tweet-nucleus-candidate pair recognized as an aid message if the two nuclei share the same noun and the tweets share the same location name, and given to the problem-aid match recognizer.",
        "In the following, problem and aid nuclei are denoted by a noun-template pair.",
        "A template is composed of a predicate and its argument position.",
        "For instance, ?water supply stopped?",
        "in P2 is a problem nucleus, ?water supply recovered?",
        "in A2 is an aid nucleus and they are denoted by the noun-template pairs ?water supply, X stopped?",
        "and ?water supply, X recovered?.",
        "Roughly speaking, we regard the tasks of problem report recognition and aid message recognition as the tasks of finding proper problem/aid nuclei in tweets and our method performs these tasks based on the semantic properties of nouns and templates in problem/aid nucleus candidates and their surrounding contexts.",
        "The basic intuition behind this approach can be explained using excitation polarity proposed in Hashimoto et al. (2012).",
        "Excitation polarity differentiates templates into ?excitatory?",
        "or ?inhibitory?",
        "with regard to the main function or effect of entities referred to by their argument noun.",
        "While excitatory templates (e.g., cause X, buy X, suffer from X) entail that the main function or effect is activated or enhanced, inhibitory templates (e.g., ruin X, prevent X, X runs out) entail that the main function or effect is deactivated or suppressed.",
        "The templates that do not fit into the above categorization are classified as ?neutral?.",
        "We observed that problem reports in general included either of (A) a dependency relation between a noun referring to some trouble and an excitatory template or (B) a dependency relation between a noun not referring to any trouble and an inhibitory template.",
        "Examples of (A) include ?carbon monoxide poisoning, suffer from X?, ?false rumor, spread X?.",
        "They refer to events that activate troubles.",
        "On the other hand, (B) is exemplified by ?school, X is collapsed?, ?battery, X runs out?, which imply that some non-trouble objects such as resources, appliances and facilities are dysfunctional.",
        "We assume that if we can find such dependency relations in tweets, the tweets are likely to be problem reports.",
        "Contrary, a tweet is more likely to be an aid message when it includes either (C) a dependency relation between a noun referring to some trouble and an inhibitory template or (D) a dependency relation between a noun not referring to any troutrouble non-trouble excitatory (A) problem nucleus (D) aid nucleus inhibitory (C) aid nucleus (B) problem nucleus",
        "ble and an excitatory template.",
        "Examples of (C) are ?flu, X was eradicated (in some shelter)?",
        "and ?debris, remove X?.",
        "They represent the dysfunction of troubles and can mean the solution or the settlement of troubles.",
        "On the other hand, examples of (D) include ?school, X re-build?",
        "and ?baby formula, buy X?.",
        "They entail that some resources function properly or become available.",
        "These formulations are summarized in Table 1.",
        "As an interesting consequence of such a view on problem/aid nucleus, we can say the following regarding problem-aid tweet matchings: when a problem nucleus and an aid nucleus are an adequate match, the excitation polarities of their templates are opposite.",
        "Consider the following tweets.",
        "P3 Some people were going back to Iwaki, but the water system has not come back yet.",
        "It's terrible that bath is unusable.",
        "A3 We open the bath for the public, located on the 2F of Iwaki Kuhon temple.",
        "If you?re staying at a relief shelter and would like to take a bath, you can use it.",
        "?Bath is unusable?",
        "in P3 is a problem nucleus while ?open the bath?",
        "in A3 is an aid nucleus.",
        "Since the problem reported in P3 can be solved with A3, they are a successful match.",
        "The inhibitory template ?X is unusable?",
        "indicates that the function of ?bath?, a non-trouble expression, is suppressed.",
        "The excitatory template ?open X?",
        "indicates that the function of ?bath?",
        "is activated.",
        "The same holds when we consider the noun referring to troubles like ?flu?.",
        "The polarity of the template in a problem nucleus should be excitatory like ?flu is raging?",
        "while that of an aid nucleus should be inhibitory like ?flu, X was eradicated?.",
        "These examples keep the constraint that the problem and aid nucleus should have opposite polarities when they constitute a match.",
        "Note that the formulations of problem report, aid message and their matches or the excitation matrix (Table 1) were not presented to our annotators and our test/training data may contain data that contradict with the formulations.",
        "These formulations constitute the hypothesis to be validated in this work.",
        "An important point to be stressed here is that there are problem-aid tweet matches that do not fit into our formulations.",
        "For instance, we assume that the problem nucleus and aid nucleus in a proper match share the same noun.",
        "However, tweet pairs such as ?There are many injured people in Sendai city?",
        "and ?We are sending ambulances to Sendai?",
        "can constitute a proper match, but there is no proper problem-aid nuclei pair that share the same noun in these tweets.",
        "(We can find the dependency relations sharing ?Sendai?",
        "but they do not express anything about the contents of problem and aid.)",
        "The point is that the tweet pairs can be judged because people know ambulances can be a countermeasure to injured people as world knowledge.",
        "Introducing such world knowledge is beyond the scope of this current study.",
        "Also, we exclude direct requests from problem reports.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, identifying direct requests is relatively easy, hence we excluded them from our target."
