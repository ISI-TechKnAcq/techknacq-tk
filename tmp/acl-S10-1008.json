        "Semantic role labeling (SRL) has been defined as a sentence-level natural-language processing task in which semantic roles are assigned to the syntactic arguments of a predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Semantic roles describe the function of the participants in an event.",
        "Identifying the semantic roles of the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what to whom when where how, etc.",
        "However, semantic role labeling as it is currently defined misses a lot of information due to the fact that it is viewed as a sentence-internal task.",
        "Hence, relations between different local semantic argument structures are disregarded.",
        "This view of SRL as a sentence-internal task is partly due to the fact that large-scale manual annotation projects such as FrameNet and PropBank typically present their annotations lexicographically by lemma rather than by source text.",
        "It is clear that there is an interplay between local argument structure and the surrounding discourse (Fillmore, 1977).",
        "In early work, Palmer et al.",
        "(1986) discussed filling null complements from context by using knowledge about individual predicates and tendencies of referential chaining across sentences.",
        "But so far there have been few attempts to find links between argument structures across clause and sentence boundaries explicitly on the basis of semantic relations between the predicates involved.",
        "Lwo notable exceptions are Fillmore and Baker (2001) and Burchardt et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Fillmore and Baker (2001) analyse a short newspaper article and discuss how frame semantics could benefit discourse processing but without making concrete suggestions of how to model this.",
        "Burchardt et al.",
        "(2005) provide a detailed analysis of the links between the local semantic argument structures in a short text; however their system is not fully implemented either.",
        "With the shared task, we aimed to make a first step towards taking SRL beyond the domain of individual sentences by linking local semantic argument structures to the wider discourse context.",
        "The task addresses the problem of finding fillers for roles which are neither instantiated as direct dependents of our target predicates nor displaced through long-distance dependency or coinstantiation constructions.",
        "Often a referent for an uninstantiated role can be found in the wider context, i.e. in preceding or following sentences.",

        "Briefly, omissions of core arguments of predicates are categorized along two dimensions, the licensor and the interpretation they receive.",
        "The idea of a licensor refers to the fact that either a particular lexical item or a particular grammatical construction must be present for the omission of a frame element (FE) to occur.",
        "For instance, the omission of the agent in (3) is licensed by the passive construction.",
        "ßProtagonist",
        "The omission is a constructional omission because it can apply to any predicate with an appropriate semantics that allows it to combine with the passive construction.",

        "(4) We arrived 0Goal at 8pm.",
        "The above two examples also illustrate the second major dimension of variation.",
        "Whereas, in (3) the protagonist making the mistake is only existentially bound within the discourse (instance of indefinite null instantiation, INI), the Goal location in (4) is an entity that must be accessible to speaker and hearer from the discourse or its context (definite null instantiation, DNI).",
        "Finally, note that the licensing construction or lexical item fully and reliably determines the interpretation.",
        "Whereas missing by-phrases have always an indefinite interpretation, whenever arrive omits the Goal lexically, the Goal has to be interpreted as definite, as it is in (4).",
        "The import of this classification to the task here is that we will concentrate on cases of DNI, be they licensed lexically or constructionally."

        "We originally intended to offer the participants a choice of two different tasks: a full task, in which the test set was only annotated with gold standard word senses (i.e., frames) for the target words and the participants had to perform role recognition/labeling and null instantiation linking, and a NI only task, in which the test set was already annotated with gold standard semantic argument structures and the participants only had to recognize definite null instantiations and find links to antecedents in the wider context (NI linking).",
        "However, it turned out that the basic semantic role labeling task was already quite challenging for our data set.",
        "Previous shared tasks have shown that frame-semantic SRL of running text is a hard problem (Baker et al., 2007), partly due to the fact that running text is bound to contain many frames for which no or little annotated training data are available.",
        "In our case the difficulty was increased because our data came from a new genre and domain (i.e., crime fiction, see Section 3.2).",
        "Hence, we decided to add standard SRL, i.e., role recognition and labeling, as a third task (SRL only).",
        "This task did not involve NI linking.",
        "The participants were allowed to make use of a variety of data sources.",
        "We provided a training set annotated with semantic argument structure and null instantiation information.",
        "The annotations were originally made using FrameNet-style and later mapped semi-automatically to PropBank annotations, so that participants could choose which framework they wanted to work in.",
        "The data formats we used were TIGER/SALSA XML (Erk and Padö, 2004) (FrameNet-style) and a modified CoNLL-format (PropBank-style).",
        "As it turned out, all participants chose to work on FrameNet-style annotations, so we will not describe the Prop-Bank annotation in this paper (see Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2009) for more details).",
        "FrameNet-style annotation of full text is extremely time-consuming.",
        "Since we also had to annotate null instantiations and co-reference chains (for evaluation purposes, see Section 4), we could only make available a limited amount of data.",
        "Hence, we allowed participants to make use of additional data, in particular the FrameNet and Prop-Bank releases.",
        "We envisaged that the participants would want to use these additional data sets to train SRL systems for the full task and to learn something about typical fillers for different roles in order to solve the NI linking task.",
        "The annotated data sets we made available were meant to provide additional information, e.g., about the typical distance between an NI and its filler and about how to distinguish DNIs and INIs.",
        "We annotated texts from two of Arthur Conan Doyle's fiction works.",

        "The test set was made up of the last two chapters of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\".",
        "We chose fiction rather than news because we believe that fiction texts with a linear narrative generally contain more context-resolvable NIs.",
        "They also tend to be longer and have a simpler structure than news texts, which typically revisit the same facts repeatedly at different levels of detail (in the so-called 'inverted pyramid' structure) and which mix event reports with commentary and evaluation, thus sequencing material that is understood as running in parallel.",
        "Fiction texts should lend themselves more readily to a first attempt at integrating discourse structure into semantic role labeling.",
        "We chose Conan Doyle's work because most of his books are not subject to copyright anymore, which allows us to freely release the annotated data.",
        "Note, however, that this choice of data means that our texts come from a different domain and genre than many of the examples in FrameNet and PropBank as well as making use of a somewhat older variety of English.",
        "Table 1 provides basic statistics of the data sets.",
        "The training data had 3.1 frames per sentence and the test data 3.2, which is lower than the 8.8 frames per sentence in the test data of the 2007 SemEval task on Frame Semantic Structure Extraction.",
        "We think this is mainly the result of switching to a domain different from the bulk of what FrameNet has made available in the way of full-text annotation.",
        "In doing so, we encountered many new frames and lexical units for which we could not ourselves create the necessary frames and provide lexicographic annotations.",
        "The statistics also show that null-instantiation is relatively common: in the training data, about 18.7% of all FEs are omitted, and in the test set, about 18.4%.",
        "Of the DNIs, 80.9% had an antecedent in the training data, and 74.2% in the test data.",
        "To ensure a high quality of the annotations, both data sets were annotated by more than one person and then adjudicated.",
        "The training set was annotated independently by two experienced annotators and then adjudicated by the same two people.",
        "The test set was annotated by three annotators and then adjudicated by the two experienced annotators.",
        "Throughout the annotation and adjudication process, we discussed difficult cases and also maintained a wiki.",
        "Additionally, we created a software tool that checked the consistency of our annotations against the frame, frame element and FE-relation specifications of FrameNet and alerted annotators to problems with their annotations.",
        "The average agreement (F-score) for frame assignment for pairs of annotators on the two chapters in the test set ranges from 0.7385 to 0.7870.",
        "The agreement of individual annotators with the adjudicated gold standard ranges from 0.666 to 0.798.",
