        "• POS-tagging and lemmatization; a tagger that is based on Brill's TBL architecture (Brill, 1997), modified to address peculiarities of the Greek language (Papageorgiou et al., 2000) was used in order to assign mor-phosyntactic information to tokenized words.",

        "• Surface syntactic analysis; the Greek chun-ker is based on a grammar of 186 rules (Boutsis et al., 2000) developed for the automatic recognition of non-recursive phrasal categories: adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases, nouns, verbs (chunks) (Papageorgiou et al., 2002).",
        "• Term extraction; a Greek Term Extractor was used for spotting terms and idiomatic words (Georgantopoulos, Piperidis, 2000).",
        "Term Extractor's method proceeds in three pipelined stages: (a) morphosyntactic annotation of the domain corpus, (b) corpus parsing based on a pattern grammar endowed with regular expressions and feature-structure unification, and (c) lemmatization.",
        "Candidate terms are then statistically evaluated with an aim to skim valid domain terms and lessen the overgeneration effect caused by pattern grammars (hybrid methodology).",

        "Moreover, terms pertaining to the folklore domain as well as names of Persons and Locations identified in the EL - BG parallel texts were semi-automatically aligned.",
        "The outcome of the process of text alignment at below the sentence level was then validated manually.",
        "As it has already been stated, the tools that were deployed for the linguistic processing are generic ones that were initially developed for different text types/genres.",

        "In fact, some of the literary works were written in the 19th century or the beginning of 20th century, and their language reflects the writing standards of the corresponding period.",
        "Therefore, as it was expected, the overall performance of the aforementioned tools was lower than the one reported for the texts these tools were initially trained for.",
        "To this end, performance at POS-tagging level dropped from 97% to 77% for the Greek data since no normalization of the primary data was performed.",
        "On the other hand, the BG morphological analyzer coverage, whose benchmark performance is 96% dropped to 92 % on poems and folktales and to 94% on literary texts and legends.",
        "The reason was that the language of processed literary texts and legends came normalized from the sources, while the poems and folktales kept some percentage of archaic or dialect words.",

        "Moreover, the accuracy of the neural network disambiguator and the rule-based one was 97 %.",
