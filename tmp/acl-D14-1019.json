        "Recently, syntactic information has helped significantly to improve statistical machine translation.",

        "The proposed method achieves clustering by directly maximizing the likelihood of synchronous rules, whereas previous work considered only the similarity of probabilistic distributions of labels.",
        "We tested the proposed method on Japanese-English and Chinese-English translation tasks and found order-of-magnitude higher clustering speeds for reducing labels and gains in translation quality compared with previous clustering method."

        "In recent years, statistical machine translation (SMT) models that use syntactic information have received significant research attention.",
        "These models use syntactic information on the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Mylonakis and Sima?an, 2011), the target side (Galley et al., 2006; Huang and Knight, 2006) or both sides (Chiang, 2010; Hanneman and Lavie, 2013) produce syntactically correct translations.",
        "Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) proposed syntax-augmented MT (SAMT), which is a MT system that uses syntax labels of a parser.",
        "The SAMT grammar directly encodes syntactic information into the synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) of Hiero (Chiang, 2007), which relies on two nonterminal labels.",
        "One problem in adding syntax labels to Hiero-style rules is that only partial phrases are assigned labels.",
        "It is common practice to extend labels by using the idea of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) on the problem.",
        "Although this extended syntactical information may improve the coverage of rules and syntactic correctness in translation, the increased grammar size causes serious speed and data-sparseness problems.",
        "To address these problems, Hanneman and Lavie (2013) coarsen syntactic labels using the similarity of the probabilistic distributions of labels in synchronous rules and showed that performance improved.",
        "In the present work, we follow the idea of label-set coarsening and propose a new method to group syntax labels.",
        "First, as an optimization criterion, we use the logarithm of the likelihood of synchronous rules instead of the similarity of probabilistic distributions of syntax labels.",
        "Second, we use exchange clustering (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008), which is faster than the agglomerative-clustering algorithm used in the previous work.",

        "Although the use of extended syntax labels may increase the coverage of rules and improve the potential for syntactically correct translations, the growth of the nonterminal symbols significantly affects the speed of decoding and causes a serious data-sparseness problem.",

        "However, their method relies on an agglomerative clustering with a worst-case time complexity of O(|N | 2 log |N |).",
        "Also, clustering based on label distributions does not always imply higher-quality rules, because it does not consider the interactions of the nonterminals on the left-hand side and the right-hand side in each synchronous rule.",
        "3 Syntax-Label Clustering As an alternative to using the similarity of probabilistic distributions as a criterion for syntax-label clustering, we propose a clustering method based on the maximum likelihood of the synchronous rules in a training data D. We uses the idea of maximizing the Bayesian posterior probability P (M |D) of the overall model structure M given data D (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).",
