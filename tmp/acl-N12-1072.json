        "In the few topics where performance is worse (Death Penalty, Gun Control, Mac vs. PC, Superman vs. Batman), the MaxCut graph gets oriented to the stance sides the wrong way, so that the cut actually groups the posts correctly into sides, but then assigns them to the wrong side.",
        "For Maxcut, as expected, there are significant correlations between the % of Rebuttals in a debate and Precision (R = .16 ) and Recall (R= .22), as well as between Posts/Author and Precision (R = .25) and Recall (R = .43).",

        "In future work, we plan to explore whether deeper linguistic features can yield large improvements in both the base classifier and in MaxCut results, and to explore better ways of automatically orienting the MaxCut graph to stance side.",
