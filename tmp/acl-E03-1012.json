        "Current paper presents the results of a two-year project during which a consortium of the University of Szeged and the MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest developed a morpho-syntactically parsed and annotated (disambiguated) corpus for Hungarian.",
        "For morpho-syntactic encoding, the Hungarian version of MSD (Morpho-Syntactic Description) has been used.",
        "The corpus contains texts of five different topic areas: schoolchildren's compositions, fiction, computer-related texts, news, and legal texts.",
        "During annotation, linguists have checked the morpho-syntactic parsing of each word.",
        "Finding part-of-speech tagging (disambiguation) rules by machine learning algorithms was also studied by the researchers of the consortium.",
        "Due to the fact that the size of the corpus reaches up to 1 million text words without punctuation characters, it may serve as a reference source for numerous future research applications.",
        "The corpus can be obtained freely via Internet for research and educational purposes."

        "The beginning of the work dates back to 1998 when the authors started a research project on the application of ILP (Inductive Logic Programming) learning methods for part-of-speech tagging.",
        "This research was done within the framework of a European ESPRIT project (LTR 20237, \"ILP2\"), where first studies were based on the so-called TELRI corpus (Erjavec et al., 1998).",
        "Since the corpus annotation had several deficiencies and its size proved to be small for further research, a national project has been organized with the main goal to create a suitably large training corpus for machine learning applications, primarily for POS (Part-of-speech) taggingPOS tagging plays a central role in NLP (natural language processing).",
        "Hungarian words similarly to other languages - may have more than one part-of-speech labels (e.g. the word eg may be a noun or a verb).",
        "In many natural language processing software systems, including web-based dictionaries and optical character recognition programs, determining the part-ofspeech tag of a particular word in a given context is significant.",
        "Syntactic and semantic parsing of natural language sentences are greatly influenced by adequate part-of-speech tagging.",
        "In their preliminary studies, the consortium members found that ambiguous words are very frequent in Hungarian language.",
        "Hence, developing an annotation (disambiguation) technology proved to be a real necessity.",
        "When choosing the form of representation of the corpus it was taken into consideration that it should comply with international standards.",
        "Therefore, the tag encoding system of the annotated Hungarian corpus was based on a technology (MSD) that has already been applied to other - mainly European - languages."

        "Collecting special text corpora in Hungary has already begun in the eighties.",
        "These texts have been thematically grouped, but were not analyzed morpho-syntactically.",
        "The development of the morphological parser Humor (High-speed Unification Morphology) began in the early nineties (Proszeky and Kis, 1999).",
        "In the framework of the Copernicus project 106 \"MULTEXT-EAST\" between 1995 and 1997, the participants created an augmented morpho-syntactic coding scheme, called MSD (Erjavec et al., 1997) to be applicable to Central and East European languages.",
        "To demonstrate the behavior of this coding technique, a parallel annotated corpus was developed based on Orwell's novel, \"1984\".",
        "Part-of-speech tagging of this corpus was completed manually by linguists.",
        "It is widely known as TELRI corpus and published on a CD-ROM (Erjavec et al., 1998).",
        "For automatic generation of morpho-syntactic labels for the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus the above-mentioned Humor system was used.",
        "Unfortunately, the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus did not implement the whole encoding scheme; more precisely, it did not classify the pronouns, numerals, adverbs, and conjunctions.",
        "For example, all pronouns got the same [P] tag, without any attributes encoded.",
        "Other attempts for making a Hungarian annotated corpus was not known before the presently described project was started in 2000.",
        "A comparison of the manually annotated Hungarian corpus and the Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus can be seen in Table 1. the TELRI corpus Using the TELRI corpus Horvath, Alexin, Gyimothy, and Wrobel, (1999) investigated the applicability of several machine learning algorithms for learning part-of-speech tagging rules for Hungarian.",
        "The manually annotated Hungarian corpus can significantly enlarge the learning database for applying similar methods.",
        "In section 3 the main feature of the corpus is presented, in section 4 more statistical data and two connecting projects is presented.",

        "Participants of the project aimed not only to increase the amount of corpus text up to 1 million text words, but to improve the quality of the annotation as well.",
        "By quality we mean both full conformity to the MSD coding scheme and accurate manual morpho-syntactic parsing and tagging.",
        "The parts of the 1-million-word corpus were selected and put together by the project partners.",
        "Naturally, a corpus of this size could not cover the whole written language, but the consortium tried to mainly include most recent texts, well representing the major types available through the Internet, including the special language used by the youth - the primary users of the Internet.",
        "Based on this idea, the consortium decided to gather texts belonging to five different topic areas listed below.",
        "Parts of the corpus belonging to each topic area contains roughly 200 000 words respectively.",

        "This material was collected from pupils of the age 16 (grade 10).",

        "The next step of processing was morpho-syntactic parsing.",
        "Preliminary steps were executed by a segmenting tool and the HuMor morpho-syntactic parser.",
        "A lexicon has been built that contained all of the 163 000 different word-forms and a 15 000-word-long list of named entities, mainly proper nouns occurring in the corpus.",
        "Either since HuMor could not produce some of the attributes needed for MSD encoding or because the results of this automatic tool were sometimes incorrect, linguists had to manually check the lexicon and create a relatively large list of exceptions.",
        "Most of this work was based on the Hungarian Explanatory Dictionary (Juhasz, Szoke, Nagy, and Kovalovszky, 1972), however annotators had to rely on their intuition in a large number of neologies.",
        "Finally, the whole text was re-parsed using the created exception dictionary.",
        "To make the manual annotation easier, a software tool was written.",
        "Annotators worked on 400-500-sentence-long pieces of the corpus.",
