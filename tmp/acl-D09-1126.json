        "Deep grammars return parses that map transparently to semantic analyses, allowing information extraction systems to deal directly with content representations.",
        "Usually, this mapping is lexically specified, by linking lexical entries to semantic analyses.",
        "This property, lexicalisation, is central to some of the linguistic theories behind deep grammars, particularly Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) and Lexicalised Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1999).",
        "Lexicalisation can also help deep grammars achieve satisfactory parse times.",
        "Lexicalised grammars use few rules, which simply manipulate the lexical categories.",
        "The categories can be quickly assigned in a supertagging pre-process, dramatically reducing the search space the parser must explore (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is well suited to this strategy, and Clark and Curran (2007) have highlighted the division of labour between the parser and the supertagger as one of the critical aspects of their approach to statistical CCG parsing.",
        "In their system, the division is managed with parameters that control how many categories the parser's chart is seeded with.",
        "But even if the parser is only given one category per word, it still has a lot of freedom – because the grammar it uses is not fully lexicalised.",
        "In a fully lexicalised CCG grammar, modifier categories refer to the category of their head.",
        "This category does not necessarily represent the head's constituent type.",
        "For instance, the category of an adverb like still depends on whether it is modifying a predicate verb (1), or a clausal adjunct (2):",
        "(2) The lion waited, lying still",
        "Analyses like these are problematic because the training data is unlikely to include examples of each word in every syntactic environment that requires a new category.",
        "Hockenmaier and Steed-man's (2007) solution was to add category specific phrase-structure rules to the grammar, which disrupts the linguistic principles of the formalism, and introduces over-generation and ambiguity as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This paper proposes a new way to balance lexical and grammatical ambiguity in CCG.",
        "We introduce an extension to the formalism that allows type-changing rules to be lexically specified.",
        "The extension adds a new field to the category objects, and one additional rule to utilise it.",
        "This allows the formalism to express type-changing operations in a theoretically desirable way.",
        "Lexically specifying the type-changing rules reduces the ambiguity in the grammar substantially, which leads to substantial improvements in parsing efficiency.",

        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steed-man, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar formalism based on categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953).",
        "CCG can be distinguished from other CG extensions, such as categorial type-logic (Moortgat, 1997) by its attention to linguistic minimalism.",
        "One aim of the theory is to explain universal constraints on natural language syntax, so the generative power of the formalism is intended to closely match what natural language seems to require.",
        "Steedman and Baldridge (2007) argue that the requirements can be fulfilled almost entirely by two basic rule types: application and composition.",
        "Direction specific instances of these types yields a grammar that consists of just six rules.",
        "Initially, it seemed that some of the rules had to be restricted to certain contexts, particularly in languages that did not allow scrambling.",
        "Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) have since shown that rules could be restricted lexically, using a hierarchy of slash subtypes.",
        "This relieved the need for any language specific meta-rules, allowing CCG to offer a completely universal grammar, and therefore a theory of the innate human language faculty.",
        "With a universal grammar, language specific variation is confined to the lexicon.",
        "A CCG lexical category is either an atomic type, like N, or a function that specifies an argument in a particular direction, and a result, like S\\NP (where S is the result, NP the argument, and \\ indicates the argument must be found to the left).",

        "The practical need for this has been known since at least Hockenmaier (2003), who introduced a type-changing mechanism into CCGbank in order to control the problem referred to as modifier category proliferation.",
        "We briefly describe the problem, and then the prominent solutions that have been proposed.",
        "Unlike formalisms like LTAG and HPSG, CCG does not use different grammatical rules for arguments and adjuncts.",
        "Instead, modifier categories take the form Xj \\Xj, where X is the category of the constituent being modified, and the subscript indicates that the result should inherit from the argument via unification.",
        "The modifier can then use the application rule to attach to its head, and return the head unchanged:",
        "unusually here modifies the predicative adjective resilient, attaching it as an argument using forward application.",
        "This prevents resilient from having to subcategorise for adjuncts, since they are optional.",
        "The problem is that unusually must subcategorise for the function of its head.",
        "If resilient changes function and becomes a noun modifier, its modifiers must change category too:",
        "There is often a way to analyse around the need for type-changing operations in CCG.",
        "However, these solutions tend to cause new difficulties, and the resulting category ambiguity is quite problematic (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).",
        "The fact is that form-to-function coercions are quite common in English, so the grammar needs a way to have a constituent be modified according to its form, before undergoing a type-change to its function category.",
        "One way to describe the problem is to say that CCG categories have an overextended domain of locality (Joshi, 1999), the part of the derivation that it describes.",
        "A category should specify all and only the dependencies it governs, but CCG modifier categories are often forced to specify their heads' dependencies as well.",

        "This section completes the motivation of the paper by arguing that the existing proposals for type-changing are linguistically unsatisfactory, practically difficult, or a combination of the two.",
        "Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) includes a brief discussion of the modifier category proliferation problem, and introduces unary phrase-structure rules to address the situation.",
        "Figure 2 shows two such rules.",
        "The <S[dcl] M\\ArP>rule allows the reduced relative clause, it has happened, to be analysed as a modifier without affecting the category any modifiers that might attach to it.",
        "The other PSG type-changing rule in the derivation, <, NP – > S\\S> enables the extraposition, using the punctuation to make the rule more precise.",
        "One alternative to type-changing rules here would be to have time subcategorise for the clause, with a category like NP/S[dcl}.",
        "This would capture the constraint that only a restricted subset of nouns can be extracted as adjuncts in this way.",
        "The problem is that the extra argument would interfere with the attachment of adjuncts like this week to the NP, because the NP\\NP category cannot be allowed to participate in backwards cross-composition rules (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003).",
        "There are 204 type-changing PSG rules in the training partition of CCGbank.",
        "53 of the frequent rules transform produce modifier categories, 48 of them transforming verbal categories.",
        "The PSG",
        "Phrase-structure rules are presented in bottom-up notation.",
        "rules also handle a variety of other constructions, such as form/function discrepancies like gerund nominals.",
        "By far the most frequent rule, with 115,333 occurrences, is <N – > NP>, which transforms bare nominals into noun phrases.",
        "Steedman and Baldridge (2007) describes the CCG grammar as consisting of just 6 language universal combinatory rules, plus two lexical operations (type raising).",
        "Not only do the 204 category specific type-changing rules in CCGbank make the grammar ambiguous, they also run contrary to the design principles of the formalism.",
        "CCG is a linguistically motivated formalism, which means it is not only interested in providing a convenient, computable notation for grammar development.",
        "In addition, it constitutes a hypothesis about the nature of the human language faculty.",
        "Like other lexicalised formalisms, part of the theory is that it is the grammar that is innate, and the lexicon is acquired.",
        "If the grammar is innate, it must be language universal, confining all language specific variation to the lexicon.",
        "Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) described how the remaining language specific grammatical constraints described by Steedman (2000) could be controlled in the lexicon, using multi-modal slashes that have since become integrated into the main body of the theory (Steedman and Baldridge, 2007).",
        "In addition to being linguistically undesirable, the PSG rules in CCGbank produce practical difficulties.",
        "Every additional rule increases ambiguity, motivating the C&C system to choose to implement only the most frequent.",
        "This decreases the parser's coverage, and introduces another dimension of domain sensitivity.",
        "For instance, the type-changing rule that allows gerund nominals, <S[ng]\\NP – > NP>, occurs roughly 300 times in the training data.",
        "The parser does not implement this rule, so if it is ported to a new domain, where the construction is frequent, the rule will have to be added.",
        "Presumably, the parser would also benefit from the removal of rules which are infrequent in some new, target domain.",
        "The restricted set of psg rules the parser does implement results in considerable added ambiguity to the grammar.",
        "Figure 1 shows how the rules interact to produce over-generation.",
        "The psg rules are also a barrier to the semantic transparency of the theory, one of its most attractive properties for natural language engineering.",
        "ccg derivations are isomorphic to semantic analyses, because the derivation instantiates dependencies between ccg categories that can be paired with semantic categories.",
        "This isomorphism is disrupted by the addition of psg rules, since the grammar is no longer lexicalised.",
        "Often, the rules can be semantically annotated, restoring the isomorphism; but sometimes, this cannot be done.",
        "For instance, the extraposition rule in Figure 2 transforms the NP category into S\\S.",
        "There is no syntactic argument on the NP category to map the dependency to, so the dependency cannot be created (and is in fact missing from CCGbank).",
        "The CCGbank psg extension is closely related to the zero morpheme categories proposed by Aone and Wittenburg (1990), which they suggest be compiled into unary type-changing rules for processing.",
        "At first glance, it seems that conceptualising the rules as zero morphemes offers a way to locate them in the lexicon, avoiding the linguistic difficulties of having a language-specific grammar.",
        "However, ccg aims to provide a transparent interface between the surface form and the semantic analysis, so epsilon categories, traces, movement rules and other unrealised structures are explicitly banned (Steedman, 2000).",
        "From a processing standpoint, if zero morpheme categories are not compiled into phrase-structure rules, then they will complicate the category assignment phase considerably, since we can no longer assume that exactly one category will be assigned per word.",
        "We are not aware of any proposal for how this difficulty might be overcome.",
        "Carpenter (1992) provides a different suggestion for how sparse modifier categories can be accommodated.",
        "His solution is to use meta-rules that systematically expand the lexicon, much like the lexical rules used in hpsg (Flickinger, 1987), which exploit structural regularities to ensure that the lexicon is more complete.",
        "The problem with this is that it does not actually make the category set less sparse, so the su-pertagger's task is just as difficult.",
        "The only advantage is that its dictionary will be more complete.",
        "This is important, but does not solve the underlying inefficiency in the grammar: ccg categories have an overextended domain of locality, because they cannot represent form and function simultaneously.",

        "The derivs model uses features calculated over the derivations, while the hybrid model uses features calculated on the dependency structures.",
        "However, unlike the deps model Clark and Curran (2007) describe, the hybrid model uses two sets of derivation-based constraints.",
        "One set are the normal form constraints, as described by Eisner (1996).",
        "It also uses constraints that prevent the parser from using productions that were not seen in the training data.",
        "The hybrid model is slightly more accurate, but also slightly slower, because the dependency-based decoding is less efficient.",
        "All of the systems were within 0.5% in accuracy on the development set, with one exception.",
        "The hat+tr version performed very poorly with the hybrid model, while its performance with the derivs model was comparable to the other systems.",
        "The same drop in performance occurs on the evaluation set.",
        "We do not currently have a convincing explanation for this, but we presume it is the result of some unforeseen interaction between the removal of the type-raising rules from the grammar and the dependency-based features.",
        "The accuracy results on the test data, Section 23, saw similar trends, except that the gap between the hat systems and the original CCGbank increased slightly.",
        "The CCGbank hybrid model was only 0.1% more accurate than the hat hybrid model on Section 00, but is 0.5% more accurate on Section 23.",
        "Table 2 compares the parse speeds for the lexicalised hat corpora against a parser trained on the original CCGbank, using the two models.",
        "Exactly the same settings were used to obtain parse times as were used in the accuracy experiments.",
        "The experiments were all performed on a single core 2.6GHz Pentium 4 Xeon.",
        "Speeds are reported as words parsed per second.",
        "On both Section 00 and Section 23, with both the derivs and hybrid models, the hat system was substantially faster than the original parser.",
        "The hat+tr system was faster than the hat system using automatic pos tags, and slightly faster on Section 00.",
        "The hat categories allow quite favourable tradeoffs between speed and accuracy to be made.",
        "The original models allow us to parse with automatic pos tags at 480 words per second with 85.27% accuracy with the hybrid model, or at 544 words per second with 84.86% accuracy using the derivs model.",
        "Using the hat derivs model, we could instead parse at 827 words per second with 84.76% accuracy, or at 906 words per second and 84.67% accuracy using the hat+tr system.",
        "In summary, the hat and CCGbank derivs models are equivalent in accuracy, but the hat version is 52% faster.",
        "The CCGbank hybrid model remains the most accurate, but there will also be many tasks where the 88% improvement in speed will make it worth using the hat+tr derivs parser instead of the CCGbank hybrid model, at a cost of 0.6% accuracy."

        "These productions are generally symptomatic of problematic analyses, and are difficult to address automatically because they do not conform to any consistent pattern.",
        "We have omitted the hat+TR corpus in these figures, because it only differs from the the hat corpus with respect to type-raising productions.",

        "The lexicalised type-changing scheme we have proposed offers many opportunities for favourable analyses, because it allows form and function to be represented simultaneously.",
        "However, we have limited our changes to replacing the existing CCGbank non-combinatory rules.",
        "This allows us to compare the two strategies for controlling modifier category proliferation more closely, but still offers some improved analyses.",
        "The most frequent unary production in CCGbank, the N^NP rule, ensures that nominals can always take the N category, so adjectives seldom need to be assigned NP/NP.",
        "Because adjectives and nouns are open class, and bare noun phrases are fairly common, this reduction in category sparseness is quite important.",
        "Lexicalising the type changing rule forces the head noun to acquire a different category, but does ensure that its modifiers can attach at the N level – which is also more linguistically desirable:",

        "The non-finite clause is functioning as an adnominal, but its modifier is able to select its canonical category.",
        "One of the advantages of the CCGbank phrase-structure rules is that they allow the corpus to include derivations for which no valid CCG parse can be formed.",
        "The c&c parser has difficulty taking advantage of these extra sentences, however, because only so many of the arbitrary binary PSG rules can be added to the grammar without making it too ambiguous.",
        "Once these rules are lexicalised, the categories that produce them can be added to the lexicon as unexceptional, albeit rare, cases."

      "text": [
        "Lexicalised grammars represent most of the information in a derivation with a sequence of lexical categories.",
        "Traditional CCG analyses require redundancy between categories whenever there is nested modification, which suggests that such analyses will encounter sparse data problems.",
        "While the addition of phrase-structure rules prevents this proliferation of modifier categories, it does so at a high price.",
        "The bulk of the type-changing rules in CCGbank are not implemented in the c&c parser, because to do so would increase the ambiguity in the grammar enormously.",
        "CCG parsers must carefully manage ambiguity, because there are many ways to bracket the same CCG derivation.",
        "Even with a restricted set of PSG rules, the C&C parser experiences very large chart sizes.",
        "In addition to making the grammar more ambiguous, the PSG rules make it less theoretically sound, and more difficult to produce semantic analyses from the parser's output.",
        "We have show how CCG analyses can be fully lexicalised in a way that closely mirrors the introduction of phrase-structure rules.",
        "The result is a corpus that produces faster, accurate parsers, is well suited for domain adaptation, and allows for more transparent semantic analysis.",
        "We can also use the same mechanism to lexically specify type-raising, the first concrete proposal to handle type-raising as a lexical transformation we are aware of.",
        "From an immediate, empirical perspective, we have substantially improved the parsing speed of what is already the fastest deep parser available.",
        "Improvements in parsing efficiency are important in making parsing a practical technology, since the volume of text we have available for processing is growing even faster than the processing resources we have available."
