        "This paper describes a new interpretation of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) that allows the embedding of TAG in the unification framework in a manner consistent with the declarative approach taken in this framework.",
        "In the new interpretation we present in this paper, the objects manipulated by a TAG are considered to be descriptions of trees.",
        "This is in contrast to the traditional view that in a TAG the composition operations of adjoining and substitution combine trees.",
        "Borrowing ideas from Description Theory, we propose quasi-trees as a means to represent partial descriptions of trees.",
        "Using quasi-trees, we are able to justify the definition of feature structureâ€“ based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG) that was first given in Vijay-Shanker (1987) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1988).",
        "In the definition of the FTAG formalism given here, we argue that a grammar manipulates descriptions of trees (i.e., quasi-trees); whereas the structures derived by a grammar are trees that are obtained by taking the minimal readings of such descriptions.",
        "We then build on and refine the earlier version of FTAG, give examples that illustrate the usefulness of embedding TAG in the unification framework, and present a logical formulation (and its associated semantics) of FTAG that shows the separation between descriptions of well-formed structures and the actual structures that are derived, a theme that is central to this work.",
        "Finally, we discuss some questions that are raised by our new interpretation of the TAG formalism: questions dealing with the nature and definition of the adjoining operation (in contrast to substitution), its relation to multicomponent adjoining, and the distinctions between auxiliary and initial structures."

        "The elementary trees in a TAG correspond to minimal linguistic structures that localize the dependencies such as subcategoriza-tion, and filler-gap.",
        "There are two kinds of elementary trees: initial trees and auxiliary trees.",
        "Originally, initial trees (e.g., al and a2 in Figure 1) were defined to correspond to minimal sentential structures.",
        "Therefore, the root of an initial tree was required to be labeled by the symbol S. With the advent of lexicalized TAG and the use of the substitution operation, this assumption is no longer made (see a3).",

        "The adjoining operation is used to compose trees.",
        "An auxiliary tree, whose root and foot node are labeled A, can be adjoined at a node that is also labeled A. Adjoining may be described as follows: the subtree below the node of adjunction is excised; the auxiliary tree is inserted in its place; and the excised subtree is substituted at the foot node of the inserted auxiliary tree.",
        "Figure 3 shows the result of adjoining /31 at the VP node in al (to yield 'yl) as well as the adjunction of /32 in a2 to yield -y2.",

        "Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar (MCTAG) differs from (the traditional definition of) TAG in that the elementary objects of the grammar are sets of trees rather than trees, and multicomponent adjoining involves the composition of these elementary sets of trees' (rather than elementary trees).",
        "See Joshi (1987) for more details on Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammars (MCTAG).",
        "The multicomponent sets, given in Figure 16, may be used to give an account for sentences (1) and (2).",
        "Obtained by adjoining the two components of /317 in a15t N can be used for sentence (1) (Figure 17).",
        "The need for introducing multicomponent sets and multicomponent adjoining (in this case, at least) arises because of the decision in traditional TAGs to compose trees (rather than descriptions of trees, i.e., quasi-trees).",
        "In particular, the domination relations allow us to give partial descriptions of trees such as a16 (in Figure 18) that captures the same information as in the multicomponent set /317 (in Figure 16).",
        "Note that a16 can be described by using the same principles that relate a13 and a12 (see Figure 14).",
        "If, for a moment, we consider a15 to be an auxiliary quasi-tree (rather than an initial quasi-tree) and use it for \"adjoining\" (treating the n2 quasi-node as the quasi-foot) then we obtain the same structure as ry8 (Figure 17).",
        "Two issues can be raised with respect to this example.",
        "Firstly we can question whether such uses of multicomponent adjoining (and where the foot node of one component dominates the root of the other components in the eventual structures) can be considered to be adjoining in the quasi-tree framework; and secondly whether these operations can be thought of as essentially the substitution operation when viewed in this framework (that uses quasi-trees rather than trees).",
        "However, a15 would normally be called an initial quasi-tree, and we would have considered substitution at the n2 quasi-node rather than treating a15 as an auxiliary quasi-tree and the n2 quasi-node as the quasi-foot.",
        "Nevertheless, this \"adjunction\" of a15 seems to be really playing the role of substitution (with a sub-quasi tree though).",
        "Addressing the first issue, in the case of the multicomponent adjoining example used here, we believe the need for multicomponent adjoining arises from the fact that objects being composed were defined to be trees.",
        "Even in the previous version of FTAG, it was assumed that the objects being composed were trees despite the fact that two feature structures were associated with each node.",
        "These top and bottom feature structures associated with a node were supposed to account for a view of that node from two different perspectives (from the top and from below).",
        "However,",

        "That is, we could not consider the possibility of a node whose top and bottom parts were labeled by S and NP.",
        "Therefore, instead of using one quasi-tree (a16), a multicomponent set, 1317, composed of two trees is used.",
        "Assuming the possibility of stating domination between quasi-nodes with different labels (as in ct16), we can similarly extend the definition of \"auxiliary quasi-trees\" to allow for the quasi-root and quasi-foot nodes being labeled differently.",
        "This is the assumption we made when we \"adjoined\" the quasi-tree o15 to capture the effect of multicomponent adjoining.",
        "Assuming that (2E15 is an auxiliary structure points out the similarities between multicomponent adjoining and adjoining.",
        "However, it is more natural to assume it is an initial quasi-tree and use substitution at the object NP node (rather than call ce15 an auxiliary quasi-tree and n2 quasi-node, without any justification, a quasi-foot).",
        "A similar situation arises when we consider the so-called complement auxiliary trees (see Kroch [1987]).",
        "019, an elementary quasi-tree anchored by a verb such as \"think,\" would be defined to be a complement auxiliary quasi-tree because the quasi-foot is present due to the subcategorization requirements of the anchor.",

        "Derivations in MCTAG.",

        "This is consistent with Figure 19 where we could call 1319 an initial quasi-tree and substitute ct12 at the supposed quasi-foot (52) to derive a structure for Peter thinks John saw Mary.",
        "However, a quasi-tree such as 019 must be treated as an auxiliary structure in order that we could use it for adjoining so that it can be adjoined in a18 (see Figure 18) at the pair (s3, s4) to derive a structure for who did Peter think John saw.",
        "The question about the basis of deciding when one should call an elementary structure auxiliary or initial remains.",
        "It is hard to justify that s2 quasi-node of /319 is the quasi-foot on the basis of factoring of recursion (the original reason for introducing auxiliary structures).",
        "However, while developing a grammar, the 52 node in /319 is not expanded further because we wish to factor recursion, but because it is required by the subcategorization of the anchor and such nodes are expanded as a result of a derivation step.",
        "Among the quasi-nodes that appear in the frontier of 019, the s2 quasi-node is called the quasi-foot because extraction cannot occur from a tree that can appear below the subject NP quasi-node, whereas it can in the case of s2 quasi-node.",
        "However, on this basis, one could also call a15 an auxiliary quasi-tree and state that the n2 quasi-node is the quasi-foot.",
        "Structures such as 019 and am (of Figure 20) raise the question of whether there is an essential difference between initial and (complement) auxiliary quasi-trees, and whether adjoining is only a special form of substitution.",
        "It appears that in the case of the two examples above, we came to the situation of calling certain structures auxiliary",
        "Initial or auxiliary?",
        "structures solely for the purpose of using the adjoining operation.",
        "If we wish to claim that there is no essential difference between initial and auxiliary structures (at least of the complement auxiliary tree variety), then we must account for the apparent difference between substitution and adjoining operations.",
        "We argue now that it may not be necessary to make this distinction if we take a closer look at the adjoining and substitution operations.",
        "Recall that the substitution operation was defined by the identification of two quasi-nodes.",
        "So far this has been illustrated by identifying a quasi-node that appears in the frontier of a quasi-tree with the quasi-root of another quasi-tree.",

        "Adjoining seen as substitution.",

        "If we insist that the resulting structure must describe a tree, then we must have either s1 dominate s3 or s3 dominate s1.",
        "Now suppose there are some fundamental linguistic principles (perhaps those principles that govern the makeup of elementary structures and hence also the characteristics of the domination link between paired quasi-nodes) that determine that it is the case that s3 must dominate s1 and not vice versa.",
        "In this case we obtain 79 (as shown in Figure 21), a structure obtained by \"adjoining\" 019.",
        "In fact, that s3 must dominate s1 must be derivable from any reasonable linguistic theory that is used to produce the elementary structures concerned (for otherwise a wrong sequence of words would be predicted).",
        "One possible explanation of why s3 dominates si could be given by importing a device like the functional uncertainty machinery (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988) used in LFG.",
        "The treatment used in LFG, when imported here, would suggest that zero or more structures of the form given by 019 would fit in the gap specified by the domination link between s3 and s4.",
        "Thus when the identification of s2 and s4 takes place, s3 must dominate si and again zero or more structures of the form of /319 could fit between s3 and si now (see Joshi and Vijay-Shanker [1989]) for a discussion of the treatment of long-distance dependency in TAG and LFG).",
        "Another way to explain the domination of s3 over si could be done by using the notions of maximal government domains discussed by Kroch (1989) and using it now to define the characteristics of the domination links such as that between s3 and 54.",
        "Note that once the nature of the adjoining operation has been derived, one can pre-compile out the linguistic principles and machinery used to express it.",
        "Thus even if one uses, say, the functional uncertainty machinery or maximal government domains, these additional devices (used during the developmental stages) of the grammar need not be used again during the derivation process once we have derived the adjoining operation.",
        "This is analogous to the situation with elementary structures.",
        "Some linguistic theory will be involved in defining the elementary structures of a TAG.",
        "However, once the grammar has been developed, these principles are no longer directly involved during the derivation phase.",

        "Suppose there is some principle that predicts this situation to occur when substitution takes place; then we can conclude that adjoining is not a fundamental operation in itself but rather a derived operation.",
        "Trying to capture the above-mentioned principle would involve specifying the characteristics of the domination link between pairs of quasi-nodes such as that specified by c1 and b3 and the makeup of elementary structures of a grammar.",
        "Let us now consider the other case.",
        "Suppose we substitute at the b1 node with the quasi-tree rooted by b3; there is no reason to assume that c1 must dominate al.",

        "First, a20 may appear above all of a22 as indicated by This appears to correspond to the version of multicomponent adjoining where different components of a set ({a20, c20}) are adjoined simultaneously into another multicomponent set, ({c:42, ct22}).",
        "Other possibilities include c40 and c42 splintered into some number of pieces (depending on the domination links found in them) and interleaved in a more complex fashion.",
        "To summarize, when we substitute at bi by identifying it with a quasi-root of another structure, we have the standard substitution.",
        "On the other hand, when we substitute at b1 by identifying b1 and b3, if ci dominates al then the resulting structure appears to be the one formed after adjunction.",
        "When al dominates c1 the situation seems to be comparable with that of multicomponent adjoining, where a20 and a22 are multicomponent sets made up of ceci, a20 and cE2, oG, respectively.",
        "Such multicomponent adjoining has been used previously in providing linguistic analyses.",
        "Since both cases occur (a1 dominates c1 or vice versa), we believe it only further justifies our claim that in situations where we consider substitutions as above, whether we have c1 dominating al (adjoining) or not (multi-component adjoining) depends on the linguistic principles being instantiated during the development of elementary structures (and",

        "â€¢ vp2 quasi-node immediately dominates the v2 quasi-node (i.e., path length=1).",
        "â€¢ Since v1 and v2 quasi-nodes are identified and since we insist on a tree",
        "structure, we have vpi and vp2 quasi-nodes in the domination relation.",
        "In fact vpi quasi-node must dominate vp2 quasi-node in the resulting structure by a path of length 0 or more (from the two observations above).",
        "Thus we get the structure given by cr23 as desired.",
        "Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (1992) describe a proof system that can be used to perform the type of reasoning involved in constructing the structure a23 as described above.",
        "In the manner described above we can build the default structure for every subcategorization frame.",
        "Such structures will be specified in any lexicalized TAG; the difference (in the envisaged specification method) is that we no longer precompile out",
        "K. Vijay-Shanker Using Descriptions of Trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar all possibilities (thus repeating the structure 712 in all structures associated with every type of verb).",
        "To complete the description of the rest of the elementary quasi-trees one would have to use transformations, meta-rules, or lexical rules to specify the structures for passivization, wh-movement, topicalization, etc.",
        "Work along this direction is being carried out (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992)."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have embedded TAG in the unification framework in a manner consistent with the constraint-based approach used in this framework.",
        "Starting from first principles and taking the localization of dependencies within the elementary structures of a TAG grammar as the only basic principle, we have argued that the objects manipulated by such a grammar are not trees but descriptions of well-formed syntactic structures.",
        "From D-Theory, we have adopted the use of domination relation and use of identifiers to refer to nodes while describing such structures.",
        "Quasi-trees were introduced to depict pictorially partial descriptions of trees.",
        "The pairing of quasi-nodes (with domination link between them) was then used to explain the association of two feature structures with individual nodes in previous definition of Feature structureâ€“ based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG).",
        "In fact, we also show that the formalism defined in Harbusch (1990) (where only one feature structure is associated with every node) turns out to be similar to the use of FTAG with an additional decision to merge every pair of quasi-nodes by default.",
        "We argue that such defaults lead to nonmonotonic behavior.",
        "One can now view FTAG as a generalization of TAG in that arbitrary categories (as used in GPSG) can label nodes, instead of just atomic symbols (nonterminals) as in TAG.",
        "In fact, by not insisting that a pair of quasi-nodes be labeled by the same category in FTAG, as was done in TAG, we argue that the \"adjoining constraints\" follow from the definition of adjunction and the labeling of quasi-nodes, thus making unnecessary the stipulations of SA and OA constraints.",
        "In addition, contrary to the assumptions made in current literature on TAG, we show that there are two possible interpretations of NA constraints, only one of which is a special case of SA constraint.",
        "We note that as the information associated with quasi-nodes grows during derivation, \"adjoining constraints\" get instantiated dynamically in an FTAG.",
        "We make use of this property in order to give examples to show how FTAG can give more succinct descriptions than TAG.",
        "We have given a logical formulation of FTAG.",
        "This builds on a similar treatment of FUG given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer.",
        "We view this logical formulation as a description of those trees and associated feature structures that are built by CFG-based unification grammars.",
        "Unlike a CFG-based formalism that allows only for substitution operation, for an FTAG one has to depict adjunction in addition to substitution.",
        "Our treatment captures both these cases.",
        "We end by giving a presentation of the semantics that can be used to give the denotation of a grammar, i.e., in our case, the structures derived by a grammar.",
        "We have emphasized throughout the paper that we are only interested in the definition of the FTAG formalism.",
        "In particular, we have not been concerned with linguistic analyses.",
        "However, we have raised a few questions about the formalism that we believe can only be answered on linguistic grounds.",
        "In the context of the new interpretation, some of these include whether the linguistic uses of multicomponent adjoining can be simulated as the adjoining operation; whether there is an essential need to divide the elementary structures of the grammar as initial and auxiliary structures; and whether the adjoining operation itself can be defined as a substitution",
        " operation, the apparent differences between these operations being derived on the basis of some more fundamental linguistic principles used in the design of the elementary structures of the grammar.",
        "Even if the answer is in the affirmative, we believe there is considerable advantage to be gained by deriving this operation in order that we can manipulate directly the elementary structures that localize various forms of the dependencies.",
        "As observed earlier, with the derivation of this operation (like the derivation of the elementary structures of the grammar), we can disregard (i.e., not reason with) the principles used (to derive them) during the derivation of more complex structures.",
        "Finally we have also shown that the new interpretation of the TAG formalism proposed here allows for the possibility of a more compact representation of a TAG grammar."
