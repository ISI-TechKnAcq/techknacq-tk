        "Even if the syntactic and semantic content of a request is correct, 30 that a natural language front end can derive a coherent representation of its meaning, its pragmatic content or the structure of the underlying system may make any direct response to the request impossible or misleading.",
        "According to Sondheimer and Weischedel (Sondheimer, 1980), an input exhibits pragmatic overshoot if the representation of its meaning is beyond the capabilities of the underlying system.",
        "Kaplan (1979), Mays (1980a), and Carberry (1984) have each worked on strategies for dealing with particular classes of such pragmatic failures.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of identifying the most significant reason that a plan to achieve a user goal cannot be carried out.",
        "The approach to pragmatic failure taken in this paper is to use a planner to verify the presumptions in a request.",
        "The presumptions behind a request become the subgoals of a plan to fulfill the request.",
        "Using Mays' (1980a) example, the query \"Which faculty members take courses?\"",
        "is here handled as an instance of an IDENTIFY-SET-MEMBERS",

        "• Unix is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.",
        "goal, and the pragmatics of the query are checked by looking for a plan to achieve that goal.",
        "Determining both that faculty members and courses do exist and that faculty members can take courses are subgoals within that plan.",
        "A presuppositional failure is noted if the planner is unable to complete a plan for the goal.",
        "Furthermore, information for recovery procesa-ing or explanatory responses can be derived directly from the failed plan by identifying whatever blocked goal in the planning tree of subgoals is most significant.",
        "Thus, in the example above, if the planner failed because it was unable to show that faculty can take courses, the helpful response would be to explain this presumption failure.",
        "We concentrate here on identifying the significant blocks rather than on generating natural language responses.",
        "The examples in this paper will be drawn from a planning system intended to function as the pragmatic overshoot component of a cooperative natural language interface to the Unix operating system.",
        "We chose Unix, much as Wilensky (1982) did for his Unix Consultant, as a familiar domain that was still complex enough to require interesting planning.",

        "(The planner must check all the branches of an AND node, even after one fails, to know which is most significant to report.)",
        "For instance, if all three of the children of PRINT-FILE in our example fail, (IS-TEXT-FILE ?file) is the one that should be reported, since it is least likely that the user can affect that node.",

        "Unix's actual behavior, which reports the first problem that it happens to discover in trying to execute the command, is often frustrating for exactly that reason.",
        "This heuristic of reporting the most serious failure at an AND node is closely related to ABSTRIP's use of \"criticality\" numbers to divide a planner into levels of abstraction, so that the most critical features are dealt with first (Sacerdoti, 1974).",
        "The situation is different at OR nodes, where only a single child has to succeed.",
        "Here the most serious failure can safely be ignored, as long as some other branch can be repaired.",

        "In our example, READ-PERM-USER should usually be reported rather than READ-PERM-SUPER-USER, if both have failed, since most users have more hope of changing the former than the latter.",
        "There is a duality here between the AND and OR node heuristics that is like the duality in the minimax evaluation of a move in a game tree, where one picks the best score at nodes where the choice is one's own, and the worst score at nodes where the opponent gets to choose."

        "The surprise score of a successful node is defined as 1.0 minus the success ratio, so that the success of a node like IS-TEXT-FILE, that almost always succeeds, is less surprising than the success of UP-AND-RUNNING.",
        "Failed nodes get negative surprise scores, with the absolute value of the score again reflecting the amount of surprise.",
        "The surprise score of a failed node is set to the negative of the success ratio, so that the failure of IS-TEXT-FILE would be more surprising than that of UP-AND-RUNNING, and that would be reflected by a more strongly negative score.",
        "Here is an example of our PRINT-FILE plan instantiated for an unlucky user who has failed on all but two preconditions, with surprise scores added:",
        "Note that the success of USER-READ-PERM-BIT-SET is not very surprising, since that node almost always succeeds; the failure of a node like READ-PERM-SUPER-USER, which seldom succeeds, is much less surprising than the failure of UP-AND-RUNNING.",
        "We suggest keeping statistics and deriving surprise scores because we believe that they provide a useful if imperfect handle on judging the significance of failed nodes.",
        "Regarding OR nodes, strongly negative surprise scores identify branches that in the past experience of the system have usually succeeded, and these are the beat guesses to be likely to succeed again.",
        "Thus READ-PERM-USER, the child of READ-PERM with the most strongly negative score, turns out to be the most likely to be tractable.",
        "The negative surprise scores at a failed OR node give a profile of the typical success ratios; to select the nodes that are generally most likely to succeed, we pick the most surprising failures, those with the most strongly negative surprise scores.",
        "At AND nodes, on the other hand, the goal is to identify the branch that is most critical, that is, least likely to succeed.",
        "Surprisingly, we find that the most critical branch tends in this case also to be the most surprising failure.",
        "In our example, IS-TEXT-FILE, which the user can do nothing about, is the most surprising failure under PRINT-FILE, READ-PERM is next most surprising, and UP-AND-RUNNING, for which simply waiting often works, comes last.",
        "Therefore at AND nodes, like at OR nodes, we will report the child with the most negative surprise score; at AND nodes, this tends to identify the most critical failures, while at OR nodes, it tends to select the most hopeful.",
        "Note that the combined effect of the AND and OR strategies is to choose from among all the failed nodes those that were statistically most likely to succeed.",
        "The main advantage of the statistical surprise score strategy is its low cost, both to design and execute.",
        "Another nice feature is the self-adjusting character of the surprise scores, based as they are on success statistics that the system updates on an ongoing basis.",
        "For example, the likelihood of GROUP-READ-PERM being reported would depend on how often that feature was used at a particular site.",
        "The main difficulty is that surprise scores are only a rough guide to the actual significance of a failed node.",
        "The true significance of a failure in the context of a particular command may depend on world knowledge that is beyond the grasp of the planning system (e.g., the laser printer is down for days this time rather than hours), or even on a part of the planning context itself that is not reflected in the statistical averages (e.g., READ-PERM-SUPER-USER is much more likely to succeed when READ-PERM is called as part of a system dump command than when it is called as part of PRINT-FILE).",
