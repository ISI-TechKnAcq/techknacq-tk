        "Automatic recognition of spoken letters is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer speech recognition.",
        "The difficulty of the task is due to the acoustic similarity of many of the letters.",
        "Accurate recognition requires the system to perform fine phonetic distinctions, such as B vs. D, B vs. P, D vs. T, T vs. G, C vs. Z, V vs. Z, M vs. N and J vs. K. The ability to perform fine phonetic distinctions – to discriminate among the minimal sound units of the language – is a fundamental unsolved problem in computer speech recognition.",
        "We describe two systems that apply speech knowledge and neural network classification to speaker-independent recognition of spoken letters.",
        "The first system, called EAR (English Alphabet Recognizer), recognizes letters spoken in isolation.",
        "First choice recognition accuracy is 96% correct on 30 test speakers.",
        "A second system locates and recognizes letters spoken with brief pauses between them.",
        "First choice recognition accuracy is 95.7% on 10 test speakers for letters correctly located.",
        "This system was used to retrieve spelled names from a database of 50,000 common last names.",
        "Of the 68 names spelled by ten test speakers, 65 were retrieved as the first choice, and the remaining three were the second choice.",
        "We attribute the high level of accuracy obtained by these systems to (a) accurate location of segment boundaries, which allows feature measurements to be computed in the most informative regions of the signal, (b) the use of speech knowledge to design feature measurement algorithms, and (c) the ability of neural network classifiers to model the variability in speech."

        "• Sonorant features were designed to discriminate among: (a) Letters with different vowels (e.g., E,",
        "A, 0); (b) letters with the same vowel with important information in the sonorant interval (e.g., L, M, N); and (c) letters with redundant information near the sonorant onset (e.g., B, D, E).",
        "Sonorant features include averaged spectra in seven equal intervals within the sonorant, additional spectral slices after vowel onset (to determine the place of articulation of a preceding consonant), and estimates of pitch and duration.",
        "• Pre-sonorant features were designed to discriminate among pre-vocalic consonants (e.g., V vs. Z, T vs. G) and to discriminate vowels with glottalized onsets from stops (e.g., E vs. B, A vs. K).",
        "These features include estimates of prevoicing, and spectra sampled within the STOP or ERIC preceding the SON.",
        "If no STOP or ERIC were found, features were computed on an interval 200 msec before the vowel.",
        "• Post-sonorant features were designed to discrim",
        "inate among F, S, X and H. Much of this information is captured by the contour features.",
        "The main post-sonorant feature is the spectrum at the point of maximum zero crossing rate within 200 msec after the sonorant.",
        "Letter Classification Letter classification is performed by fully connected feed–forward networks.",
        "The input to the first network consists of 617 feature values, normalized between 0 and 1.",
        "There are 52 hidden units in a single layer and 26 output units corresponding to the letters A through Z.",
        "The classification response of the first network is taken to be the neuron with the largest output response.",
