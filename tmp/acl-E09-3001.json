        "The algorithm proposed can be split into two main processes, automatic segmentation and word discovery.",

        "In its current state, the system is fully operational and intends to be used as a platform for further development and experiments.",
        "The experimental results are promising.",
        "However, it is clear to see that the model suffers from speaker-dependency issues.",
        "The problem can be split into two areas, front-end processing of the incoming acoustic signal and the representation of discovered lexical units in memory.",
        "Development is being carried out on various clustering techniques that build constantly evolving internal representations of internal lexical classes in an attempt to model speech variation.",
        "Additionally, a secondary update process, implemented as a reoccurring 'sleeping phase' is being investigated.",
        "This phase is going to allow the memory organisation to restructure itself by looking at events over a longer history, which could be carried out as a batch process.",
        "The processing of prosodic cues, such as speech rhythm and pitch intonation, will be incorporated within the algorithm to increase the key word detection accuracy and further exploit the richness of the learners surrounding environment.",
        "Adults, when speaking to infants, will highlight words of importance through infant directed speech (IDS).",
        "During IDS adults place more pitch variance on words that they want the infant to attend to.",
        "Further experiments have been planned to see if the model exhibits similar patterns of learning behaviour as young multiple language learners.",
        "Experiments will be carried out with the multiple languages available in the ACORNS database (English, Finnish and Dutch).",
