        "Several research groups have attempted to automate this process by collecting co-occurrence patterns (e.g., subject-verb-object patterns) from a large training corpus.",
        "These patterns are then used as the source of selectional constraints in analyzing new text.",
        "However, the patterns collected in this way involve specific word combinations from the training corpus.",
        "Unless the training corpus is very large, this will provide only limited coverage of the range of acceptable semantic combinations, even within a restricted domain.",
        "In order to obtain better coverage, it will be necessary to generalize from the patterns collected so that patterns with semantically related words will also be considered acceptable.",
        "In most cases this has been done by manually assigning words to semantic classes and then generalizing from specific words to their classes.",
        "This approach still implies a substantial manual burden in moving to a new domain, since at least some of the semantic word classes will be domain-specific.",
        "In order to fully automate the process of semantic constraint acquisition, we would like to be able to automatically identify semantically related words.",
        "This can be done using the co-occurrence data, by identifying words which occur in the same contexts (for example, verbs which occur with the same subjects and objects).",

        "Some constraints may be general (domain independent), but others will be specific to a particular domain.",

        "When these constraints were encoded by hand, they were normally stated as absolute constraints – aparticular combination of words was or was not acceptable.",
        "With corpus-derived constraints, on the other hand, it becomes possible to think in terms of a probabilistic model.",
        "For example, based on a training corpus, we would estimate the probability that a particular verb occurs with a particular subject and object (or with subject and object from particular classes), or that a verb occurs with a particular modifier.",
        "Then, using the (obviously crude) assumption of independent probabilities, we would estimate the probability of a particular sentence derivation as the product of the probabilities of all the operations (adding arguments to heads, adding modifiers to heads) required to produce the sentence, and the probability of a sentence as the sum of the probabilities of its derivations."

        "We have demonstrated that automated smoothing methods can be of some benefit in increasing the coverage of automatically acquired selectional constraints.",

        "It is still too early to assess the relative merits of different approaches to generalizing these selectional constraints, given our limited testing and the different evaluation metrics of the few others groups experimenting with such acquisition procedures.",
        "Our experimental results are not uniformly positive.",
        "We did achieve substantially higher recall levels with smoothing.",
        "On the other hand, over the range of recalls obtainable without smoothing, smoothing did not consistently improve the error rate.",
        "Therefore at present the principal benefit of the smoothing technique is to raise the recall beyond that possible using unsmoothed data.",
        "In addition, preliminary experiments with smoothing applied to the argument position in a triple indicate that the comparison between automated smoothing and manual classification hierarchies is not so favorable.",
        "This is not too surprising because when the classification hierarchy was initially created, its primary use was to specify the allowable values of arguments and modifiers in semantic case frames; as a result, while the hierarchy is of benefit in generalizing heads (as described above), it is more effective in generalizing the argument position.",
        "We recognize that the size of the corpus we have used is quite minimal for the task of computing similarities, since to get a fully populated similarity matrix we would require each pair of semantically related words to occur in several common contexts.",
        "We hope therefore to repeat these experiments with a substantially larger corpus in the near future.",
        "A larger corpus will also allow us to use larger patterns, including in particular subject-verb-object patterns, and thus reduce the confusion due to treating different words senses as common contexts."
