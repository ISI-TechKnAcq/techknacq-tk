        "Schiitze (1992) has pioneered work in the hierarchical clustering of word senses.",
        "In his disambiguation experiments, Schiitze used post-hoc alignment of clusters to word senses.",
        "Because the top-level cluster partitions based purely on distributional information do not necessarily align with standard sense distinctions, he generated up to 10 sense clusters and manually assigned each to a fixed sense label (based on the hand-inspection of 10-20 sentences per cluster).",
        "In contrast, our algorithm uses automatically acquired seeds to tie the sense partitions to the desired standard at the beginning, where it can be most useful as an anchor and guide.",
        "In addition, Schiitze performs his classifications by treating documents as a large unordered bag of words.",
        "By doing so he loses many important distinctions, such as collocational distance, word sequence and the existence of predicate-argument relationships between words.",
        "In contrast, our algorithm models these properties carefully, adding considerable discriminating power lost in other relatively impoverished models of language."

        "In essence, our algorithm works by harnessing several powerful, empirically-observed properties of language, namely the strong tendency for words to exhibit only one sense per collocation and per discourse.",
        "It attempts to derive maximal leverage from these properties by modeling a rich diversity of collocational relationships.",
        "It thus uses more discriminating information than available to algorithms treating documents as bags of words, ignoring relative position and sequence.",
        "Indeed, one of the strengths of this work is that it is sensitive to a wider range of language detail than typically captured in statistical sense-disambiguation algorithms.",
        "Also, for an unsupervised algorithm it works surprisingly well, directly outperforming Schiitze's unsupervised algorithm 96.7 % to 92.2 %, on a test of the same 4 words.",
        "More impressively, it achieves nearly the same performance as the supervised algorithm given identical training contexts (95.5 %",
        "vs. 96.1 %) , and in some cases actually achieves superior performance when using the one-sense-per-discourse constraint (96.5 % vs. 96.1%).",
        "This would indicate that the cost of a large sense-tagged training corpus may not be necessary to achieve accurate word-sense disambiguation."
