        "Information-extraction (IE), the process of generating relational data from natural-language text, continues to gain attention.",
        "Many researchers dream of creating a large repository of high-quality extracted tuples, arguing that such a knowledge base could benefit many important tasks such as question answering and summarization.",
        "Most approaches to IE use supervised learning of relation-specific examples, which can achieve high precision and recall.",
        "Unfortunately, however, fully supervised methods are limited by the availability of training data and are unlikely to scale to the thousands of relations found on the Web.",
        "A more promising approach, often called \"weak\" or \"distant\" supervision, creates its own training data by heuristically matching the contents of a database to corresponding text (Craven and Kum-lien, 1999).",
        "For example, suppose that r(e1,e2) = Founded( Jobs, Apple) is a ground tuple in the database and s =\"Steve Jobs founded Apple, Inc.\" is a sentence containing synonyms for both e1 = Jobs and e2 = Apple, then s may be a natural language expression of the fact that r(ei, e2) holds and could be a useful training example.",
        "While weak supervision works well when the textual corpus is tightly aligned to the database contents (e.g., matching Wikipedia infoboxes to associated articles (Hoffmann et al., 2010)), Riedel et al.",
        "(2010) observe that the heuristic leads to noisy data and poor extraction performance when the method is applied more broadly (e.g., matching Freebase records to NY Times articles).",
        "To fix this problem they cast weak supervision as a form of multi-instance learning, assuming only that at least one of the sentences containing ei and e2 are expressing r(e1,e2), and their method yields a substantial improvement in extraction performance.",
        "However, Riedel et al.",
        "'s model (like that of previous systems (Mintz et al., 2009)) assumes that relations do not overlap – there cannot exist two facts r(e1,e2) and q(e1,e2) that are both true for any pair of entities, e1 and e2.",
        "Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated; for example both Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple) are clearly true.",
        "Indeed, 18.3% of the weak supervision facts in Freebase that match sentences in the NY Times 2007 corpus have overlapping relations.",
        "This paper presents MultiR, a novel model of weak supervision that makes the following contributions:",
        "• MULTIR introduces a probabilistic, graphical model of multi-instance learning which handles overlapping relations.",
        "• MultiR also produces accurate sentence-level predictions, decoding individual sentences as well as making corpus-level extractions.",
        "• MultiR is computationally tractable.",
        "Inference reduces to weighted set cover, for which it uses a greedy approximation with worst case running time O(|R| • |S|) where R is the set of possible relations and S is largest set of sentences for any entity pair.",
        "In practice, MULTIR runs very quickly.",
        "• We present experiments showing that MULTIR outperforms a reimplementation of Riedel et al.",

        "This advantage comes from the decomposition that is possible with the deterministic OR aggregation variables.",

        "Although previous approaches have used more sophisticated features for aggregating the evidence from individual sentences, we demonstrate that aggregating strong sentence-level evidence with a simple deterministic OR that models overlapping relations is more effective, and also enables training ofasentence extractor that runs with no aggregate information.",
        "While the Riedel et al.",
        "approach does include a model of which sentences express relations, it makes significant use of aggregate features that are primarily designed to do entity-level relation predictions and has a less detailed model of extractions at the individual sentence level.",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, our model is able to do better at both the sentential and aggregate levels."

        "We argue that weak supervision is promising method for scaling information extraction to the level where it can handle the myriad, different relations on the Web.",
        "By using the contents of a database to heuristically label a training corpus, we may be able to automatically learn a nearly unbounded number of relational extractors.",
        "Since the processs of matching database tuples to sentences is inherently heuristic, researchers have proposed multi-instance learning algorithms as a means for coping with the resulting noisy data.",
        "Unfortunately, previous approaches assume that all relations are disjoint – for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple), because two relations are not allowed to have the same arguments.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts.",
        "We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase.",
        "Experiments show improvements for both sentential and aggregate (corpus level) extraction, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally efficient.",
        "Our early progress suggests many interesting directions.",
        "By joining two or more Freebase tables, we can generate many more matches and learn more relations.",
        "We also wish to refine our model in order to improve precision.",
        "For example, we would like to add type reasoning about entities and selectional preference constraints for relations.",
        "Finally, we are also interested in applying the overall learning approaches to other tasks that could be modeled with weak supervision, such as coreference and named entity classification.",
