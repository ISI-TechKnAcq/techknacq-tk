        "American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language with a linguistic structure distinct from English used as a primary means of communication for approximately one half million people in the U.S. (Mitchell et al., 2006).",
        "A majority of deaf 18-year-olds in the U.S. have an English reading level below that of an average 10-year-old hearing student (Holt, 1991), and so software to translate English text into ASL animations can improve many people's access to information, communication, and services.",
        "Previous English-to-ASL machine translation projects (Safar & Marshall, 2001; Zhou et al., 2000) could not generate classifier predicates (CPs), phenomena in which signers use special hand movements to indicate the location and movement of invisible objects in space around them (representing entities under discussion).",
        "Because CPs are frequent in ASL and necessary for conveying many concepts, we have developed a CP generator that can be incorporated into a full English-to-ASL machine translation system.",
        "During a CP, signers use their hands to position, move, trace, or reorient imaginary objects in the space in front of them to indicate the location, movement, shape, contour, physical dimension, or some other property of corresponding real world entities under discussion.",
        "CPs consist of a semantically meaningful handshape and a 3D hand movement path.",
        "A handshape is chosen from a closed set based on characteristics of the entity described (whether it be a vehicle, human, animal, etc.)",
        "and what aspect of the entity the signer is describing (surface, position, motion, etc).",
        "For example, the sentence \"the car parked between the cat and the house\" could be expressed in ASL using 3 CPs.",
        "First, a signer performs the ASL sign HOUSE while raising her eyebrows (to introduce a new entity as a topic).",
        "Then, she moves her hand in a \"Spread C\" handshape (Figure 1) forward to a point in space where a miniature house could be envisioned.",
        "Next, the signer performs the sign CAT with eyebrows raised and makes a similar motion with a \"Hooked V\" handshape to a location where a cat could be imagined.",
        "Finally, she performs the sign CAR (with eyebrows raised) and uses a \"Number 3\" handshape to trace a path that stops at between the 'house' and the 'cat.'",
        "Her other hand makes a flat surface for the 'car' to park on.",
        "(Figure 3 will show our system's animation.)",

        "We have built a prototype ASL generation module that could be incorporated into an English-to-ASL machine translation system.",
        "When given a 3D model of the arrangement of a set of objects whose location and movement should be described in ASL, our system produces an animation of ASL sentences containing classifier predicates to describe the scene.",
        "Classifier predicates are the way such spatial information is typically conveyed in ASL.",
        "Since this is the first ASL generation system to produce classifier predicate sentences (Huener-fauth, 2006b), we have also conducted an evaluation study in which native ASL signers compared our system's animations to the current state of the art: Signed English animations (described later).",
        "To produce classifier predicates and other ASL expressions that associate locations in space around a signer with entities under discussion, an English-to-ASL system must model what objects are being discussed in an English text, and it must map placeholders for these objects to locations in space around the signer's body.",
        "The input to our ASL classifier predicate generator is an explicit 3D model of how a set of placeholders representing discourse entities are positioned in the space around the signing character's body (Huenerfauth, 2006b).",
        "This 3D model is \"mapped\" onto a volume of space in front of the signer's torso, and this model is used to guide the motion of the ASL signer's hands during the performance of classifier predicates describing the motion of these objects",
        "The model encodes the 3D location (center-of-mass) and orientation values of the set of objects that we want to our system describe using ASL animation.",
        "For instance, to generate the \"car parking between the cat and the house\" example, we would pass our system a model with three sets of location (x, y, z coordinates) and orientation (x, y, z, rotation angles) values: for the cat, the car, and the house.",
        "Each 3D placeholder also includes a set of bits that represent the set of possible ASL classifier handshapes that can be used to describe it.",
        "While this 3D model is given as input to our prototype classifier predicate generator, when part of a full generation system, virtual reality \"scene visualization\" software can be used to produce a 3D model of the arrangement and movement of objects discussed in an English input text (Badler et al., 2000; Coyne and Sproat, 2001).",
        "Given the 3D model above, the system uses a planning-based approach to determine how to move the signer's hands, head-tilt, and eye-gaze to produce an animation of a classifier predicate.",
        "The system stores a library of templates representing the various kinds of classifier predicates it may produce.",
        "These templates are planning operators (they have logical pre-conditions, monitored termination conditions, and effects), allowing the system to trigger other elements of ASL signing performance that may be required during a grammatically correct classifier predicate (Huenerfauth, 2006b).",
        "Each planning operator is parameterized on an object in the 3D model (and its 3D coordinates); for instance, there is a templated planning operator for generating an ASL classifier predicate to show a \"parking\" event.",
        "The specific location/orientation of the vehicle that is parking would be the parameter passed to the planning operator.",
        "There is debate in the ASL linguistics community about the underlying structure of classifier predicates and the generation process by which signers produce them.",
        "Our parameterized template approach mirrors one recent linguistic model (Liddell, 2003), and the implementation and evaluation of our prototype generator will help determine whether this was a good choice for our system.",
        "While strings and syntax trees are used to represent written languages inside of NLP software, these encodings are difficult to adapt to a sign language.",
        "ASL lacks a standard writing system, and the multichannel nature of an ASL performance makes it difficult to encode in a linear single-channel string.",
        "This project developed a new formalism for representing a linguistic signal in a multichannel manner and for encoding temporal coordination and non-coordination relationships between portions of the signal (Huenerfauth, 2006a).",
        "The output of our planner is a treelike structure that represents the animation to be synthesized.",
        "The tree has two kinds of non-terminal nodes: some indicate that their children should be performed in sequence (like a traditional linguistic syntax tree), and some non-terminals indicate that their children should be performed in parallel (e.g. one child subtree may specify the movement of the arms, and another, the facial expression).",
        "In this way, the structure can encode how multiple parts of the sign language performance should be coordinated over time while still leaving flexibility to the exact timing of events - see Figure 2.",
        "In earlier work, we have argued that this representation is sufficient for encoding ASL animation (Huenerfauth, 2006a), and the implementation and evaluation of our system (using this formalism) will help test this claim.",

        "Changes in timing of individual animation events causes the structure to stretch in the time dimension (like an HTML table).",
        "After planning, the system has a tree-structure that specifies activities for parts of the signer's body.",
        "Non-terminal nodes indicate whether their children are performed in sequence or in parallel, and the terminal nodes (the inner rectangles in Figure 2) specify animation events for a part of the signer's body.",
        "Nodes' time durations are not yet specified (since the human animation component would know the time that movements require, not the linguistic planner).",
        "So, the generator queries the human animation system to calculate an estimated time duration for each body animation event (each terminal node), and the structure is then 'balanced' so that if several events are meant to occur in parallel, then the shorter events are 'stretched out.'",
        "(The linguistic system can set max/min times for some events prior to the animation processing.)",
        "The facial model is implemented using the Greta facial animation engine (Pasquariello and Pela-chaud, 2001).",
        "Our model controls the motion of the signer's eye-brows, which can be placed in a \"raised\" or \"flat\" position.",
        "The eye motor control repertoire contains three behaviors: fixation on a 3D location in space around the signer's body, smooth pursuit of a moving 3D location, and eye-blinking.",
        "Gaze direction is computed from the location values specified inside the 3D model, and the velocity and time duration of the movement are determined by the timing values inside the tree-structure output from the planner.",
        "The signer's head tilt changes to accommodate horizontal or vertical gaze shifts greater than a set threshold.",
        "When performing a \"fixation\" or \"smooth pursuit\" with the eye-gaze, the rate of eye blinking is decreased.",
        "Whenever the signer's eye-gaze is not otherwise specified for the animation performance, the default behavior is to look at the audience.",
        "Given the tree-structure with animation events, the output of arm-planning should be a list of animation frames that completely specify the rotation angles of the joints of the signer's hands and arms.",
        "The hand is specified using 20 rotation angles for the finger joints, and the arm is specified using 9 rotation angles: 2 for the clavicle joint, 3 for the shoulder joint, 1 for the elbow joint, and 3 for the wrist.",
        "The linguistic planner specifies the hand-shape that should be used for specific classifier predicates; however, the tree-structure specifies the arm movements by giving a target location for the center of the signer's palm and a target orientation value for the palm.",
        "The system must find a set of clavicle, shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles that get the hand to this desired location and palm orientation.",
        "In addition to reaching this target, the arm pose for each animation frame must be as natural as possible, and the animation between frames must be smooth.",
        "The system uses an inverse kinematics (IK) which automatically favors natural arm poses.",
        "Using the wrist as the end-effector, an elbow angle is selected based on the distance from shoulder to the target, and this elbow angle is fixed.",
        "We next compute a set of possible shoulder and wrist rotation angles in order to align the signer's hand with the target palm orientation.",
        "Disregarding elbow angles that force impossible wrist joint angles, we select the arm pose that is collision free and is the most natural, according to a shoulder strength model (Zhao et al., 2005).",

        "This animation specification is performed by an animated human character in the Virtual Human Testbed (Badler et al., 2005).",

        "To make the character appear to be a conversational partner, the \"camera\" inside the virtual environment was set at eye-level with the character and at an appropriate distance for ASL conversation.",

      "text": [
        "There has been little work on developing evaluation methodologies for sign language generation or MT systems.",
        "Some have shown how automatic string-based evaluation metrics fail to identify correct sign language translations (Morrisey and Way, 2006), and they propose building large parallel written/sign corpora containing more syntactic and semantic information (to enable more sophisticated metrics to be created).",
        "Aside from the expense of creating such corpora, we feel that there are several factors that motivate user-based evaluation studies for sign language generation systems - especially for those systems that produce classifier predicates.",
        "These factors include some unique linguistic properties of sign languages and the lack of standard writing systems for most sign languages, like ASL.",
        "Most automatic evaluation approaches for generation or MT systems compare a string produced by a system to a human-produced \"gold-standard\" string.",
        "Sign languages usually lack written forms that are commonly used or known among signers.",
        "While we could invent an artificial ASL writing system for the generator to produce as output (for evaluation purposes only), it's not clear that human ASL signers could accurately or consistently produce written forms of ASL sentences to serve as \"gold standards\" for such an evaluation.",
        "Further, real users of the system would never be shown artificial written ASL; they would see animation output.",
        "Thus, evaluations based on strings would not test the full process - including the synthesis of the \"string\" into an animation - when errors may arise.",
        "Another reason why string-based evaluation metrics are not well-suited to ASL is that sign languages have linguistic properties that can confound string-edit-distance-based metrics.",
        "ASL consists of the coordinated movement of several parts of the body in parallel (i.e. face, eyes, head, hands), and so a string listing the set of signs performed is a lossy representation of the original performance (Huenerfauth, 2006a).",
        "The string may not encode the non-manual parts of the sentence, and so string-based metrics would fail to consider those important aspects.",
        "Discourse factors (e.g. topicali-zation) can also result in movement phenomena in ASL that may scramble the sequence of signs in the sentence without substantially changing its semantics; such movement would affect string-based metrics significantly though the sentence meaning may change little.",
        "The use of head-tilt and eye-gaze during the performance of ASL verb signs may also license the dropping of entire sentence constituents (Neidle et.",
        "al, 2000).",
        "The entities discussed are associated with locations in space around the signer at which head-tilt or eye-gaze is aimed, and thus the constituent is actually still expressed although no manual signs are performed for it.",
        "Thus, an automatic metric may penalize such a sentence (for missing a constituent) while the information is still there.",
        "Finally, ASL classifier predicates convey a lot of information in a single complex 'sign' (handshape indicates semantic category, movement shows 3D path/rotation), and it is unclear how we could \"write\" the 3D data of a classifier predicate in a string-based encoding or how to calculate an edit-distance between a 'gold standard' classifier predicate and a generated one."

        "For example, in the sentence \"the car parked between the cat and the house,\" one subject felt it would be better to use the non-dominant hand to hold the location of the house during the car's movement instead of using the non-dominant hand to create a platform for the dominant hand (the car) to park upon."

        "Unlike an evaluation of a broad-coverage NLP system, during which we obtain performance statistics for the system as it carries out a linguistic task on a large corpus or \"test set,\" this paper has described an evaluation of a prototype system.",
        "We were not measuring the linguistic coverage of the system but rather its functionality.",
        "Did signers agree that the animation output: (1) is actually a grammatically-correct and understandable classifier predicate and (2) conveys the information about the movement of objects in the 3D scene being described?",
        "We expected to find animation details that could be improved in future work; however, since there are currently no other systems capable of generating ASL classifier predicate animations, any system receiving an answer of \"yes\" to questions (1) and (2) above is an improvement to the state of the art.",

        "Another contribution of this initial evaluation is that it serves as a pilot study to help us determine how to better evaluate sign language generation systems in the future.",
        "We found that subjects were comfortable critiquing ASL animations, and most suggested specific (and often subtle) elements of the animation to be improved.",
        "Their feedback suggested new modifications we can make to the system (and then evaluate again in future studies).",
        "Because subjects gave such high quality feedback, future studies will also elicit such comments.",
        "During the study, we also experimented with recording a native ASL signer (using a motion-capture suit and datagloves) performing classifier predicates.",
        "We tried to use this motion-capture data to animate a virtual human character superficially identical to the one used by our system.",
        "We hoped that this character controlled by human movements could serve as an upper-baseline in the evaluation study.",
        "Unfortunately, the motion-capture data we collected contained minor errors that required postprocessing clean-up, and the resulting animations contained enough movement inaccuracies that native ASL signers who viewed them felt they were actually less understandable than our system's animations.",
        "In future work, we intend to explore alternative upper-baselines to compare our system's animations to: animation from alternative motion-capture techniques, hand-coded animations based on a human's performance, or simply a video of a human signer performing ASL sentences."
