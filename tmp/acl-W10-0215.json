        "The user interface enables animators to further refine the animations.",
        "Here, we focus on the emotion extraction component of NewsViz which facilitates subtle background visualization.",
        "NewsViz detects moods from news reports.",
        "The original text is part-of-speech tagged and adjectives and/or nouns, the word types conveying most emotional meaning, are filtered out and labeled with an emotion and intensity value.",
        "Subsequently reoccurring emotions are joined into longer lasting moods and matched with appropriate animation presets.",
        "Different linguistic analysis methods were tested on NewsViz: word-by-word, sentence-based and minimum threshold summarization, to find a minimum number of occurrences of an emotion in forming a valid mood.",
        "NewsViz proved to be viable for the fixed domain of football news, grasping the overall moods and some more detailed emotions precisely.",
        "NewsViz offers an efficient technique to cater for the production of a large number of daily updated news stories.",

        "Further development may refine the detection of emotion shifts through summarization with the full implementation of football and common linguistic knowledge.",
        "News reports are regarded as objective facts, commonly delivered in an objective, unbiased manner and represented in a neutral and formal format: typically a static headline, a summarizing paragraph with one image and eventually the body text with one to three more images.",
        "Even though reporters find the content of news stories worth mentioning for emotional reasons and the content often affects readers emotionally, story brevity, scarce background information and poor combination of visual and verbal information hinders learning and feeling by viewers.",
        "In order to reach the audience emotionally, to educate and to entertain, emphasis on visual elements is important as they tend to be more memorable than verbal ones.",
        "The emphasis of NewsViz lies on expression, impacting on the reader's understanding of the article and making it more memorable.",
        "The software prototype, NewsViz, automatically creates animations from news articles.",
        "Abstract design elements show emotions conveyed in the stories.",
        "The main objective of NewViz remains information provision and thus our focus is emotion extraction which is universally applicable and without opinion bias.",

        "Multimodal systems automatically mapping text to visuals face challenges in interpreting human language which is variable, ambiguous, imprecise and relies on the communicative partners possessing common knowledge.",
        "Enabling a machine to understand a natural language text involves feeding the machine with grammatical structures, e.g. part-of-speech, semantic relations, e.g. emotion value and intensity, and visual descriptions, e.g. colors and motion direction, to match suitable graphics."

        "NewsViz takes online news articles as input and outputs animations reflecting the content of these news stories.",

        "The three different emotion extraction methods, word-by-word, sentence-based and threshold were run on these news stories with varying word types or word type combinations.",

        "Falsely detected emotions are rated with zero points.",
        "Missing emotions were assessed depending on their significance in the text.",
        "If the overall feeling of the match was represented, two to three points would be given, but if the main emotions were missing, no points were assigned.",
        "Very close, but not exact emotions, got a value of four.",
        "A correct representation of the course of emotion received five points.",
        "The grain counts the number of the extracted emotions per text.",
        "The results for correctness of emotional findings and amount of emotions detected (grain) of each method run on each part-of-speech or word type combination are presented in Figure 6.",
        "The results analysis shows that the effectiveness of adjectives or nouns varies from text to text, but generally the best results are achieved with the extraction of both kinds of words.",
        "On average the word-by-word method produces emotion sequences with the closest correctness, but unfortunately its output is too fine grained for visualization.",
        "Thirty second long animations are best visualized with two to ten mood swings.",
        "This means that some form of summarization is needed.",
        "Combining emotions of logically structured chunks of text, namely sentences, in the sentence-based summarization method achieved better results than the minimum subsequent occurrence of two or three emotions with the threshold method.",
        "The sentence-based sum-marizaion as well as the threshold method with a minimum value of 3 produce the most appropriate grain/number of emotions.",
        "Some misinterpretation is due to false part-of-speech tagging by Qtag which has particular trouble with proper nouns.",
        "More accuracy can be achieved through training Qtag on football reports.",
        "Overall the results for NewsViz are satisfactory and it demonstrates that it is possible to extract emotions from news texts.",
        "The generally different sensations of the two described football matches are distinguishable.",
