        "The two tasks are called temporal extraction and temporal normalization, respectively.",
        "We have implemented a full system CTEMP, which consists of two modules: extractor and normalizer.",
        "The two modules fulfill temporal extraction and temporal normalization, respectively.",
        "A comprehensive temporal framework is investigated to analyze the elements involved in the mapping procedure, from surface text to internal temporal information.",
        "This framework includes basic temporal objects and relations, the measurement of time, and the classification of temporal expressions from Chinese texts.",
        "To cope with the flexibilities of the temporal expressions, we have built the temporal parser based on chart-parsing and effective constraints.",
        "Experiments with respect to a substantial corpus show that the temporal parser achieves promising results.",
        "We took part in TERN 2004 Chinese temporal expression extraction with this temporal parser and our performance is the highest in that track.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give a brief discussion on related works; Section 3 describes the temporal framework, which is the basis of the whole temporal parser; extractor and normalizer of the temporal parser are discussed in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively; Section 6 gives the description about experiments and evaluations.",
