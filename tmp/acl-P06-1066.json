        "Phrase reordering is of great importance for phrase-based SMT systems and becoming an active area of research recently.",
        "Compared with word-based SMT systems, phrase-based systems can easily address reorderings of words within phrases.",
        "However, at the phrase level, reordering is still a computationally expensive problem just like reordering at the word level (Knight, 1999).",
        "Many systems use very simple models to reorder phrases 1.",
        "One is distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) which penalizes translations according to their jump distance instead of their content.",
        "For example, if N words are skipped, a penalty of N will be paid regardless of which words are reordered.",
        "This model takes the risk of penalizing long distance jumps",
        "which are common between two languages with very different orders.",
        "Another simple model is flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2005) which is not content dependent either.",
        "Flat model assigns constant probabilities for monotone order and non-monotone order.",
        "The two probabilities can be set to prefer monotone or non-monotone orientations depending on the language pairs.",
        "In view of content-independency of the distortion and flat reordering models, several researchers (Och et al., 2004; Tillmann, 2004; Kumar et al., 2005; Koehn et al., 2005) proposed a more powerful model called lexicalized reordering model that is phrase dependent.",
        "Lexicalized reordering model learns local orientations (monotone or non-monotone) with probabilities for each bilingual phrase from training data.",
        "During decoding, the model attempts to finding a Viterbi local orientation sequence.",
        "Performance gains have been reported for systems with lexicalized reordering model.",
        "However, since reorderings are related to concrete phrases, researchers have to design their systems carefully in order not to cause other problems, e.g. the data sparseness problem.",
        "Another smart reordering model was proposed by Chiang (2005).",
        "In his approach, phrases are reorganized into hierarchical ones by reducing sub-phrases to variables.",
        "This template-based scheme not only captures the reorderings of phrases, but also integrates some phrasal generalizations into the global model.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel solution for phrasal reordering.",
        "Here, under the ITG constraint (Wu, 1997; Zens et al., 2004), we need to consider just two kinds of reorderings, straight and inverted between two consecutive blocks.",
        "Therefore reordering can be modelled as a problem of",
        "classification with only two labels, straight and inverted.",
        "In this paper, we build a maximum entropy based classification model as the reordering model.",
        "Different from lexicalized reordering, we do not use the whole block as reordering evidence, but only features extracted from blocks.",
        "This is more flexible.",
        "It makes our model reorder any blocks, observed in training or not.",
        "The whole maximum entropy based reordering model is embedded inside a log-linear phrase-based model of translation.",
        "Following the Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG) (Wu, 1996), we built a CKY-style decoder for our system, which makes it possible to reorder phrases hierarchically.",
        "To create a maximum entropy based reordering model, the first step is learning reordering examples from training data, similar to the lexicalized reordering model.",
        "But in our way, any evidences of reorderings will be extracted, not limited to reorderings of bilingual phrases of length less than a predefined number of words.",
        "Secondly, features will be extracted from reordering examples according to feature templates.",
        "Finally, a maximum entropy classifier will be trained on the features.",
        "In this paper we describe our system and the MaxEnt-based reordering model with the associated algorithm.",
        "We also present experiments that indicate that the MaxEnt-based reordering model improves translation significantly compared with other reordering approaches and a state-of-the-art distortion-based system (Koehn, 2004)."

        "Under the BTG scheme, translation is more like monolingual parsing through derivations.",
        "Throughout the translation procedure, three rules are used to derive the translation",
        "During decoding, the source sentence is segmented into a sequence of phrases as in a standard phrase-based model.",
        "Then the lexical rule (3) 2 is 2Currently, we restrict phrases x and y not to be null.",
        "Therefore neither deletion nor insertion is carried out during decoding.",
        "However, these operations are to be considered in our future version of model.",
        "used to translate source phrase y into target phrase x and generate a block A.",
        "Later, the straight rule (1) merges two consecutive blocks into a single larger block in the straight order; while the inverted rule (2) merges them in the inverted order.",
        "These two merging rules will be used continuously until the whole source sentence is covered.",
        "When the translation is finished, a tree indicating the hierarchical segmentation of the source sentence is also produced.",
        "In the following, we will define the model in a straight way, not in the dynamic programming recursion way used by (Wu, 1996; Zens et al., 2004).",
        "We focus on defining the probabilities of different rules by separating different features (including the language model) out from the rule probabilities and organizing them in a log-linear form.",
        "This straight way makes it clear how rules are used and what they depend on.",
        "For the two merging rules straight and inverted, applying them on two consecutive blocks Ai and A2 is assigned a probability Pr' (A)",
        "where the Q is the reordering score of block Ai and A2, an is its weight, and APLM(Al A2) is the increment of the language model score of the two blocks according to their final order, ALM is its weight.",

        "are the lexical translation probabilities in both directions, and exp(1) and exp(I xI) are the phrase penalty and word penalty, respectively.",
        "These features are very common in state-of-the-art systems (Koehn et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005) and As are weights of features.",
        "For the reordering model Q, we define it on the two consecutive blocks Ai and A2 and their order",
        "Under this framework, different reordering models can be designed.",
        "In fact, we defined four reordering models in our experiments.",
        "The first one",
        "is NONE, meaning no explicit reordering features at all.",
        "We set Q to 1 for all different pairs of blocks and their orders.",
        "So the phrasal reordering is totally dependent on the language model.",
        "This model is obviously different from the monotone search, which does not use the inverted rule at all.",
        "The second one is a distortion style reordering model, which is formulated as",
        "where JAZj denotes the number of words on the source side of blocks.",
        "When an < 0, this design will penalize those non-monotone translations.",

        "It is formulated as",
        "In our experiments on Chinese-English tasks, the probability for the straight order is set at pm = 0.95.",
        "This is because word order in Chinese and English is usually similar.",
        "The last one is the maximum entropy based reordering model proposed by us, which will be described in the next section.",
        "We define a derivation D as a sequence of applications of rules (1) – (3), and let c(D) and e(D) be the Chinese and English yields of D. The probability of a derivation D is",

        "Our algorithm guarantees that any sub-cells within (i, j) have been expanded before cell (i, j) is expanded.",
        "Therefore the way to generate derivations in cell (i, j) is to merge derivations from any two neighbor sub-cells.",

        "Pruning of the search space is very important for the decoder.",
        "We use three pruning ways.",
        "The first one is recombination.",
        "When two derivations in the same cell have the same w leftmost/rightmost words on the English yields, where w depends on the order of the language model, they will be recombined by discarding the derivation with lower score.",
        "The second one is the threshold pruning which discards derivations that have a score worse than a times the best score in the same cell.",
        "The last one is the histogram pruning which only keeps the top n best derivations for each cell.",
        "In all our experiments, we set n = 40, a = 0.5 to get a tradeoff between speed and performance in the development set.",
        "Another feature of our decoder is the k-best list generation.",
        "The k-best list is very important for the minimum error rate training (Och, 2003a) which is used for tuning the weights A for our model.",
        "We use a very lazy algorithm for the k-best list generation, which runs two phases similarly to the one by Huang et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "In the first phase, the decoder runs as usual except that it keeps some information of weaker derivations which are to be discarded during recombination.",
        "This will generate not only the first-best of final derivation but also a shared forest.",
        "In the second phase, the lazy algorithm runs recursively on the shared forest.",
        "It finds the second-best of the final derivation, which makes its children to find their second-best, and children’s children’s second-best, until the leaf node’s second-best.",
        "Then it finds the third-best, forth-best, and so on.",

        "In the experiments described above, collocation features do not make great contributions to the performance improvement but make the total number of features increase greatly.",
        "This is a problem for MaxEnt parameter estimation if it is scaled to large bitexts.",
        "Therefore, for the integration of MaxEnt-based phrase reordering model in the system trained on large bitexts, we remove collocation features and only use lexical features from the last words of blocks (similar to those from the first words of blocks with similar performance).",
        "This time the bilingual training data contain 2.4M sentence pairs (68.1M Chinese words and 73.8M English words) and two trigram language models are used.",
        "One is trained on the English side of the bilingual training data.",
        "The other is trained on the Xinhua portion of the Gigaword corpus with 181.1M words.",
        "We also use some rules to translate numbers, time expressions and Chinese person names.",

        "bor blocks.",
        "Experiments on standard Chinese-English translation tasks from two different domains showed that our method achieves a significant improvement over the distortion/flat reordering models.",
        "Traditional distortion/flat-based SMT translation systems are good for learning phrase translation pairs, but learn nothing for phrasal reorderings from real-world data.",
        "This is our original motivation for designing a new reordering model, which can learn reorderings from training data just like learning phrasal translations.",
        "Lexicalized reordering model learns reorderings from training data, but it binds reorderings to individual concrete phrases, which restricts the model to reorderings of phrases seen in training data.",
        "On the contrary, the MaxEnt-based reordering model is not limited by this constraint since it is based on features of phrase, not phrase itself.",
        "It can be easily generalized to reorder unseen phrases provided that some features are fired on these phrases.",
        "Another advantage of the MaxEnt-based reordering model is that it can take more features into reordering, even though they are nonindependent.",
        "Tillmann et.",
        "al (2005) also use a MaxEnt model to integrate various features.",
        "The difference is that they use the MaxEnt model to predict not only orders but also blocks.",
        "To do that, it is necessary for the MaxEnt model to incorporate real-valued features such as the block translation probability and the language model probability.",
        "Due to the expensive computation, a local model is built.",
        "However, our MaxEnt model is just a module of the whole log-linear model of translation which uses its score as a real-valued feature.",
        "The modularity afforded by this design does not incur any computation problems, and make it eas",
        "ier to update one sub-model with other modules unchanged.",
        "Beyond the MaxEnt-based reordering model, another feature deserving attention in our system is the CKY style decoder which observes the ITG.",
        "This is different from the work of Zens et.",
        "al.",
        "(2004).",
        "In their approach, translation is generated linearly, word by word and phrase by phrase in a traditional way with respect to the incorporation of the language model.",
        "It can be said that their decoder did not violate the ITG constraints but not that it observed the ITG.",
        "The ITG not only decreases reorderings greatly but also makes reordering hierarchical.",
        "Hierarchical reordering is more meaningful for languages which are organized hierarchically.",
        "From this point, our decoder is similar to the work by Chiang (2005).",
        "The future work is to investigate other valuable features, e.g. binary features that explain blocks from the syntactical view.",
        "We think that there is still room for improvement if more contributing features are used."
