        "In this paper, we mainly deal with information extraction from text fragments that closely resemble structured records.",
        "Examples of such texts include citation strings in research papers, contact addresses on person homepages and apartment listings in classified ads.",
        "Pattern matching and rule-based approaches for IE (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005) that only use specific patterns, and delimiter and Andrew McCallum font-based cues for segmentation are prone to failure on such data because these cues are generally not broadly reliable.",
        "Statistical machine learning methods such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989; Seymore et al., 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 1999) and conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Sarawagi and Cohen, 2005) have become popular approaches to address the text extraction problem.",
        "However, these methods require labeled training data, such as annotated text, which is often scarce and expensive to produce.",
        "In many cases, however, there already exists a database with schema related to the desired output, and records that are imperfectly rendered in the available unlabeled text.",
        "This database can serve as a source of significant supervised guidance to machine learning methods.",
        "Previous work on using databases to train information extractors has taken one of three simpler approaches.",
        "In the first, a separate language model is trained on each column of the database and these models are then used to segment and label a given text sequence (Agichtein and Ganti, 2004; Can-isius and Sporleder, 2007).",
        "However, this approach does not model context, errors or different formats of fields in text, and requires large number of database entries to learn an accurate language model.",
        "The second approach (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004; Michelson and Knoblock, 2005; Mansuri and Sarawagi, 2006) uses database or dictionary lookups in combination with similarity measures to add features to the text sequence.",
        "Although these features are very informative, learning algorithms still require annotated data to make use of them.",

        "This induced labeling is then used to train a text extractor.",

        "First, we are able to model field ordering and context around fields by learning an extractor from annotations of the text itself.",
        "Second, a probabilistic model for word alignment can exploit dependencies among alignments, and is also robust to errors, formatting differences, and missing fields in text and the record.",
        "Our word alignment model is a conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) that generates alignments between tokens of a text sequence and a matching database record.",
        "The structure of the graphical model resembles IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) in which each target (record) word is assigned one or more source (text) words.",
        "The alignment is generated conditioned on both the record and text sequence, and therefore supports large sets of rich and non-independent features of the sequence pairs.",
        "Our model is trained without the need for labeled word alignments by using generalized expectation (GE) criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2008) that penalize the divergence of specific model expectations from target expectations.",
        "Model parameters are estimated by minimizing this divergence.",
        "To limit over-fitting we include a L2-regularization term in the objective.",
        "The model expectations in GE criteria are taken with respect to a set of alignment latent variables that are either specific to each sequence pair (local) or summarizing the entire data set (global).",
        "This set is constructed by including all alignment variables a that satisfy a certain binary feature (e.g., /(a, xi,yi, X2) = 1, for labeled record (xi, yi), and text sequence X2).",
        "One example global criterion is that \"an alignment exists between two orthographically similar words 95% of the time.\"",
        "Here the criterion has a target expectation of 95% and is defined over alignments {a = I xi[i] ~ X2L7], Vxi, X2}.",

        "This criterion has a target of 100% and defined for {a = I yi[i] = booktitle A ^[j] = 'EMNLP', Vyi, X2}.",
        "One-to-one correspondence between words in the sequence pair can be specified as collection of local expectation constraints.",
        "Since we directly encode prior knowledge of how alignments behave in our criteria, we obtain sufficiently accurate alignments with little supervision.",
        "We apply our method to the task of citation extraction.",
        "The input to our training algorithm is a set of matching DBLP-record/citation-text pairs and global GE criteria of the following two types: (1) alignment criteria that consider features of mapping between record and text words, and, (2) extraction criteria that consider features of the schema label assigned to a text word.",
        "In our experiments, the parallel record-text pairs are collected manually but this process can be automated using systems that match text sequences to records in the DB (Michelson and Knoblock, 2005; Michelson and Knoblock, 2008).",
        "Such systems achieve very high accuracy close to 90% Fl on semi-structured domains similar to ours.",
        "Our trained alignment model can be used to directly align new record-text pairs to create a labeling of the texts.",
        "Empirical results demonstrate a 20.6% error reduction in token labeling accuracy compared to a strong baseline method that employs a set of high-precision alignments.",
        "Furthermore, we provide a 63.8% error reduction compared to IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Alignments learned by our model are used to train a linear-chain CRF extractor.",
