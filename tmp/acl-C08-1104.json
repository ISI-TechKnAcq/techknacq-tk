        "In recent years, subjectivity analysis and opinion mining have attracted considerable attention in the NLP community.",
        "Unlike traditional information extraction and document classification tasks which usually focus on extracting facts or categorizing documents into topics (e.g., \"sports\", \"politics\", \"medicine\"), subjectivity analysis focuses on determining whether a language unit (such as a word, sentence or document) expresses a private state, opinion or attitude and, if so, what polarity is expressed, i.e. a positive or negative attitude.",
        "Inspired by Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) and Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006), we explore the automatic detection of the subjectivity of word senses, in contrast to the more frequently explored task of determining the subjectivity of words (see Section 2).",
        "This is motivated by many words being subjectivity-ambiguous, i.e. having both subjective and objective senses, such as the word positive with its two example senses given below.",
        "(1) positive, electropositive – having a positive electric charge;\"protons are positive\" (objective)",
        "(2) plus, positive – involving advantage or good; \"a plus (or positive) factor\" (subjective)",
        "Subjectivity labels for senses add an additional layer of annotation to electronic lexica and allow to group many fine-grained senses into higher-level classes based on subjectivity/objectivity.",
        "This can increase the lexica's usability.",
        "As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity-ambiguous words (such as positive).",
        "In addition, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) show that the performance of automatic annotation of subjectivity at the word level can be hurt by the presence of subjectivity-ambiguous words in the training sets they use.",
        "Moreover, the prevalence of different word senses in different domains also means that a subjective or an objective sense of a word might be dominant in different domains; thus, in a science text positive is likely not to have a subjective reading.",
        "The annotation of words as subjective and objective or positive and negative independent of sense or domain does not capture such distinctions.",
        "In this paper, we validate whether word sense subjectivity labeling can be achieved with existing resources for subjectivity analysis at the word and sentence level without creating a dedicated, manually annotated training set of WordNet senses labeled for subjectivity?",
        "We show that such an approach – even using a simple rule-based unsupervised algorithm – can compete with a standard supervised approach and also compares well to prior research on word sense subjectivity labeling.",
        "However, success depends to a large degree on the definition of subjectivity used in the establishment of the prior resources.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous work.",
        "Section 3 introduces our human annotation scheme for word sense subjectivity and also shows that subjectivity-ambiguous words are frequent.",
        "Section 4 describes our proposed classification algorithms in detail.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental results and evaluation, followed by conclusions and future work in Section 6."

        "There has been extensive research in opinion mining at the document level, for example on product and movie reviews (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Dave et al., 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).",
        "Several other approaches focus on the subjectivity classification of sentences (Kim and Hovy, 2005; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "They often build on the presence of subjective words in the sentence to be classified.",
        "Closer to our work is the large body of work on the automatic, context-independent classification of words according to their polarity, i.e as positive or negative (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).",
        "They use either co-occurrence patterns in corpora or dictionary-based methods.",
        "Many papers assume that subjectivity recognition, i.e. separating subjective from objective words, has already been achieved prior to polarity recognition and test against word lists containing subjective words only (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Takamura et al., 2005).",
        "However, Kim and Hovy (2004) and An-dreevskaia and Bergler (2006) also address the classification into subjective/objective words and show this to be a potentially harder task than polarity classification with lower human agreement and automatic performance.",
        "There are only two prior approaches addressing word sense subjectivity or polarity classification.",
        "Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) determine the polarity of word senses in WordNet, distinguishing among positive, negative and objective.",
        "They expand a small, manually determined seed set of strongly positive/negative WordNet senses by following WordNet relations and use the resulting larger training set for supervised classification.",
        "The resulting labeled WordNet gives three scores for each sense, representing the positive, negative and objective score respectively.",
        "However, there is no evaluation as to the accuracy of their approach.",
        "They then extend their work (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007) by applying the Page Rank algorithm to ranking the WordNet senses in terms of how strongly a sense possesses a given semantic property (e.g., positive or negative).",
        "Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective.",
        "They use a method relying on distributional similarity as well as an independent, large manually annotated opinion corpus (MPQA) (Wiebe et al., 2005) for determining subjectivity.",
        "One of the disadvantages of their algorithm is that it is restricted to senses that have distributionally similar words in the MPQA corpus, excluding 23.2% of their test data from automatic classification."

      "text": [
        "In contrast to other researchers (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Takamura et al., 2005), we do not see polarity as a category that is dependent on prior subjectivity assignment and therefore applicable to subjective senses only.",
        "We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states \"that are not open to objective observation or verification\".",
        "This includes direct references to emotions, beliefs and judgements (such as anger, criticise) as well as expressions that let a private state be inferred, for example by referring to a doctor as a quack.",
        "In contrast, polarity refers to positive or negative associations of a word or sense.",
        "Whereas there is a dependency in that most subjective senses have a relatively clear polarity, polarity can be attached to objective words/senses as well.",
        "For example, tuberculosis is not subjective – it does not describe a private state, is objectively verifiable and would not cause a sentence containing it to carry an opinion, but it does carry negative associations for the vast majority of people.",
        "We therefore annotate subjectivity of word senses similarly to Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006), distinguishing between subjective (S), objective (O) or both (B).",
        "Both is used if a literal and metaphoric sense of a word are collapsed into one WordNet synset or if a WordNet synset contains both opinionated and objective expressions (such as bastard and illegitimate child in Ex.",
        "3 below).",
        "We expand their annotation scheme by also annotating polarity, using the labels positive (P), negative (AO and varied (V).",
        "The latter is used when a sense's polarity varies strongly with the context, such as Example 8 below, where we would expect uncompromising to be a judgement but this judgement will be positive or negative depending on what a person is uncompromising about.",
        "To avoid prevalence of personalised associations, annotators were told to only annotate polarity for subjective senses, as well as objective senses that carry a strong association likely to be shared by most people at least in Western culture (such as the negative polarity for words referring to diseases and crime).",
        "Other objective senses would receive the label 0:NoPol.",
        "Therefore, we have 7 sub categories in total: 0:NoPol, 0:P, 0:N, S:P, S:N, S:V, and B.",
        "The notation before and after the colon represents the subjectivity and polarity label respectively.",
        "We list some annotated examples below.",
        "(3) bastard, by-blow, love child, illegitimate child, illegitimate, whoreson – the illegitimate offspring of unmarried parents (B)",
        "(4) atrophy – undergo atrophy; \"Muscles that are not used will atrophy\" (0:N)",
        "(5) guard, safety, safety device – a device designed to prevent injury (0:P)",
        "(6) nasty, awful – offensive or even (of persons) mali-cious;\"in a nasty mood\";\"a nasty accident\"; \"a nasty shock\" (S:N)",
        "(7) happy – enjoying or showing or marked by joy or pleasure or good fortune; \"a happy smile\";\"spent many happy days on the beach\"; \"a happy marriage\" (S:P)",
        "(8) uncompromising, inflexible – not making concessions; \"took an uncompromising stance in the peace talks\" (S:V)",
        "As far as we are aware, this is the first annotation scheme for both subjectivity and polarity of word senses.",
        "We believe both are relevant for opinion extraction: subjectivity for finding and analysing directly expressed opinions, and polarity for either classifying these further or extracting objective words that, however, serve to \"colour\" a text or present bias rather than explicitly stated opinions.",
        "Su and Markert (2008) describe the annotation scheme and agreement study in full.",
        "We used the Micro-WNOp corpus containing 1105 WordNet synsets to test our annotation scheme.The Micro-WNOp corpus is representative of the part-of-speech distribution in WordNet.",
        "Two annotators (both near-native English speakers) independently annotated 606 synsets of the Micro-WNOp corpus for subjectivity and polarity.",
        "One annotator is the second author of this paper whereas the other is not a linguist.",
        "The overall agreement using all 7 categories is 84.6%, with a kappa of 0.77, showing high reliability for a difficult pragmatic task.",
        "This at first seems at odds with the notion of sentiment as a fuzzy category as expressed in (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006) but we believe is due to three factors:",
        "• The annotation of senses instead of words splits most subjectivity-ambiguous words into several senses, removing one source of annotation difficulty.",
        "• The annotation of senses in a dictionary provided the annotators with sense descriptions in form of Wordnet glosses as well as related senses, providing more information than a pure word annotation task.",
        "• The split of subjectivity and polarity annotation made the task clearer and the annotation of only very strong connotations for objective word senses \"de-individualized\" the task.",
        "As in this paper we are only interested in subjectivity recognition, we collapse S:V, S:P, and S:N into a single label S and 0:NoPol, O.P, and 0:N into a single label O. Label B remains unchanged.",
        "For this three-way annotation overall percentage agreement is 90.1%, with a kappa of 0.79.",
        "After cases with disagreement were negotiated between the two annotators, a gold standard annotation was agreed upon.",
        "Our test set consists of this agreed set as well as the remainder of the Micro-WNOp corpus annotated by one of the annotators alone after agreement was established.",

        "As it is costly to create such training sets, we investigate whether existing resources such as two different subjective sentence lists (Section 4.2) and two different subjective word lists (Section 4.3) can be adapted to provide training data or clue sets although they do not provide any information about word senses.",

        "Therefore, for the rule-based unsupervised algorithm we lemmatized and POS-tagged the glosses in the Micro-WNOp test set.",

        "For example, amelioration is seen as non-polar in GI but improvement is annotated with positive polarity.",

        "), and objective otherwise.",

        "It is also true that the sentences (plot descriptions) in its \"objective\" data set relatively rarely contain opinions about the movie.",

        "If the sum of positive and negative scores of a sense in SentiWordNet is more than or equal to 0.5, then it is subjective and otherwise objective.",
        "Using this mapping, it achieves an accuracy of 75.3% on the Micro-WNOp corpus, compared to our gold standard.",
        "Therefore our methods CV* and SL* perform slightly better than theirs, although the improvement is not significant.",
        "The task definition in Wiebe and Mihal-cea (2006) is much more similar to ours but they use different annotated test data, which is not publically available, so an exact comparison is not possible.",
        "Both data sets, however, seem to include relatively frequent words.",
        "One disadvantage of their method is that it is not applicable to all WordNet senses as it is dependent on distributionally similar words being available in the MPQA.",
        "Thus, 23% of their test data is excluded from evaluation, whereas our methods can be used on any WordNet sense.",
        "They measure precision and recall for subjective senses in a precision/recall curve: Precision is about 48/9% at a recall of 60% for subjective senses whereas our best SL* method has a precision of 66% at about the same recall.",
        "Although this suggests better performance of our method, it is not possible to draw final conclusions from this comparison due to the data set differences.",

        "We proposed different ways of extracting training data and clue sets for word sense subjectivity labeling from existing opinion mining resources.",
        "The effectiveness of the resulting algorithms depends greatly on the generated training data, more specifically on the different definitions of subjectivity used in resource creation.",
        "However, we were able to show that at least one of these methods (based on the SL word list) resulted in a classifier that performed on a par with a supervised classifier that used dedicated training data developed for this task (CV).",
        "Thus, it is possible to avoid any manual annotation for the subjectivity classification of word senses.",
        "Our future work will explore new methodologies in feature representation by importing more background information (e.g., syntactic information).",
        "Furthermore, our current method of integrating the rich relation information in WordNet (using them as standard features) does not use joint classification of several senses.",
        "Instead, we think it will be more promising to use the relations to construct graphs for semi-supervised graph-based learning of word sense subjectivity.",
        "In addition, we will also explore whether the derived sense labels improve applications such as sentence classification and clustering WordNet senses."
