        "We explore the differences in verb subcategorization frequencies across several corpora in an effort to obtain stable cross corpus subcategorization probabilities for use in norming psychological experiments.",
        "For the 64 single sense verbs we looked at, subcategorization preferences were remarkably stable between British and American corpora, and between balanced corpora and financial news corpora.",
        "Of the verbs that did show differences, these differences were generally found between the balanced corpora and the financial news data.",
        "We show that all or nearly all of these shifts in subcategorization are realised via (often subtle) word sense differences.",
        "This is an interesting observation in itself, and also suggests that stable cross corpus subcategorization frequencies may be found when verb sense is adequately controlled."

        "(1998) have shown that that word frequency, word sense (as defined by collocates), the distribution of synonymous words and the use of syntactic structures varies with corpus genre.",
        "Roland & Jurafsky (1998, 2000 in press) showed that there were subcategorization frequency differences between various written and spoken corpora, and furthermore showed that that these subcategorization frequency differences are caused by variation in word sense as well as genre and discourse type differences among the corpora.",
        "While the subcategorization probabilities in a computational language model can be adjusted to match a particular corpus, cross corpus differences in such probabilities pose an important problem when using corpora for norming psychological experiments.",
        "If each corpus generates a separate set of probabilities, which probabilities are the correct ones to use as a model of human language processing?",
        "In an attempt to use corpora to provide norming data for 64 verbs for experimental purposes, we investigate in detail how verb frequencies and verb subcategorization frequencies differ among three corpora: the British National Corpus",
        "(BNC), the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ), and the Brown Corpus (Brown).",
        "For the 64 verbs, we randomly selected a set of sentences from each corpus and hand-coded them for transitivity, passive versus active voice, and whether the selected usage was an instance of the most common sense of the verb.",
        "We then ask two questions: Do these verbs have the same subcategorization probabilities across corpora, and, when there are differences, what is the cause.",
        "If a set of factors causing the differences can be identified and controlled for, then a stable set of cross-corpus probabilities suitable for norming psychological experiments can be generated.",
        "While previous work has shown that differences between corpora do exist, and that word sense differences play a large role in realising these differences, much less is known about the effect of other factors on subcategorization variation across corpora.",
        "For example, are there gross subcategorization differences between British and American English?",
        "To what extent does the business-genre nature of the Wall Street Journal corpus affect subcategorization probabilities?",
        "Finally, while Roland and Jurafsky (2000 in press) suggested that sense differences played a major role in subcategorization biases, they were only able to test their hypothesis on a small number of verbs.",
        "Our eventual goal is an understanding of many levels of verb differences across corpora, including verb frequency, frequency of transitive versus intransitive uses, frequency of other subcategorization frames, and frequency of active versus passive use.",
        "This paper reports our preliminary results on the first two of these issues.",
        "Verb usage was surprisingly unaffected by differences between British and American English.",
        "Those differences that did occur seem mostly to be caused by differences in the distribution of verb senses across corpora.",
        "The business-genre nature of the Wall Street Journal corpus caused certain verbs to appear more often in particular senses that had a strong effect on its subcategorization frequencies.",
        "Even after controlling for the broad sense of the verb, we found subcategorization differences caused by the \"micro-differences\" in sense, including quite specific arguments to the verb."

        "This was partly for logistic reasons, since such fine-grained senses are very hard to code, and partially because we suspected that very narrowly defined senses frequently have only one possible subcategorization.",

        "The second result is that for the 9 out of 64 verbs that did change in transitivity bias, the shift in transitivity bias was largely a result of subtle shifts in verb sense between the genres present in each corpus.",
        "These two results suggest that when verb sense is adequately controlled for, verbs have stable subcategorization probabilities across corpora.",
