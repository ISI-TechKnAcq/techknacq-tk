        "Paraphrasing, the task of finding sets of semantically equivalent surface forms, is crucial to many natural language processing applications, including relation extraction (Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008), question answering (Fader et al., 2013), summa-rization (Barzilay et al., 1999) and machine translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "While the benefits of paraphrasing have been demonstrated, creating a large-scale corpus of high precision paraphrases remains a challenge ?",
        "especially for event relations.",
        "Many researchers have considered generating paraphrases by mining the Web guided by the distributional hypothesis, which states that words occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954).",
        "For example, DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and Resolver (Yates and Etzioni, 2009) identify synonymous relation phrases by the distributions of their arguments.",
        "However, the distributional hypothesis has several drawbacks.",
        "First, it can confuse antonyms with synonyms because antonymous phrases appear in similar contexts as often as synonymous phrases.",
        "For the same reasons, it also often confuses causes with effects.",
        "For example, DIRT reports that the closest phrase to fall is rise, and the closest phrase to shoot is kill.1 Second, the distributional hypothesis relies on statistics over large corpora to produce accurate similarity statistics.",
        "It remains unclear how to accurately paraphrase less frequent relations with the distributional hypothesis.",
        "Another common approach employs the use of parallel corpora.",
        "News articles are an interesting target, because there often exist articles from different sources describing the same daily events.",
        "This peculiar property allows the use of the temporal assumption, which assumes that phrases in articles published at the same time tend to have similar meanings.",
        "For example, the approaches by Dolan et al. (2004) and Barzilay et al. (2003) identify pairs of sentential paraphrases in similar articles that have appeared in the same period of time.",
        "While these approaches use temporal information as a coarse filter in the data generation stage, they still largely rely on text metrics in the prediction stage.",
        "This not only reduces precision, but also limits the discovery of paraphrases with dissimilar sur",

        "The goal of our research is to develop a technique to generate paraphrases for large numbers of event relation with high precision, using only minimal human effort.",
        "The key to our approach is a joint cluster model using the temporal attributes of news streams, which allows us to identify semantic equivalence of event relation phrases with greater precision.",

        "; ?Armstrong resigns from Livestrong?",
        "and ?Armstrong cuts ties with Livestrong?.",
        "From these we can conclude that the following relation phrases are semantically similar: {step down from, resign from, cut ties with}.",

        "Based on this observation, this paper introduces a novel mechanism to paraphrase relations as summarized in Figure 1.",
        "NEWSSPIKE first applies the ReVerb open information extraction (IE) system (Fader et al., 2011) on the news streams to obtain a set of (a1, r, a2, t) tuples, where the ai are the arguments, r is a relation phrase, and t is the time-stamp of the corresponding news article.",
        "When (a1, a2, t) suggests a real word event, the relation r of (a1, r, a2, t) is likely to describe that event (e.g. (Armstrong, resign from, Livestrong, Oct 17).",
        "We call every (a1, a2, t) an extracted event candidate (EEC), and every relation describing the event an event-mention.",

However, even if we have selected a good EEC for paraphrasing, it is likely that it contains a few relation phrases that are related to (but not synonymous with) the other relations included in the EEC.",
