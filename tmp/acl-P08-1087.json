        "In a study of translation quality for languages in the Europarl corpus, Koehn (2005) reports that translating into morphologically richer languages is more difficult than translating from them.",

        "Our method is based on factored phrase-based statistical machine translation models.",
        "We focused on preprocessing the source data to acquire the needed information and then use it within the models.",
        "We mainly carried out experiments on English to Greek translation, a language pair that exemplifies the problems of translating from a morphologically poor to a morphologically rich language.",
        "When examining parallel sentences of such language pairs, it is apparent that for many English words and phrases which appear usually in the same form, the corresponding terms of the richer target language appear inflected in many different ways.",
        "On a single word-based probabilistic level, it is then obvious that for one specific English word e the probability p(f \\e) of it being translated into a word f decreases as the number of translation candidates increase, making the decisions more uncertain.",

        "The exact rules of agreement are language-dependent and are closely linked to the morphological structure of the language.",
        "Traditional statistical machine translation models deal with this problems in two ways:",
        "• The basic SMT approach uses the target language model as a feature in the argument maximisation function.",
        "This language model is trained on grammatically correct text, and would therefore give a good probability for word sequences that are likely to occur in a sentence, while it would penalise ungrammatical or badly ordered formations.",
        "• Meanwhile, in phrase-based SMT models, words are mapped in chunks.",
        "This can resolve phenomena where the English side uses more than one words to describe what is denoted on the target side by one morphologically inflected term.",
        "Thus, with respect to these methods, there is a problem when agreement needs to be applied on part of a sentence whose length exceeds the order of the of the target n-gram language model and the size of the chunks that are translated (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "In one of the first efforts to enrich the source in word-based SMT, Ueffing and Ney (2003) used part-of-speech (POS) tags, in order to deal with the verb conjugation of Spanish and Catalan; so, POS tags were used to identify the pronoun+verb sequence and splice these two words into one term.",
        "The approach was clearly motivated by the problems occurring by a single-word-based SMT and have been solved by adopting a phrase-based model.",
        "Meanwhile, there is no handling of the case when the pronoun stays in distance with the related verb.",
        "Minkov et al.",
        "(2007) suggested a post-processing system which uses morphological and syntactic features, in order to ensure grammatical agreement on the output.",
        "The method, using various grammatical source-side features, achieved higher accuracy when applied directly to the reference translations but it was not tested as a part of an MT system.",
        "Similarly, translating English into Turkish (Durgar El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2006) uses POS and morph stems in the input along with rich Turkish morph tags on the target side, but improvement was gained only after augmenting the generation process with morphotac-tical knowledge.",

        "(2007) also investigated case determination in Arabic.",
        "Carpuat and Wu (2007) approached the issue as a Word Sense Disambiguation problem.",
        "In their presentation of the factored SMT models, Koehn and Hoang (2007) describe experiments for translating from English to German, Spanish and Czech, using morphology tags added on the morphologically rich side, along with POS tags.",
        "The morphological factors are added on the morphologically rich side and scored with a 7-gram sequence model.",
        "Probabilistic models for using only source tags were investigated by Birch et al.",
        "(2007), who attached syntax hints in factored SMT models by having Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags as factors on the input words, but in this case English was the target language.",
        "This paper reports work that strictly focuses on translation from English to a morphologically richer language.",
        "We go one step further than just using easily acquired information (e.g. English POS or lemmata) and extract target-specific information from the source sentence context.",

        "Then, contrary to the methods that added only output features or altered the generation procedure, we used this information in order to augment only the source side of a factored translation model, assuming that we do not have resources allowing factors or specialized generation in the target language (a common problem, when translating from English into under-resourced languages)."

        "The case agreement for nouns, adjectives and articles is mainly defined by the syntactic role that each noun phrase has.",

        "Similarly, cases which do not actively affect morphology (e.g. dative in Greek) were not tagged during factorization.",
        "For resolving the verb conjugation, we needed to identify the person of a verb and add this piece of linguistic information as a tag.",
        "As we parse the tree top-down, on every level, we look for two discrete nodes which, somewhere in their children, include the verb and the corresponding subject.",

        "In particular, noun cases and verb persons are required by the target language, but not directly inferred by the source.",
        "For each of the sub-problems, our algorithm used heuristic syntax-based rules on the statistically generated syntax tree of each sentence, in order to address the missing information, which was consequently tagged in by means of word factors.",
        "This information was proven to improve the outcome of a factored SMT model, by reducing the grammatical agreement errors on the generated sentences.",
        "An initial system using one translation table with additional source side factors caused sparse data problems, due to the increased number of unseen word-factor combinations.",
        "Therefore, the decoding process is given an alternative path towards a translation table with less or no factors.",
        "The method was tested on translating from English into two morphologically rich languages.",
        "Note that this may be easily expanded for translating from English into many morphologically richer languages with similar attributes.",
        "Opposed to other factored translation model approaches that require target language factors, that are not easily obtainable for many languages, our approach only requires English syntax trees, which are acquired with widely available automatic parsers.",
        "The preprocessing scripts were adapted so that they provide the morphology attributes required by the target language and the best combination of factors and alternative paths was chosen.",
        "This work was supported in part under the Euro-Matrix project funded by the European Commission (6th Framework Programme).",
        "Many thanks to Josh Schroeder for preparing the training, development and test data for Greek, in accordance to the standards of ACL 2007 2nd Workshop on SMT; to Hieu Hoang, Alexandra Birch and all the members of the Edinburgh University SMT group for answering questions, making suggestions and providing support."
