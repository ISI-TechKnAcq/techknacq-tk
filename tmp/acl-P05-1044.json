        "LENGTH is learning a correct distribution, but that distribution is not helpful for the task.",

        "Unlike well-known “bootstrapping” approaches (Yarowsky, 1995), EM and CE have the possible advantage of maintaining posteriors over hidden labels (or structure) throughout learning; bootstrapping either chooses, for each example, a single label, or remains completely agnostic.",
        "One can envision a mixed objective function that tries to fit the labeled examples while discriminating unlabeled examples from their neighborhoods.8 Regardless of how much (if any) data are labeled, the question of good smoothing techniques requires more attention.",

        "We have presented contrastive estimation, a new probabilistic estimation criterion that forces a model to explain why the given training data were better than bad data implied by the positive examples.",
        "We have shown that for unsupervised sequence modeling, this technique is efficient and drastically outperforms EM; for POS tagging, the gain in accuracy over EM is twice what we would get from ten times as much data and improved search, sticking with EM’s criterion (Smith and Eisner, 2004).",
        "On this task, with certain neighborhoods, contrastive estimation suffers less than EM does from diminished prior knowledge and is able to exploit new features – that EM can’t – to largely recover from the loss of knowledge."
