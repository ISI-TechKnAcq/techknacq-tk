        "Statistical language modeling plays an important role in many areas of natural language processing including speech recognition, machine translation, and information retrieval.",
        "The prototypical use of language models is to assign probabilities to sequences of words.",
        "By invoking the chain rule, these probabilities are generally estimated as the product of conditional probabilities P(wi\\hi) of a word w, given the history of preceding words hi = w\\x.",
        "In theory, the history could span any number of words up to W; such as sentences or even a paragraphs.",
        "In practice, however, it has proven challenging to deal with the combinatorial growth in the number of possible histories which in turn impacts reliable parameter estimation.",
        "A simple and effective strategy is to truncate the chain rule to include only the n-l preceding words (n is often set within the range of 3-5).",
        "The simplification reduces the number of free parameters.",
        "However, low values of n impose an artificially local horizon to the language model, and compromise its ability to capture long-range dependencies, such as syntactic relationships, semantic or thematic constraints.",
        "The literature offers many examples of how to overcome this limitation, essentially by allowing the modulation of probabilities by dependencies which extend to words beyond the n-gram horizon.",
        "Cache language models (Kuhn and de Mori, 1992) increase the probability of words observed in the history, e.g., by some factor which decays exponentially with distance.",
        "Trigger models (Rosen-feld, 1996) go a step further by allowing arbitrary word pairs to be incorporated into the cache.",
        "Structured language models (e.g., Roark (2001)) go beyond the representation of history as a linear sequence of words to capture the syntactic constructions in which these words are embedded.",
        "It is also possible to build representations of history which are semantic rather than syntactic (Bellegarda (2000; Coccaro and lurafsky (1998; Gildea and Hofmann (1999)).",
        "In this approach, estimates for the probabilities of upcoming words are derived from a comparison of their semantic content with the content of the history so far.",
        "The semantic representations, in this case, are vectors derived from the distributional properties of words in a corpus, based on the insight that words which are semantically similar will be found in similar contexts (Harris, 1968; Firth, 1957).",
        "Although the the construction of a semantic representation for the history is crucial to this approach, the underlying vector-based models are primarily designed to represent isolated words rather than word sequences.",
        "Ideally, we would like to compose the meaning of the history out of its constituent parts.",
        "This is by no means a new idea.",

        "This is motivated primarily by mathematical convenience rather than by empirical evidence.",
        "In our earlier work (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) we formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced a variety of models based on addition and multiplication.",
        "In this paper we apply vector composition to the problem of constructing predictive history representations for language modeling.",
        "Besides integrating composition with language modeling, a task which is novel to our knowledge, our approach also serves as a valuable testbed of our earlier framework which we originally evaluated on a small scale verb-subject similarity task.",
        "We also investigate how the choice of the underlying semantic representation interacts with the choice of composition function by comparing a spatial model that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space against a probabilistic model that represents words as topic distributions.",
        "Our results show that the proposed composition models yield reductions in perplexity when combined with a standard n-gram model over the n-gram model alone.",
        "We also show that with an appropriate composition function spatial models outperform the more sophisticated topic models.",
        "Finally, we obtain further perplexity reductions when our models are integrated with a structured language model, indicating that the two approaches to language modeling are complementary."

        "The insight that words with similar meanings will tend to be distributed in similar contexts has given rise to a number of approaches that construct semantic representations from corpora.",
        "Broadly speaking, these models come in two flavors.",
        "Semantic space models represent the meaning of words in terms of vectors, with the vector components being derived from the distributional statistics of those words.",
        "Essentially, these models provide a simple procedure for constructing spatial representations of word meaning.",
        "Topic models, in contrast, impose a probabilistic model onto those distributional statistics, under the assumption that hidden topic variables drive the process that generates words.",
        "Both approaches represent the meanings of words in terms of an n-dimensional series of values, but whereas the semantic space model treats those values as defining a vector with spatial properties, the topic model treats them as a probability distribution.",
        "A simple and popular (McDonald, 2000; Bul-linaria and Levy, 2007; Lowe, 2000) way to construct a semantic space model is to associate each vector component with a particular context word, and assign it a value based on the strength of its co-occurrence with the target (i.e., the word for which a semantic representation is being constructed).",
        "For example, in Mitchell and Lapata (2008) we used the 2,000 most frequent content words in a corpus as their contexts, and defined co-occurrence in terms of the context word being present in a five word window on either side of the target word.",
        "We calculated the ratio of the probability of the context word given the target word to the overall probability of the context word and use these values as their vector components.",
        "This procedure has the benefits of simplicity and also of being largely free of any additional theoretical assumptions over and above the distributional approach to semantics.",
        "This is not to say that more sophisticated approaches have not been developed or that they are not useful.",
        "Much work has been devoted to enriching semantic space models with syntactic information (e.g., Grefenstette (1994; Padó and Lapata (2007)), selectional preferences (Erk and Padö, 2008) or with identifying optimal ways of defining the vector components (e.g., Bullinaria and Levy (2007)).",
        "The semantic space discussed thus far is based on word co-occurrence statistics.",
        "However, the statistics of how words are distributed across the documents also carry useful semantic information.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Dumais (1997) utilizes precisely this distributional information to uncover hidden semantic factors by means of dimensionality reduction.",
        "Singular value decomposition (SVD, Berry et al.",
        "(1994)) is applied to a word-document co-occurrence matrix which is factored into a product of a number of other matrices; one of them represents words in terms of the semantic factors and another represents documents in terms of the same factors.",
        "The algebraic relation between these matrices can be used to show that any document vector is a linear combination of the vectors representing the words it contains.",
        "Thus, within this paradigm it is natural to treat multi-word structures as a \"pseudo-document\" and represent them via linear combinations of word vectors.",
        "Due to its generality, LSA has proven a valuable analysis tool with a wide range of applications.",
        "However, the SVD procedure is somewhat ad-hoc lacking a sound statistical foundation.",
        "Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA, Hofmann (2001)) casts the relationship between documents and words in terms of a generative model based on a set of hidden topics.",
        "Documents are represented by distributions over topics and topics are distributions over words.",
        "Thus the mixture of topics in any document determines its vocabulary.",
        "Maximum likelihood estimation of these distributions over a word-document matrix has a comparable effect to SVD in LSA: a set of hidden semantic factors, in this case topics, are extracted and documents and words are represented by these topics.",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Griffiths et al., 2007; Blei et al., 2003) enhances further the mathematical foundation of this approach.",

        "Secondly, the top level Dirichlet distribution is likely to lead to documents being dominated by a small number of topics, producing sparse vectors.",
        "And lastly, the assumption that words are generated independently means the interaction between them is not modeled.",
        "A common approach to embedding semantic representations within language modeling is to measure the semantic similarity between an upcoming word and its history and use it to modify the probabilities from an n-gram model.",
        "In this way, the n-gram's sensitivity to short-range dependencies is enriched with information about longer-range semantic coherence.",
        "Much of previous work has taken this approach (Bellegarda, 2000; Coccaro and lurafsky, 1998; Wandmacher and Antoine, 2007), whilst relying on LSA to provide semantic representations for individual words.",
        "Some authors (Coccaro and lurafsky, 1998; Wandmacher and Antoine, 2007) use the geometric notion of a vector centroid to construct representations of history, whereas others (Bellegarda, 2000; Deng and Khundanpur, 2003) use the idea of a \"pseudo-document\", which is derived from the algebraic relation between documents and words assumed within LSA.",
        "They all derive P(wi \\ hi), the probability of an upcoming word given its history, from the cosine similarity measure which must be somehow normalized in order to yield well-formed probability estimates.",

        "In constructing their representation of history, Gildea and Hofmann (1999) use an online Expectation Maximization process, which derives from the probabilistic basis of pLSA, to update the history with new words.",
        "Extensions on the basic semantic language models sketched above involve representing the history by multiple LSA models of varying granularity in an attempt to capture topic, subtopic, and local information (Zhang and Rudnicky, 2002); incorporating syntactic information by building the semantic space over words and their syntactic annotations (Kanejiya et al., 2004); and treating the LSA similarity as a feature in a maximum entropy language model (Deng and Khundanpur, 2003)."

        "For comparison, Figure 1 plots the perplexity of the combined LDA and n-gram models against the number of topics.",
        "Increasing the number of topics produces higher dimensional representations which ought to be richer, more detailed and therefore more predictive.",
        "While this is true for the additive model, a greater number of topics actually increases the perplexity of the multiplicative model, indicating it has become less predictive.",
        "We compared these perplexity reductions against those obtained with a structured language model.",
        "Following Roark (2001), we combined the structured language model with a trigram model using linear interpolation (the weights were optimized on the development set).",
        "This model (n-gram + parser) performs comparably to our best compositional model (n-gram + MultiplyssM)- While both models incorporate long range dependencies, the parser is trained on a hand annotated treebank, whereas the compositional model uses raw text, albeit from a larger corpus.",
        "Interestingly, when interpolating the trigram with the parser and the compositional models, we obtain additional perplexity reductions.",
        "This suggests that the semantic models are encoding useful predictive information about long range dependencies, which is distinct from and potentially complementary to the parser's syntactic information about such dependencies.",

        "We compared composition models based on addition and multiplication and examined the influence of the underlying semantic space on the composition task.",
        "Our results indicate that the multiplicative composition function produced the most predictive representations with a simple semantic space.",
        "Interestingly, its effect in the LDA setting was detrimental.",
        "Increasing the representational power of the LDA model, by using a greater number of topics, rendered the multiplicative model less predictive.",
        "These results, together with the basic mathematical structure of the LDA model, suggest that it may not be well suited to forming representations for word sequences.",
        "In particular, the assumption that words are generated independently within documents prevents the interactions between words being modeled.",
        "This assumption, along with the Dirichlet prior on document distributions tends to lead to highly sparse word vectors, with a typical word being strongly associated with only one or two topics.",
        "Multiplication of a number of these vectors generally produces a vector in which most of these associations have been obliterated by the sparse components, resulting in a representation with little predictive power.",
