        "In earlier papers devoted to interpersonal interaction (Frank,1981; Levinson,1981] much attention is paid to studying the role of speech act (SA) in dialogue structure.",
        "Considering SA as a principal functional element of language interaction (LI) is of special importance for developing natural language models which are to be practically applied to human-computer natural--language interaction.",
        "We proceed from the statement that there are not solitary performed speech acts in real communication, SAs are interconnected and involved in a general LI structure [Wunderlich,1980].",
        "Within the framework of our approach to the formal description of dialogue structure a notion of SR-triad reflecting the \"stimulus-reaction\" relation between utterances in the dialogue is proposed to construct a more adequate representation of dialogue structure.",
        "Representing any dialogue as a triad structure (T-structure) in contrast to previous analysis [Hundsnurscher,1981] is characterized by distinguishing three phases in the interaction of the type \"stimulus-reaction\".",
        "First we shall consider different roles of speech acts in the dialogue T-structure.",
        "Then we shall introduce three types of relations between SR-triads (intersection, imbedding and succession) and discuss dialogues with a complicated structure which is represented by combinations of these relations and reflects different strategies to attain some goal.",
        "2.",
        "SR-TRIAD AND A TYPOLOGY OF SAS Any dialogue is considered to be a sequence of SAs distributed in time which is charaterized by: a) a change of roles of the speaker and the hearer between communication participants (further designated as X and Y) and b) certain relations between SAs Each SA is aimed at accomplishing whole complex of goals/tasks.",
        "The discussion of their content is not relevant to the purposes of this paper.",
        "So we confine our discussion to one goal (g.X) only associated with some SA of the author X (SA.X).",
        "The very fact of producing an SA which \"initiates\" g.X raises before the addressee Y a communicative task to react to this goal, i.e. to close g.X positively or negatively.",
        "Thus between SA.X and the following SAs of Y there appear \"stimulus- reaction\" relations.",
        "Between an initiation and a closure of g.X there may take place intermediate interactions aimed at accomplishing the communicative task by Y.",
        "The intermediate SAs of Y are associated with goals subordinated to the communicative task, and the intermediate SAs of X which are reactions to the corresponding SAs-stimuli of Y are associated with the initiating SA.X by the goal g.X and aimed at explanation, supporting, correction of the goal or some other components of the SA.X content.",
        "2.1.",
        "In the capacity of the basic structural element of dialogue interaction, SR-triad is proposed which reflects three following phases of the interaction these phases being associated with any goal initiated in the dialogue.",
        "The first phase is a speech act SA1.X by means of which its author X induces his dialogue partner Y to realize some communicative goal g.X (initiation of g.X).",
        "The second phase is represented by a positive or negative reaction SA1.Y of Y to this goal (closure of g.X).",
        "The third phase is a reaction SA2.X of X to SALY which may be positive (acceptance) or negative (rejection) as well.",
        "Often SA2.X may be absent in real dialogues that means an acceptance of Y's reaction by default (as it follows from the completion of the interaction or from the transition to the initiation of a new goal).",
        "Irrespective of the explicit/implicit form of expression, this phase is considered as a regular organizing component of the interaction process.",
        "2,2.",
        "Let us enumerate principal types of speech acts reflecting the roles of the SA in the dialogue T-structure and introduce symbols to designate them in schemes.",
        "(1) An initiating SA is a primary initiation of the goal (see the designation in fig.",
        "la).",
        "*) (2) An initiative-reactive SA is an initiation of an intermediate goal without trying to close the principal goal, for example, the author of the given SA has not sufficient information for generating a reaction to the principal goal, or the information at the author's disposal is considered by the author as non-authentic, gives rise to doubt, needs correction etc.",
        "Such an SA is aimed at some component of the content of the previous SA (the connection with this component is designated by a dotted line (see fig.lb)).",
        "(3) A reactive SA is a positive or negative reaction (to the goal) reflecting the second phase of an SR-triad (fig.lc).",
        "This reaction may be",
        "*)Here and further (in schemes) a horizontal line represents a goal with which the role of the given SA is connected in an SR-triad; a line representing a subordinated goal is shown lower than that representing the principal goal.",
        "recognized by X as final: an SA of type (4) follows and the goal is closed, otherwise the reaction is not final: an SA of type (5) follows.",
        "(4) A completing SA reflects the third phase of an SR-triad and contains the acceptance of the previous positive or negative reaction of the partner (fig.ld).",
        "(5) A re-initiating SA is a re-initiation of the goal which means rejection of the reaction to the given goal and plays a double role in the dialogue T-structure: such an SA simultaneously reflects the third phase of one triad and the first phase of the other triad which follows it immediately (fig.li).",
        "In any dialogue complex SAs representing the combinations of the enumerated structural types are possible.",
        "Let us list some of them:",
        "(6) An initiating complex SA is a primary initiation of the goal with a complication, e.g. with a motivation (fig.lf).",
        "(7) A reactive-initiative complex SA is a closure of the goal with a complication, for example: a) a positive closure with a counter-condition; b) a negative closure with a motivation(fig.1g). 1- ---h",

        "The intersection of SR-triads represents the T-structure of a dialogue containing a motivated refusal which is a negative reaction to the goal g.X initiated by SA1.X (e.g. to a request).",
        "This reaction includes a motive of the refusal satisfying X (see a structural scheme given in fig.3).",
        "SALY is a negative reaction to g.X with the initiation of a reason aimed at the component C of the SAl.X content.",
        "SA2.X is a positive reaction to the reason with the removal of the goal g.X.",
        "SA2.Y is an acceptance of X's reaction to the reason by Y (possibly by default).",
        "In any real dialogue the refusal may be expressed indirectly, i.e. SALY contains only the reason for non-performing the action to which Y is induced.",
        "The imbedding of SR-triads characterizes the T-structure of the dialogue containing an initiating complex SA, consists of the initiation of g.X with a motivation (e.g. giving an argument for the goal g.X).",
        "In this case four kinds of the goal closure are possible (fig.4(a-d)).",
        "To illustrate these schemes, let us give the following variants of the dialogue:*) SA1.X:Would you go with me, it is very necessary for me.",
        "SALY:(a)Agreed,I'm all for it.",

        "SA2.X:I see.",
        "The succession of SR-triads describes the following cases: (a) the dialogue in which goals are initiated and closed in turns; the connection between these goals is not considered in the T-structure (see fig.5).",
        "*) Certain artificiality of the examples is due to the trend to adduce \"pure\" illustrations which are not complicated by components beyond the scope of the schemes considered.",
        "SA1.Y: It is at six o'clock in the afternoon.",
        "SA2.X: How much does the grown-up ticket cost?",

        "SA3.X: Thanks.",
        "(b) the dialogue containing the re-initiating SA2.X.",

        "More complicated dialogue T-structures represent combinations of the above types of the relations between SR-triads.",
        "These dialogues include intermediate speech acts: each SA initiating a subordinated goal opens an intermediate SR-triad which complicates the dialogue structure.",
        "Thus, for example, in a dialogue the speech acts of X, which are connected with the principal goal initiated by the SA1.X, may be defined as \"insisting\" or \"persuading\".",
        "This is the case if Y \"offers resis-tance\" to X, i.e. Y objects, expresses doubts or advances counterarguments.",

        "SA3.Y is:(a) an acceptance of X's answer [by default]; (b) a positive reaction to the principal goal g.X (agreement).",
        "In the above communicative situation the participant X may choose another strategy of attaining his principal goal g.X: X may initiate g.X not at once but \"to pave the way\" for it, for instance, to let Y know of the lecture, to elucidate the degree of his interest and, if necessary, to raise it, i.e. to construct a sequence of auxiliary SAs and then to advance the principal SA.X(offer).",

        "g.X",
        "The above SR-triad, being the basic structural element of language interaction, reflects the interconnection of SAs according to the type of the \"stimulus-reaction\" relation.",
        "It is of special importance for us to distinguish the third phase which means that the positive or negative reaction of a participant to a certain goal initiated by his partner becomes final only after the acceptance (approval) of this reaction by the initiator of the goal.",
        "It should be noted that even a positive closure of g.X by Y does not always satisfy X, e.g. a prompt agreement is interpreted by X as thoughtless and insufficiently reasonable.",
        "The acceptance of a reaction by a dialogue participant may happen at different levels of the interaction.",
        "Thus if Y gives advice to X's request for an advice (there are no violations at the communicative level) but the content of the advice (so-called extracommunicative information) does not satisfy X, then he looks in the content of the advice for the reason of initiating a further discussion.",
        "The above offered apparatus for describing the dialogue T-structure with the use of additional means reflecting the character of a connection between the goals can, apparently, be applied for integral multilevel structural representation of LI.",
        "In the paper we have limited ourselves to the consideration of a dialogue (or a fragment of a dialogue) subordinated to one goal, its development, achievement or removal.",
        "However, except the dialogue connectedness with respect to goal, other types of SAs connectedness in a dialogue may be discussed, e.g. a thematic one.",
        "The dynamics of the development of the theme does not always correspond to the development of the goal.",
        "The introduction of the notion of the theme and the investigation of its relations to the goals will allow us to represent a thematic structure to accompany the T-structure of a dialogue or to be combined with it."
