        "In natural language processing, two aspects of CRFs have been investigated sufficiently: one is to apply it to new tasks, such as named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003; Li and McCallum, 2003; Settles, 2004), part-of-speech tagging (Laf-ferty et al., 2001), shallow parsing (Sha and Perei-ra, 2003), and language modeling (Roark et al., 2004); the other is to exploit new training methods for CRFs, such as improved iterative scaling (Lafgradient tree boosting (Dietterich et al., 2004).",
        "One of the critical steps is to select optimal feature subset before employing CRFs.",
        "McCallum (2003) suggested an efficient method of feature induction by iteratively increasing conditional log-likelihood for discrete features.",
        "However, since there are millions of features and feature selection is an NP problem, this is intractable when searching optimal feature subset.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary that selects feature at feature template level, which reduces input scale from millions of features to tens or hundreds of candidate templates.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method that adopts ME and MEMMs instead of CRFs to improve the efficiency of selecting optimal feature template subset considering the homology between ME, MEMMs, and CRFs, which reduces the training time from hours to minutes without loss of performance.",

        "We propose our optimal method for feature template selection in Section 3.",

        "Feature selection can be carried out from two levels: feature level (feature selection, or FS), or feature template level (feature template selection, or FTS).",
        "FS has been sufficiently investigated and share most concepts with FTS.",
        "For example, the target of FS is to select a subset from original feature set, whose optimality is measured by an evaluation criterion (Liu and Yu, 2005).",
        "Similarly, the target of FTS is to select a subset from original feature template set.",
        "To achieve optimal feature subset, two problems in original set must be eliminated: irrelevance and redundancy (Yu and Liu, 2004).",
        "The only difference between FS and FTS is that the number of elements in feature template set is much less than that in feature set.",
        "Liu and Yu (2005) classified FS models into three categories: the filter model, the wrapper model, and the hybrid model.",
        "The filter model 2004) relies on general characteristics of the data to evaluate and select feature subsets without any machine learning model.",
        "The wrapper model (Dy",
        "John, 1997) requires one predetermined machine learning model and uses its performance as the evaluation criterion.",
        "The hybrid model (Das, 2001) attempts to take advantage of the two models by exploiting their different evaluation criteria in different search stages.",
        "There are two reasons to employ the wrapper model to accomplish FTS: (1) The wrapper model tends to achieve better effectiveness than that of the filter model with respect of a more direct evaluation criterion; (2) The computational cost is tractable because it can reduce the number of subsets sharply by heuristic algorithm according to the human knowledge.",
        "And our method belongs to this type.",
        "Lafferty (2001) noticed the homology between MEMMs and CRFs, and chose optimal MEMMs parameter vector as a starting point for training the corresponding CRFs.",
        "And the training process of CRFs converges faster than that with all zero parameter vectors.",
        "On the other hand, the general framework that processes sequential labeling with CRFs has also been investigated well, which can be described as follows:"

        "Besides the homology of these models, the other necessary condition to replace CRFs with ME or MEMMs for FTS is that all kinds of feature templates in CRFs can also be expressed by ME or MEMMs.",
