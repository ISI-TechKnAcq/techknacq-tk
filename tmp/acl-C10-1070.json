        "Identifying translations of terms in comparable corpora is a challenge that has attracted many researchers.",
        "A popular idea that emerged for solving this problem is based on the assumption that the context of a term and its translation share similarities that can be used to rank translation candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999).",
        "Many variants of this idea have been implemented.",
        "While a few studies have investigated pattern matching approaches to compare source and target contexts (Fung, 1995; Diab and Finch, 2000; Yu and Tsujii, 2009), most variants make use of a bilingual lexicon in order to translate the words of the context of a term (often called seed words).",
        "Dejean et al.",
        "(2005) instead use a bilingual thesaurus for translating these.",
        "Another distinction between approaches lies in the way the context is defined.",
        "The most common practice, the so-called window-based approach, defines the context words as those cooc-curing significantly with the source term within windows centered around the term.",
        "Some studies have reported gains by considering syntactically motivated co-occurrences.",
        "Yu and Tsujii (2009) propose a resource-intensive strategy which requires both source and target dependency parsers, while Otero (2007) investigates a lighter approach where a few hand coded regular expressions based on POS tags simulate source parsing.",
        "The latter approach only requires a POS tagger of the source and the target languages as well as a small parallel corpus in order to project the source regular expressions.",
        "Naturally, studies differ in the way each cooccurrence (either window or syntax-based) is weighted, and a plethora of association scores have been investigated and compared, the likelihood score (Dunning, 1993) being among the most popular.",
        "Also, different similarity measures have been proposed for ranking target context vectors, among which the popular cosine measure.",
        "The goal of the different authors who investigate context-projection approaches also varies.",
        "Some studies are tackling the problem of identifying the translation of general words (Rapp, others are addressing the translation of domain specific terms.",
        "Among the latter, many are translating single-word terms (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Dejean et al., 2005; Prochasson et al., 2009), while others are tackling the translation of multi-word terms (Daille and Morin, 2005).",
        "The type of discourse might as well be of concern in some of the studies dedicated to bilingual terminology mining.",
        "For instance, Morin et al.",
        "(2007) distinguish popular science versus scientific terms, while Saralegi et al.",
        "(2008) target popular science terms only.",
        "The present discussion only focuses on a few number of representative studies.",
        "Still, it is already striking that a direct comparison of them is difficult, if not impossible.",
        "Differences in resources being used (in quantities, in domains, etc.",
        "), in technical choices made (similarity measures, context vector computation, etc.)",
        "and in objectives (general versus terminological dictionary extraction) prevent one from establishing a clear landscape of the various approaches.",
        "Indeed, many studies provide some figures that help to appreciate the influence of some parameters in a given experimental setting.",
        "Notably, Otero (2008) studies no less than 7 similarity measures for ranking context vectors while comparing window and syntax-based methods.",
        "Morin et al.",
        "(2007) consider both the log-likelihood and the mutual information association scores as well as the Jaccard and the cosine similarity measures.",
        "Ideally, a benchmark on which researchers could run their translation finder would ease the comparison of the different approaches.",
        "However, designing such a benchmark that would satisfy the evaluation purposes of all the researchers is far too ambitious a goal for this contribution.",
        "Instead, we investigate the impact of some major factors influencing projection-based approaches on a task of translating 5,000 terms of the medical domain (the most studied domain), making use of French and English Wikipedia pages extracted monolingually thanks to an information retrieval engine.",
        "While the present work does not investigate all the parameters that could potentially impact results, we believe it constitutes the most complete and systematic comparison made so far with variants of the context-based projection approach.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe the projection-based approach to translation spotting in Section 2 and detail the parameters that directly influence its performance.",
        "The experimental protocol we followed is described in Section 3 and we analyze our results in Section 4.",
        "We discuss the main results in the light of previous work and propose some future avenues in Section 5."

        "The approach we investigate for identifying term translations in comparable corpora is similar to (Rapp, 1999) and many others.",
        "We describe in the following the different steps it encompasses and the parameters we are considering in the light of typical choices made in the literature.",
        "Step 1 A comparable corpus is constructed for each term to translate.",
        "In this study, the source and target corpora are sets of Wikipedia pages related to the source term (S) and its reference translation (T) respectively (see Section 3.1).",
        "The degree of corpus preprocessing varies greatly from one study to another.",
        "Complex linguistic tools such as terminological extractors (Daille and Morin, 2005), parsers (Yu and Tsujii, 2009) or lemma-tizers (Rapp, 1999) are sometimes used.",
        "In our case, the only preprocessing that takes place is the deletion of the Wikipedia symbols pertaining to its particular syntax (e.g. [[ ]] ).",
        "It is to be noted that, for the sake of simplicity and generality, our implementation does not exploit inter-language links nor structural elements specific to Wikipedia documents, as opposed to (Yu and Tsujii, 2009).",
        "Step 2 A context vector vs for the source term S is built (see Figure 1 for a made-up example).",
        "This vector contains the words that are in the context of the occurrences of S and are strongly correlated to S. The definition of \"context\" is one of the parameters whose best value we want to find.",
        "Context length can be based on a number of units, for instance 3 sentences (Daille and Morin, 2005), windows of 3 (Rapp, 1999) or 25 words (Prochas-son et al., 2009), etc.",
        "It is an important parameter of the projection-based approach.",
        "Should the context length be too small, we would miss words that would be relevant in finding the translation.",
        "On the other hand, if the context is too large, it might contain too much noise.",
        "At this step, a sto-plist made of function words is applied in order to filter out context words and reduce noise in the context vector.",
        "Additionally, an association measure is used to score the strength of correlation between S and the words in its contexts; it serves to normalize corpus frequencies.",
        "Words that have a high association score with S are more prominent in the context vector.",
        "The association measure is the second important parameter we want to study.",
        "As already noted, most authors use the log-likelihood ratio to measure the association between collocates; some, like (Rapp, 1999), informally compare the performance of a small number of association measures, or combine the results obtained with different association measures (Daille and",
        "Morin, 2005).",
        "Step 3 Words in vs are projected into the target language with the help of the bilingual seed lexicon (Figure 2).",
        "Each word in vs which is present in the bilingual lexicon is translated, and those translations define the projected context vector vp.",
        "Words that are not found in the bilingual lexicon are simply ignored.",
        "The size of the seed lexicon and its content are therefore two important parameters of the approach.",
        "In previous studies, seed lexicons vary between 16,000 (Rapp, 1999) and 65,000 (Dejean et al., 2005) entries, a typical size being around 20,000 (Fung, 1998; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Daille and Morin, 2005).",
        "Step 4 Context vectors vt are computed for each candidate term in the target language corpus (Figure 3).",
        "The dimension of the target-vector space is defined to be the one induced by the projection mechanism described in Step 3.",
        "The context vector vt of each candidate term is computed as in Step 2.",
        "Therefore, in Step 4, the parameters of context definition and association measure are important and take the same values as those in Step 2.",
        "Note that in this study, on top of all single terms, we also consider target bigrams as potential candidates (99.5 % of our reference target terms are composed of at most two words).",
        "As such, our method can handle complex terms (of up to two words), as opposed to most previous studies, without having to resort to a separate terminological extraction as in (Daille and Morin, 2005).",
        "aspinn: drugstore: physician:",
        "Step 5 Context vectors vt are ranked in decreasing order of their similarity with vp (Figure 4).",

        "This is very specific to our task where medical terms often (but not always) share Latin or Greek roots, such as microvillosités in French and microvilli in English.",
        "In this heuristic, translation candidates which are cognates of the source term are ranked first among the list of translation candidates.",
        "In our implementation, two words are cognates if their first four characters are identical (Simard et al., 1992).",

        "As Table 5 shows, cosine has slightly better Top 1 figures, while Dice is a little better when considering the Top 20 translation candidates.",
        "Therefore, as previously mentioned, the choice of similarity measure (cosine or Dice) should depend on the goal of translation spotting.",

        "According to our results, translation spotting is more accurate when the seed lexicon contains (5,000) entries from both the medical domain and general language instead of general language words only, but only by a very small margin.",
        "Table 6 shows the results for the configuration LO_cosine_sentence.",
        "The fact that the difference is so small could be explained by our resources' properties.",

        "Wikipedia documents retrieved by using those references may in turn not belong to the medical domain, in which case medical terms from the seed lexicon are not appropriate.",
        "Still, the relatively good performance of the general language-only lexicon supports (Dejean et al., 2005, p. 119)'s claim that general language words are useful when spotting translations of domain specific terms, since the latter can appear in generic contexts.",
        "Lexicon sizes tested are 5,000 (the mixed lexicon used in previous experiments), 7,000, 9,000 and 11,000 entries.",
        "The performance (based on MAP) is better when 7,000- and 9,000-entry lexicons are used, because more source language context words can be taken into account.",
        "However, when the lexicon reaches 11,000, Top 1 MAP scores and F-measures are slightly lower than those obtained with the 7,000-entry one.",
        "This may happen because the lexicon is increased with general language words; 9,000 of the 11,000 entries",
