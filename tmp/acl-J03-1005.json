        "(1993).",
        "Since the number of possible translations of a given source sentence is enormous, we must find the best output without actually generating the set of all possible translations; instead we would like to focus on the most likely translation hypotheses during the search process.",
        "For this purpose, we present a data-driven beam search algorithm similar to the one used in speech recognition search algorithms (Ney et al.",
        "1992).",
        "The major difference between the search problem in speech recognition and statistical MT is that MT must take into account the different word order for the source and the target language, which does not enter into speech recognition.",

        "Although the resulting search procedure is very fast, the preprocessing is language specific and requires a lot of manual work.",

        "A data-driven beam search approach is presented on the basis of this DP-based algorithm.",

        "By imposing constraints on the possible word reorderings similar to that described in Berger et al.",

        "The original reordering constraint in Berger et al.",

        "Additionally, a set of four states is introduced to deal with grammatical reordering restrictions (e.g., for the translation direction German to English, the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.",
        "In combination with the reordering restrictions, a data-driven beam search organization for the search procedure is proposed.",

        "A partial hypothesis is said to cover a set of source sentence positions when exactly the positions in the set have already been processed in the search process.",

        "(1999) and in Och and Ney (2000).",
        "The argmax operation denotes the search problem (i.e., the generation of the output sentence in the target language).",
        "The overall architecture of the statistical translation approach is summarized in Figure 1.",
        "In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm.",
        "The transformations may range from simple word categorization to more complex preprocessing steps that require some parsing of the source string.",
        "In this article, however, we will use only word categorization as an explicit transformation step.",
        "In the search procedure both the language and the translation model are applied after the text transformation steps.",
        "The following “types” of parameters are used for the IBM-4 translation model: Lexicon probabilities: We use the lexicon probability p(f I e) for translating the single target word e as the single source word f. A source word f may be translated by the “null” word e0 (i.e., it does not produce any target word e).",

        "In Brown et al.",
        "(1993), two types of distortion probabilities are distinguished: (1) the leftmost word of a set of source words f aligned to the same target word e (which is called the “head”) is placed, and (2) the remaining source words are placed.",
        "Two separate distributions are used for these two cases.",
        "For placing the “head” the center function center(i) (Brown et al.",
        "[1993] uses the notation Oi) is used: the average position of the source words with which the target word ei_1 is aligned.",
        "The distortion probabilities are class-based: They depend on the word class J7(f) of a covered source word f as well as on the word class E (e) of the previously generated target word e. The classes are automatically trained (Brown et al.",
        "1992).",
        "When the IBM-4 model parameters are used during search, an input sentence can be processed one source position at a time in a certain order primarily determined by the distortion probabilities.",
        "We will use the following simplified set of translation model parameters: lexicon probabilities p(f I e) and distortion probabilities p(j I j',J).",
        "Here, j is the currently covered input sentence position and j' is the previously covered input sentence position.",
        "The input sentence length J is included, since we would like to think of the distortion probability as normalized according to J.",
        "No fertility probabilities or “null” word probabilities are used; thus each source word f is translated as exactly one target word e and each target word e is translated as exactly one source word f. The simplified notation will help us to focus on the most relevant details of the DP-based search procedure.",
        "The simplified set of parameters leads to an unrealistic assumption about the length of the source and target sentence, namely, I = J.",
        "During the translation experiments we will, of course, not make this assumption.",
