        "Chinese morphological analysis is a fundamental problem that has been studied extensively [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",
        "Researchers make use of word or character features to cope with this problem.",
        "However, neither of them seems completely satisfactory.",
        "In general, a simple word-based approach can achieve about 90% accuracy for segmentation with a medium-size dictionary.",
        "However, since no dictionary includes every Chinese word, the unknown word (or Out Of Vocabulary, OOV) problem [9], [10] can severely affect the performance of word-based approaches.",
        "Furthermore, word-based models have an estimation bias when faced with segmentation candidates with different numbers of words.",
        "For example, in the standard hidden Markov model, the best result,T = argmaxp(TIW)=argmaxf~[p(w 11)pft |V^m), is related to the number of the words in the segmentation candidates.",
        "As such, a candidate with fewer words is preferred over those with more words in the selection process.",
        "Therefore, most word-based models are likely to fail when a combinational ambiguity sequence is separated into multiple words.",
        "A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphological Analysis 543",
        "Compared with Chinese words, Chinese characters are relatively less unambiguous.",
        "The Chinese character set is very limited.",
        "Therefore, unknown characters occur rarely in a sentence.",
        "The grammatical advantages of characters have inspired researchers to adopt character features in Chinese morphology and parsing [5], [6], [11], [12].",
        "However, it is difficult to incorporate necessary word features, such as the form of a Chinese word and its fixed part-of-speech tags, in most character-based approaches.",
        "For this reason, character-based approaches have not achieved satisfactory performance in large-scale open tests.",
        "In this paper, we propose a lexicon-constrained character model to combine the merits of both approaches.",
        "We explore how to capture the Chinese word building rules using a statistical method, which reflects the regularities in the word formation process.",
        "First, a character hidden Markov method assigns the candidate tags to each character.",
        "Next, a large-size word list combined with linguistic information is used to filter out erroneous candidates.",
        "Finally, segmentation and part-of-speech tagging for the sentence are provided based on the character tags.",
        "The proposed model solves the problems of unknown word detection, word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging using both word and character features.",
        "Additionally, our module is a post-processing module, which can be coupled to any existing Chinese morphological system; and it can readily recall some of the unknown words omitted by the system, and as a result, significantly improves the overall performance.",
        "Evaluations of the proposed system on SIGHAN open test sets indicate that our method outperforms the best bakeoff results on 3 test sets, and ranks 2nd in the 4thtest set [9].",

        "It is recognized that there are some regularities in the process of forming words from Chinese characters.",
        "This in general can be captured by word building rules.",
        "In this paper, we explore a statistical model to acquire such rules.",
        "The following are some definitions used in the proposed model.",
        "[Def.",
        "1] character position feature",
        "We use four notations to denote the position of a character in a Chinese word.",
        "'F' means the first character of the word, 'L' the last character, 'M' is a character within it and 'S' the word itself.",
        "[Def.",
        "2] character tag set",
        "It is the product of the set of character position features and the set of part-of-speech tags.",
        "Character tag set ={xylxe word POS set, y e {S,F,M,L}}, where, x denotes one part-of-speech (POS) tag and y a character position feature.",
        "Together they are used to define the rules of Chinese word formation.",
        "[Def.",
        "3] character tagging",
        "Given a Chinese sentence; character tagging is the process for assigning a character tag to each character in the sentence.",
        "Word building rules are acquired based on the relation between the character and the corresponding character tag.",
        "Word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging can be achieved easily based on the result of character tagging.",
        "For example, a character with 'xS' is a single character word with the part-of-speech tag 'x'; a character sequence starting with 'xF' and ending with 'xL' is a multiple character word with the part-of-speech tag 'x'.",
        "The elementary model adopts the character bi-gram hidden Markov model.",
        "In hidden Markov model, given the sentence, s : c1c2...cn_lcn, and character tagging result t : xy 1 xy 2...xy n-1 xy n, the probability of result t of s is estimated as:",
        "The best character tagging result for the sentences is given by equation (2):",
        "We used the People's Daily Corpus of 1998 [13] to train this model.",
        "Also we adopted a 100,000-word dictionary listing all valid part-of-speech tags for each Chinese word in the training phase to solve the data sparseness problem.",
        "The training data are converted into character tagging data through the following steps: a single character word with 'x' is converted into the character marked with tag 'xS'; a two-character word with 'x' is converted into a first character with 'xF' and a second character with ' xL'; a word with more than two characters with 'x' are converted into a first character with 'xF', middle characters with 'xM' and last character with 'xL'.",
        "We adopt the POS tag set from the People's Daily Corpus, which consists of 46 tags.",
        "Taking into account of the four position features, the final character tag set is comprised of 184 tags.",
        "The emitted probability and transition probability of the model are estimated by the maximum likelihood method.",
        "The emitted probability is counted by the training Corpus and the dictionary, where the Chinese words in the dictionary are counted one time.",
        "The transition probability is trained from the training Corpus only.",
        "We tested the above model based on the SIGHAN open test set [9].",
        "The average precision for word segmentation was more than 88%.",
        "This means that most of the word building rules in Chinese have been obtained by the elementary model.",
        "However, the performance was relatively inferior to other word segmentation systems.",
        "It indicated that the model needed more features to learn word building rules.",
        "In error analysis, we found that the elementary model was so flexible that it produced many pseudo-words and invalid part-of-speech tags.",
        "In practice, a Chinese word is a stable sequence of Chinese characters, whose formation and part-of-speech tags are fixed by long-term usage.",
        "It seemed that only character position and meaning cannot describe a word building rule effectively.",
        "We also observed that word segmentation systems based on a simple dictionary matching algorithm and a few linguistic rules could achieve about 90% accuracy [14].",
        "This suggested that a lexicon may have contribution to word building rules.",
        "Thus, we tried to incorporate a lexicon to the model to improve the performance.",
        "A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphological Analysis 545",
        "The major errors in the elementary model were pseudo words and invalid part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "We proposed two constraints based on the lexicon to deal with these errors:",
        "1.",
        "If a possible word produced from the elementary model is in the word-dictionary, the character tag of the characters forming this word should be consistent with the part-of-speech tag of the word in the dictionary.",
        "2.",
        "If a possible word produced is not in the dictionary, it must include one or more single characters, and none of which may be subsumed by any word in the dictionary in the current context.",
        "The first constraint eliminates invalid character tags.",
        "For example, the character ' QM' has six character tags: 'aF' (first in adjective) , 'dF' (first in adverb), 'nF' (first in noun), 'nrF' (first in person name), 'tF' (first in time), and 'vF' (first in verb).",
        "The character 'X has five character tags: 'dL', 'nL', 'nrL', 'tU, and 'vL'.",
        "The combination of the two characters produces the possible word ' ', which includes five possible word part-of-speech tags: 'd', 'n', 'nr', 't', and 'v' based on these character tags.",
        "But ' ' is a word in the dictionary, which only has two valid part-of-speech tags, namely, 'time' and 'person name'.",
        "Obviously, the part-of-speech tags: 'd', 'n' and V of ' #7?",
        "are invalid.",
        "Accordingly, the tags 'aF', 'dF', 'nF', 'vF on ' and the tags 'dL', 'nL', 'vL on are also invalid.",
        "So they should be pruned from the candidates of the character tagging.",
        "The second constraint prunes pseudo words in the elementary model.",
        "Many studies in dictionary-based segmentation treat unknown words as sequences of single characters [1], [14].",
        "The second constraint ensures that the new word produced by the elementary model must have one or more 'unattached' single characters (not subsumed by any other words).",
        "For example, the sequence ' ' (program error) will combine the pseudo word 'Jf^'fin because of the tag 'nF' on 'ffî and the tag 'nL' on ' '.",
        "The second constraint will prune ' ' since ' ' (program) and ' ' (error) are already in the dictionary and there is no \"unattached\" single character in it.",
        "Accordingly, the tag 'nF' on 7^' and the tag 'nL' on will be deleted from the candidates of character tagging.",
        "The following experiments show the lexicon-based constraints are very effective in eliminating error cases.",
        "The elementary model faces an average of 9.3 character tags for each character.",
        "The constraints will prune 70% of these error tags from it.",
        "As a result, the performance of character tagging is improved.",
        "It is worth noting that the lexicon in the elementary model cannot distort the probability of the character tagging results in the model.",
        "The pruned cases are invalid cases which cannot occur in the training data because all the words and POS tags in the training data are valid.",
        "Thus, the model built from the training data is not affected by the pruning process.",
        "In this subsection, we illustrate the advantages of the proposed method for Chinese morphology with an example.",
        "Example:",
        "(Xiaoming will analyze the program errors tomorrow).",
        "Where, ' shffi is an unknown word (person name), and the sequence '#Jf is a combinational ambiguity (either 'ffîM' (put up with) or l$f+ 'Jf' (will)).",
        "Here is how our approach works.",

        "Step 2: Prune the invalid candidates using constraints.",
        "The first constraint prunes some invalid character tags.",
        "For example, ' ' can be either an adverb (d) or a personal name (nr); ' ' is a time (t) word.",
        "The other part-of-speech tags of these two words will be deleted.",
        "With the second constraint, we can delete ' ' because ' ' and ' ' are words in the dictionary.",

        "The same corpus and word-dictionary were used to train the above three systems.",
        "The training data set was the 5-month People's Daily Corpus of 1998, which contained approximately 6,300,000 words and 46 word part-of-speech tags.",
        "The system dictionary contained 100,000 words and the valid part-of-speech tag(s) of each word.",

        "We notice that word-based approaches and character-based approaches have similar precision on unknown word identification, however word-based approaches have much lower recall than character-based ones.",
