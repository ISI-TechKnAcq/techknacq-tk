        "\", to request the time, to express a complaint, or to ask a yes-no question.",

We allow that individuals might not all share the same taxonomy of speech acts and linguistic intentions and that certain social groups or activities might have their own specialized sets of linguistic expectations.9 Our theory supports this flexibility by having each speaker evaluate the coherence of all utterances within her own view of the discourse.",
