        "We conduct this decoding experiment on 247 system generated and 151 human generated perceivable morphs with perceivability scores > 70% from human evaluation.",
        "Figure 1 shows that in general the decoder achieves lower discovery rate on system generated morphs than human generated ones, because the identification component in the decoder was trained based on human morph related features.",
        "This result is promising because it demonstrates that the system generated morphs contain new and unique characteristics which are unknown to the decoder.",
        "In contrast, from Figure 2 we can see that system generated morphs can be more easily resolved into the right target entities than human generated ones which are more implicit.",

        "We incorporated the pronunciation, lexical and semantic similarity measurements proposed in these approaches.",
        "Some of our basic selection criteria are also similar to the constraints used in previous work on generating humors (Val- itutti et al., 2013; Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).",
        "5 Conclusions and Future Work This paper proposed a new problem of encoding entity morphs and developed a wide variety of novel automatic approaches.",
        "In the future we will focus on improving the language-independent approaches based on historical figure mapping and culture and reputation modeling.",
        "In addition, we plan to extend our approaches to other types of information including sensitive events, satires and metaphors so that we can generate fable stories.",
        "We are also interested in tracking morphs over time to study the evolution of Internet language.",
