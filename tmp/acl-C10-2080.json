        "Most of traditional search engines are designed to return identical result to the same query even for different users.",
        "However, it has been found that majority of queries are quite ambiguous (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002) as well as too short (Silverstein et al., 1999) to describe the exact informational needs of users.",
        "Different users may have completely different information needs under the same query (Jansen et al., 2000).",
        "For example, when users issue a query \"Java\" to a search engine, their needs can be something ranging from a programming language to a kind of coffee.",
        "In order to solve this problem, personalized search is proposed, which is a typical strategy of utilizing individual user information.",
        "Pitkow et al.",
        "(2002) describe personalized search as the contextual computing approach which focuses on understanding the information consumption patterns of each user, the various information foraging strategies and applications they employ, and the nature of the information itself.",
        "After that, personalized search has gradually developed into one of the hot topics in information retrieval.",
        "As for various personalization models proposed recently, Dou et al.",
        "(2007), however, reveal that they actually harms the results for certain queries while improving others.",
        "This result based on a large-scale experiment challenges not only the current personalization methods but also the motivation to improve web search by the personalized strategies.",
        "In addition, the studies on query logs recorded by search engines consistently report the prevailing repeated query submissions by large number of users (Silverstein et al., 1999; Spink et al., 2001).",
        "It is reported that the 25 most frequent queries from the AltaVista cover 1.5% of the total query submissions, despite being only 0.00000016% of unique queries (Silverstein et al., 1999).",
        "As a result, the previous users' activities may serve as valuable information, and technologies focusing on common user information, such as collaborative filtering (or recommendation) may be a better resolution to web search.",
        "Therefore, the justification of utilizing individual user information deserves further discussion.",
        "To address this issue, this paper conducts a bilingual perspective of survey on two large-scale query logs publically available: the AOL in English and the Sogou in Chinese.",
        "First we quantitatively investigate the evidences for exploiting common user information and individual user information in these two logs.",
        "After that we introduce Kappa statistic to measure the consistency of users' implicit relevance judgment inferred from clicks.",
        "It is tentatively revealed that using individual user information is what requires web search to face with after common user information is well exploited.",
        "Finally, we study the distribution of potential for personalization over the whole logs to generally disclose what kind of query deserves for individual user information.",

        "With the rapid expansion of World Wide Web, it becomes more and more difficult to find relevant information through one-size-fits-all information retrieval service provided by classical search engines.",
        "Two kinds of user information are mainly used to enhance search engines: common user information and individual user information.",
        "We separately review the previous works focusing on using these two kinds of information.",
        "Among various attempts to improve the performance of search engine, collaborative web search is the one to take advantage of the repetition of users' behaviors, which we call common user information.",
        "Since there is no unified definition on collaborative web search, in this paper, we believe that the collaborative web search assumes that community search activities can provide valuable search knowledge, and sharing this knowledge facilitates improving traditional search engine results (Smyth, 2007).",
        "An important technique of collaborative web search is Collaborative Filtering (CF, also known as collaborative recommendation), in which, items are recommended to an active user based on historical co-occurrence data between users and items (Herlocker et al., 1999).",
        "A number of researchers have explored algorithms for collaborative filtering and the algorithms can be categorized into two classes: memory-based CF and model-based CF. Memory-based CF methods apply a nearest-neighbor-like scheme to predict a user's ratings based on the ratings given by like-minded users (Yu et al., 2004).",
        "The model-based approaches expand memory-based CF to build a descriptive model of group-based user preferences and use the model to predict the ratings.",
        "Examples of model-based approaches include clustering models (Kohrs et al., 1999) and aspect models (J.",
        "Canny, 2002).",
        "The other way to improve web search is personalized web search, focusing on learning the individual preferences instead of others' behaviors, which is called individual user information.",
        "Early works learn user profiles from the explicit description of users to filter search results (Chirita et al., 2005).",
        "However, most of users are not willing to provide explicit feedback on search results and describe their interests (Carroll et al., 1987).",
        "Therefore, recent researches on the personalized search focus on modeling user preference from different types of implicit data, such as query history (Speretta et al., 2005), browsing history (Sugiyama et al., immediate search context (Shen et al., 2005) and other personal information (Teevan et al., 2005).",
        "So far, there is still no proper comparison between the two solutions.",
        "It is still an open question which kind of information is more effective to build the web search model.",
        "Considering the difficulty in collecting private information, using individual user information seems less promising as the cost-effective solution to web search.",
        "To address this issue, some researches about the value of personalization have been conducted.",
        "Teevan et al.",
        "(2007) have done a ground breaking job to quantify the benefit for the search engines if search results were tailored to satisfy each user.",
        "The possible improvement by the personalized search, named potential for personalization, is measured by a gap between the relevance of individualized rankings and group ranking based on NDCG.",
        "However, it is less touched for the position of individual user information in contrast with common user information in large scale query log and how to balance the usage of common and individual information in information retrieval model.",
        "This paper tentatively examines individual user information against common user information on two large-scale search engine logs in following aspects: the evidence from clicks on the same query, Kappa statistic for the whole queries, and overall distribution of queries in terms of number of submissions and Kappa value.",
        "The bilingual statistics consistently reveals the tendency of using individual user information as an equally important issue as (if not more than) using common user information) issue for researches on web search.",
        "3 Quantitative Evidences for Using Common or Individual User Information",
        "To quantitatively investigate the value of common user information and individual user information in query log, we discriminate the evidence for using the two different types of user information as follows:",
        "(1) Evidence for using common user information: if there were multiple users who have exactly the same click sets on one query, we suppose those clicks sets, together with the query, as the evidence for exploiting common user information.",
        "It is clear that such queries are able to be better responded with other's search results.",
        "Note that common user information is hard to be clearly defined, in order to simplify the quantitative statistics we give a strict definition.",
        "Further analysis will be shown in following sections.",
        "(2) Evidence for using individual user information: if a user's click set on a query was not the same as any other's, for that query, the search intent of the user who issue that query can be better inferred from his/her individual information than common user information.",
        "We suppose this kind of clicks, together with the related queries, as the evidence for exploiting individual user information.",
        "Since users may have different search intents when they issue the same query, a query can be an evidence for using both common and individual user information.",
        "In our statistics, if a query has both duplicate click sets and unique click set, the query is not only counted by the first category but also the second category.",
        "The statistics of the two categories are conducted in the query log of both English and Chinese search engines.",
        "We use a subset of AOL Query Log from March 1, 2006 to May 31, 2006 and Sogou Query Log from March 1, 2007 to March 31, 2007.",
        "The basic statistics of AOL and Sogou log are shown in Table 1.",
        "Notice that the queries in raw AOL and Sogou log without clicks are removed in this study.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the statistics of different evidence categories over AOL and Sogou log.",
        "Note that click set refers to the set of clicks related to a query submission instead of a unique query.",
        "As for evidence for using common and individual user information, there is no clear distinction in terms of number of records, number of users in two logs.",
        "However, in terms of unique query and distinct click set, one can't fail to find that evidence for using individual user information clearly exceeds that for using common user information, especially in Sogou log.",
        "Therefore, though making use of common and individual user information can address equally well for half users and half visits to the search engine, the fact that much more unique queries and click sets actually claims the significance of needing individual user information to personalize web results.",
        "And methods exploiting individual user information provide a much more challenging task in terms of problem space, though one may argue utilizing common user information is much easier to attack.",

        "One is Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960), which measures only the degree of agreement between two raters.",
