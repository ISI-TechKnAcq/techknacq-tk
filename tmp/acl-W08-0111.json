        "A content plan consists of several assertions and the relations which hold between them.",
        "Content plans from the recommend strategy exclusively employ the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987) relation justify while those from compare-2 use contrast and elaboration.",

        "tion, the SPaRKy sentence plan generator adds the infer relation to assertions whose relations were not specified by the content planner.",
        "During the sentence planning phase, SPaRKy orders the clauses and combines them using randomly selected clause-combining operations.",
        "During this process, a clause-combining operation may insert 1 of 7 connectives according to the RST relation that holds between two discourse units (i.e. inserting since or because for a justify relation; and, however, on the other hand, while, or but for a contrast relation; or and for an infer relation).",
        "After each sentence plan is generated, it is realized by the RealPro surface realizer and the resulting realization is rated by two judges on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is highly preferred.",
        "These ratings are then averaged, producing a range of 9 possible ratings from {1, 1.5, 5}.",
        "From the ratings of the examples in Figure 1, we can see that some of the SPaRKy sentence plan realizations seem more natural than others.",
        "upon further analysis, we noticed that utterances containing many contrastive connectives seemed less preferred than those with fewer or no contrastive connectives.",
        "To quantify this observation, we calculated the average number of connectives (aveCi) used per realization with rating i, using aveCi = ToialCi /Nri, where ToialC.",
        "is the total number of connectives in realizations with rating i, and Nri is the number of realizations with rating i.",
        "We use Pearson's r to calculate each correlation (in each case, df = 7).",
        "For both compare strategies (represented in Figure 2(a) and 2(b)), we find a significant negative correlation for the average number of connectives used in realizations with a given rating (C2: r = -0.97, p < 0.01; and C3: r = -0.93, p < 0.01).",
        "These correlations indicate that judges' ratings decreased as the average frequency of the connectives increased.",
        "Further analysis of the individual correlations used in the comparative strategies show that there is a significant negative correlation for however (C2: r = -0.91, p < 0.01; and C3: r = -0.86, p < 0.01) and on the other hand (C2: r = -0.89, p < 0.01; and C3: r = -0.84, p < 0.01) in both compare strategies.",
        "In addition, in compare-3, the frequencies of while and but are also significantly and strongly negatively correlated with the judges' ratings (r = -0.86, p < 0.01 and r = -0.90, p < 0.01, respectively), though there is no such correlation between the use of these connectives and their ratings in compare-2.",
        "Added together, all the contrastive connectives show strong, significant negative correlations between their average frequencies and judges' ratings for both comparative strategies (C2: r = -0.93, p < 0.01; C3:r = -0.88, p < 0.01).",
        "Interestingly, unlike in the compare strategies, there is a positive correlation (r = 0.73, p > 0.05) between the judges' ratings and the average frequency of all connectives used in the recommend strategy (see Figure 2(c)).",
        "Since this strategy only uses and, since, and because and does not utilize any contrastive connectives, this gives further evidence that only contrastive connectives are dispreferred.",
