        "Previously, especially within the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) series of workshops (Dang, 2005; Dang, 2006; Dang and Owczarzak, 2008), multi-document summarization has covered aspects of summarization such as update summarization, guided summarization and cross-lingual summarization.",
        "In TAC 2011 the MultiLing Pilot (Giannakopoulos et al., 2011) was introduced: a combined community effort to present and promote multi-document summarization apporaches that are (fully or partly) language-neutral.",
        "To support this effort an organizing committee across more than six countries was assigned to create a multilingual corpus on news texts, covering seven different languages: Arabic, Czech, English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi.",

        "Furthermore, more texts were added to most existing corpus languages (with the exception of French and Hindi).",
        "In the following paragraphs we first overview theMultiLing tasks, for which the corpus was built (Section 2).",
        "We then describe the rationale and strategy applied for the corpus collection and creation (Section 3).",

        "There are two main tasks (and a single-document multilingual summarization pilot described in a separate paper) in MultiLing 2013: Summarization Task This MultiLing task aims to evaluate the application of (partially or fully) language-independent summarization algorithms on a variety of languages.",
        "Each system participating in the task was called to provide summaries for a range of different languages, based on corresponding corpora.",
        "In the MultiLing Pilot of 2011 the lan",

        "Participating systems were required to apply their methods to a minimum of two languages.",
        "The task was aiming at the real problem of summarizing news topics, parts of which may be described or may happen in different moments in time.",
        "We consider, similarly to MultiLing 2011(Giannakopoulos et al., 2011) that news topics can be seen as event sequences: Definition 1 An event sequence is a set of atomic (self-sufficient) event descriptions, sequenced in time, that share main actors, location of occurence or some other important factor.",
        "Event sequences may refer to topics such as a natural disaster, a crime investigation, a set of negotiations focused on a single political issue, a sports event.",

        "The output summary should be of the same language as its source documents.",

        "The first task was aiming at the real problem of summarizing news topics, parts of which may be described or happen in different moments in time.",
        "The implications of including multiple aspects of the same event, as well as time relations at a varying level (from consequtive days to years), are still difficult to tackle in a summarization context.",
        "Furthermore, the requirement for multilingual applicability of the methods, further accentuates the difficulty of the task.",
        "The second task, summarization evaluation has come to be a prominent research problem, based on the difficulty of the summary evaluation process.",
        "While commonly used methods build upon a few human summaries to be able to judge automatic summaries (e.g., (Lin, 2004; Hovy et al., 2005)), there also exist works on fully automatic evaluation of summaries, without human?model?",

        "An initial meeting was held to provide the basic guidelines and discuss questions on the translation process.",
        "Subsequently, email communication and periodic conferences were used to assign the next tasks, related to summarization and evaluation.",
