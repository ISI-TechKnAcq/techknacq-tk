        "Results for the Combined model suggest that the integration of distributional and WordNet-based methods can offer a viable solution to the coverage problem, as it achieves an accuracy comparable to the pure WordNet approaches, while keeping the coverage high.",
        "Figure 2: Dist-word model accuracy at different LU frequency cuts.",
        "Data Sparseness.",
        "A major issue when using distributional approaches is that words with low frequency tend to have a very sparse non-meaningful representation in the vector space.",
        "This highly impacts on the accuracy of the models.",
        "To measure the impact of data sparseness, we computed the accuracy at different frequency cuts - i.e. we exclude LUs below a given frequency threshold from centroid computation and evaluation.",
        "Figure 2 reports the results for best-10 assignment at different cuts, for the Dist-word model.",
        "As expected, accuracy improves by excluding infrequent LUs.",
        "Only at a frequency cut of 200 performance becomes stable, as statistical evidence is enough for a reliable prediction.",
        "Yet, in a real setting the improvement in accuracy implies a lower coverage, as the system would not classify LUs below the threshold.",
        "For example, by discarding LUs occurring less than 200 times in the corpus, we obtain a +0.12 improvement in accuracy, but the coverage decreases to 57%.",
        "However, uncovered LUs are also the most rare ones and their relevance in an application may be negligible.",
        "Lexical Semantics, Ambiguity and Plausible Assignments.",
        "The overall accuracies achieved by our methods are \"pessimistic\", in the sense that they should be intended as lower-bounds.",
        "Indeed, a qualitative analysis of erroneous predictions reveals that in many cases the frame assignments produced by the models are semantically plausible, even if they are considered incorrect in the leave-one-out test.",
        "Consider for example the LU guerrilla, assigned in FrameNet to the frame People by Vocation.",
        "Our mixed model proposes as two most similar frames Military and Terrorism, which could still be considered plausible assignment.",
        "The same holds for the LU caravan, for which the most similar frame is Vehicle, while in FrameNet the LU is assigned only to the frame Buildings.",
        "These cases are due to the low FrameNet coverage, i.e LUs are not fully annotated and they appear only in a subset of their potential frames.",
        "The real accuracy of our models is therefore expected to be higher.",

        "For 2 out of 5 words, no frame could be found for most of the sentences, suggesting that the most frequent frames for these words were missing from FrameNet.",
        "We can then conclude that 100% accuracy cannot be considered as the upper-bound of our experiment, as word usage in texts is not well reflected in the FrameNet modelling.",
        "Further experiments.",

        "These results confirm that WordNet-based approaches, while being highly accurate wrt distributional ones, present strong weaknesses as far as coverage is concerned.",
        "Furthermore, Johansson and Nugues (2007) show that their machine learning approach outperforms a simple approach based on WordNet similarity: thus, our results indirectly prove that our WordNet-based method is more effective than the application of the similarity measure presented in (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "We also compare our results to those reported by Burchardt and colleagues (2005) for Detour.",
        "Though the experimental setting is slightly different (LU assignment is done at the text-level), they use the same gold standard and leave-one-out technique, reporting a best-1 accuracy of 0.38 and a coverage of 87%.",
        "Our WordNet-based models significantly outperform Detour on best-1 accuracy, at the cost of lower coverage.",
        "Yet,our combined model is significantly better both on accuracy (+5%) and coverage (+8%).",
        "Also, in most cases Detour cannot predict more than one frame (best-1), while our accuracies can be improved by relaxing to any best-fc level."
