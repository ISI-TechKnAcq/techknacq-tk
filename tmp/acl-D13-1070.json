        "The publication boom of the last few years, especially in the life sciences, has highlighted the need to facilitate automatic access to the information content of articles.",
        "Researchers, curators, reviewers all need to process a continuously expanding flow of articles whether the purpose is to follow the state of the art, curate large knowledge bases or have a good working knowledge of their own and related disciplines to assess progress in research.",
        "While a lot of effort has concentrated on information extraction of particular types of entities and relations from the scientific literature (Cohen and Hersh, 2005; Kim et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011), with a view to support scientists in obtaining relevant information from scientific articles and abstracts, less work has focussed on automatically combining such information in the form of a cohesive summary which preserves the context.",
        "Researchers rely to a great extent on author-written abstracts, but the latter suffer from a number of problems; they are less structured, vary significantly in terms of length, are often not self-contained and have been written independently of the main document (Teufel, 2010, p.83).",
        "Teufel (2001; 2010), (Teufel and Moens, 2002) identify argumentative zones within scientific articles and use them to create use-targeted extractive summaries.",
        "Argumentative zones are annotations which designate the type of knowledge claim and rhetorical status for a sentence and how these relate to the communicative function of the entire paper.",
        "A selection of various combinations of argumentative zones are chosen for the use-targeted extractive summaries (rhetorical extracts), each of which ful-fills a different role.",
        "For instance, purpose-oriented extracts less than 10 sentences long are generated containing a predetermined number of AIM, SOLUTION and BACKGROUND zones.",
        "As the emphasis of this approach was the identification of the argumentative zones, less attention was given to the sentence selection criteria for the extractive summaries.",
        "The sentences chosen for the rhetorical extracts were either all sentences of a particular category (in the case of rare categories) (Teufel and Moens, 2002), selected according to a classifier trained on a relevance gold standard (Teufel and Moens, 2002), manually or randomly selected (Teufel, 2010, p.60).",
        "More recently Contractor et al. (2012) have used automatically annotated argumentative zones (Guo et al., 2011) to guide the creation of extractive summaries of scientific articles.",
        "Here argumentative zones are used as features for the summariser, along with verbs, tf-idf values and sentence location.",
        "They use a standard approach to summarisation, with a binary classification recognising candidate sentences which are then fed into a clustering mechanism.",
        "Extracts can be created to summarise the entire paper or focus on specific user-specified aspects.",
        "The number of sentences to include in the summary is pre-specified (either directly or using a compression ratio).",
        "Our approach also makes use of the scientific discourse for summarisation purposes.",
        "We use the scientific discourse to create a content model for extractive summarisation, with a focus on representing the content of the full paper, while keeping the cohesion of the narrative.",
        "We first automatically annotate the articles with a scheme which captures fine-grained aspects of the content and conceptual structure of the papers, namely the Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSC) scheme (Liakata et al., 2010; Liakata et al., 2012).",
        "The CoreSC scheme is ?uniquely suited to recovering common types of scientific arguments about hypotheses, explanations, and evidence?",
        "(White et al., 2011), which are not readily identifiable by other annotation schemes.",
        "Also, when compared to argumentative zoning and more specifically its extension for chemistry papers, AZ-II (Teufel et al., 2009), it was shown to provide a greater level of detail in terms of categories denoting objectives, methods and outcomes whereas AZ-II focusses on the attribution of knowledge claims and the relation with previous work (Liakata et al., 2010).",
        "We then use the distribution of CoreSC categories observed in abstracts to create a content model which provides a skeleton for extractive summaries.",
        "The reasoning behind this is to try to preserve cohesion within the summaries and we hypothesise that the sequence of CoreSC categories is a good proxy for cohesion (see section 3.1).",
        "In creating the summary, instantiating the content model, we identify independent categories and dependent categories, and we argue that in order to preserve the cohesion of the text the independent categories should be determined first (see section 3.2).",
        "We also preserve in the summary the distribution of CoreSC categories found in the corresponding full paper.",
        "Finally, we evaluate the extractive summaries in a complex real world question-answering task, in which we assess the usefulness of the summaries as well as to what extent the generated CoreSC summaries represent the content of the original article.",
        "Experts are presented with different types of summaries and are asked to answer article-specific questions on the basis of the summaries (see section 4.1).",
        "Our results show that automatically generated CoreSC summaries can answer 66% of complex questions with 75% precision, outperforming a baseline of microsoft autosummarise summaries (See section 4.2).",
        "We have also peformed an intrinsic evaluation of the summaries using ROUGE and automatic measures for summary informativeness, such as the Jensen-Shannon divergence, yielding positive results (See section 4.2).",
        "However, as such measures have not yet reached maturity and are harder to interpret, we consider the user-based evaluation to be a more reliable measure of summary quality.",

        "Our document content model is primarily based on the global discourse of the article as provided by the type and number of CoreSC categories.",
        "However, unlike (Teufel and Moens, 2002), who take a fixed number of AZ categories of specific type to create rhetorical extracts, the number of categories used from each CoreSC category depends on their distribution in the original article.",

        "Other methods include clustering based on sentence similarity and choosing the centroids (Erkan and Radev, 2004) or choosing the best connected sentences (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).",

        "Salience for sentence extraction in this case is determined by the need to select the most representative sentences for a category.",

        "To calculate these we define TP as matched answers, FN as N/A:justified and FP everything else (partially matched + un-matched:justified + un-matched:unjustified + N/A:unjustified).",
        "Here, the standard definition of recall (TP/(TP+FN)) demonstrates how many questions can be answered using the summary (summary coverage) and Precision (TP/(TP+FP)) how well the questions are answered (summary clarity).",
        "We consider the F-measure to be an overall indicator of the summary usefulness.",
        "Micro-averaging is obtained by adding all answers from all papers to calculate TP, FN and FP whereas macro-averaging calculates P-R-F first per paper and then averages over all papers.",
        "The rankings remain consistent regardless of the averaging method.",
        "Condition A (abstracts) shows perfect Recall (the evaluators are able to answer all the questions) whereas Precision is affected by unjustified failed matches (Table 2).",
        "The perfect recall is hardly surprising as the questions are designed on the basis of the abstract but provides a sanity check for the experiment.",
        "The precision sets an upper bound for precision with automatic summaries.",
        "Summaries of condition C provide answers to more questions (Recall) and with greater accuracy (Precision) than summaries B.",
        "When macro-averaging, the Recall score of summaries C is tied with that for summaries B but Precision is 6% higher.",
        "To verify the statistical significance for the difference in precision and recall for summaries B and C respectively, we performed Monte Carlo sampling 10000 times, for the populations of answers for summaries B and C. During each iteration of sampling, precision and recall were calculated, creating populations of 10000 recalls and 10000 precisions propagated to be representative of the original population of answers.",
        "A t-test performed on the population of precision and the population of recalls showed statistical significance at 95% in both cases, with summaries C having a precision of 5% higher and a recall of 1.4-1.6% higher than summaries B (see Table 4).",

        "However, this difference was less pronounced perhaps because autosummarize favours shorter sentences, which are more likely to be found in the abstracts.",
        "We expect that a refinement in the sentence selection criterion, which would also take sentence length into account, will help to showcase further the benefits of using a CoreSC-based content model.",
        "Analysis using ROUGE showed that while summaries C had a slightly higher ROUGE-1 measure than summaries B (0.75 vs 0.73), with respect to abstracts, ROUGE-L was the same for the two (0.70).",
        "In table 5 we also report measurements on summary informativeness based on divergence (Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence and Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence), as in (Louis and Nenkova, 2013).",
        "KL divergence is asymmetric and reflects the average number of bits wasted by coding samples of a distribution P using another distribution Q. JS divergence is an information-theoretic measure, reflecting the average distance of the KL divergence between summary and input (the full paper in our case) from the mean vocabulary distributions.",
        "Compared to other measures, JS divergence has been found to produce the best predictions of summary quality (Louis and Nenkova, 2013).",
        "In practice, what JS divergence tells us is how ?different?/divergent the summary is from the original paper.",

        "This is a positive outcome but since such automatic measures of summary quality have not yet reached maturity and are harder to interpret, we consider the manual evaluation a more reliable indicator of summary informativeness and usefulness.",
        "Note that it is not appropriate to use divergence to assess the abstracts as this measure is influenced by the length of a text, which varies dramatically in the case of abstracts."
