        "Most existing IR models score documents primarily based on various term statistics.",
        "In traditional models – from classic probabilistic models (Croft and Harper, 1979; Fuhr, 1992), through vector space models (Saltan et al., 1975; Narita and Ogawa, 2000), to well studied statistical language models (Ponte and Croft, 2000; Lafferty and Zhai, 2001) – these term statistics have been captured directly in the ranking formula.",
        "More recently, learning to rank approaches to IR (Friedman, 2002) have become prominent; in these frameworks, that aim at learning a ranking function from data, term statistics are often modeled as term matching features in a machine learning process.",
        "Traditional text matching features are mainly based on frequencies of n-grams of the user's query in a variety of document sections, such as the document title, body text, anchor text, and so on.",
        "Global information such as frequency of term or term group in the corpus may also be used, as well as its combination with local statistics - producing relative scores such as tf ■ idf or BM25 scores (Robertson et al., 1995).",
        "Matching may be restricted to certain window sizes to enforce proximity, or may be more lenient, allowing unordered sequences and nonconsecutive sequences for a higher recall.",
        "Even before machine learning was applied to IR, NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and parsing have been applied to both query modeling and document indexing (Smeaton and van Ri-jsbergen, 1988; Narita and Ogawa, 2000; Sparck-Jones, 1999).",
        "For example, statistical concept language models generalize classic n-gram models to concept n-gram model by enforcing query term proximity within each concept (Srikanth and Srihari, 2003).",
        "However, researchers have often reported limited gains or even decreased performance when applying NLP to IR (Voorhees, 1999).",
        "Typically, concepts detected through NLP techniques either in the query or in documents are used as proximity constraints for text matching (Sparck-Jones, 1999), ignoring the actual concept type.",
        "The machine learned approach to document ranking provides us with an opportunity to revisit the manner in which NLP information is used for ranking.",
        "Using knowledge gained from NLP application as features rather than heuristically allows us much greater flexibility in the amount and variability of information used - e.g., incorporating knowledge about the actual entity types.",
        "This has several benefits: first, entity types appearing in queries are an indicator of the user's intent.",
        "A query consisting of a business category and a location (e.g., hotels Palo Alto) appears to be",
        "Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 648-657, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009.",
        "©2009 ACL and AFNLP",
        "informational, and perhaps is best answered with a page containing a list of hotels in Palo Alto.",
        "Queries containing a business name and a location (e.g., Fuki Sushi Palo Alto) are more navigational in nature - for many users, the intent is finding the home page of a specific business.",
        "Similarly, entity types appearing in documents are an indicator of the document type.",
        "For example, if \"Palo Alto\" appears ten times in document's body text, it is more likely to be a local listing page than a home page.",
        "For the query hotels Palo Alto, a local listing page may be a good page, while for the query Fuki Sushi Palo Alto a listing page is not a good page.",
        "In addition, knowledge of the particular entities in queries allows us to incorporate external knowledge about these entities, such as entity-specific stopwords (\"inc.\" as in Yahoo Inc. or \"services\" as in kaiser medical service), and so on.",
        "Finally, even when using named entities only for deriving proximity-related features, we can benefit from applying different levels of proximity for different entities.",
        "For example, for entities like cities (e.g., \"River Side\"), the proximity requirement is fairly strict: we should not allow extra words between the original terms, and preserve their order.",
        "For other entities the proximity constraint can be relaxed – for example, for person names, due to the middle name convention: Hillary Clinton vs. Hillary R. Clinton.",
        "In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to modeling semantic features, incorporating concept types extracted from query analysis.",
        "Vertical attributes, such as city-state relationships, metropolitan definition, or idf scores from a domain specific corpus, are extracted for each concept type from vertical database.",
        "The vertical attributes, together with the concept attributes, are used to compose a set of semantic features for machine learning based IR models.",
        "A few machine learning techniques are discussed to further improve relevance for subclass of difficult queries such as queries containing multiple types of concepts.",
        "Figure 1 shows an overview of our approach; after discussing related work in Section 2, we spend Sections 3 to 5 of the paper describing the components of our system.",
        "We then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach both using general queries and with a set of \"difficult\" queries; our results show that the techniques are robust, and particularly effective for this type of queries.",

        "Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying entities, such as person names or locations, in text.",
        "The majority of state-of-the-art NER methods utilize a statistical approach, attempting to learn a mapping between a sequence of observations (words) and a sequence of tags (entity types).",
        "In these methods, the sequential nature of the data is often central to the model, as named entities tend to appear in particular context in text.",
        "For example, for most types of text, in the two sequences met with X and buy the Y, the likelihood of X being a person name is substantially higher than the corresponding likelihood of Y.",
        "Indeed, many named entity taggers perform well when applied to grammatical text with sufficient contexts, such as newswire text (Sang and Meulder, 2003).",
        "Web queries, however, tend to be short, with most queries consisting of 1-3 words, and lack context - posing a particular challenge for identifying named entities in them.",
        "Existing work on NER in web queries focuses on tailoring a solution for a particular entity type and its usage in web search (Wang et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2008); in contrast, we aim at identifying a large range of possible entities in web queries, and using a generic solution for all of them.",
        "In web queries, different entity types may benefit from different detection techniques.",
        "For example, an entity type with a large variability among instances as well as existence of external resources like product name calls for an approach that can make use of many features, such as a conditional random field; for entity types that are more structured like person names, a grammar-based approach can be more effective (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "To this end, we utilize multiple approaches for entity detection and combine them into a single, coherent \"interpretation\" of the query.",
        "Given a query, we use several entity recognizers in parallel, one for each of the common entity types found in web queries.",
        "The modeling types may differ between the recognizers: some are Markovian models, while others are just dictionary lookups; the accuracy of each recognizer is also different.",
        "We then have a machine-learned disambiguation module that combines output from different taggers, ranking the tagging sequences.",

        "Concretely, we exploit a set of features that attempts to capture proximity, general relevance, and vertical relevance for each type of semantic tag and for each section of the document.",
        "We now review these feature by their broad types.",
        "Proximity features – features that capture the degree to which search terms appear close to each other in a document – are among the most important feature sets in ranking functions.",
        "Traditional proximity features are typically designed for all query terms (Metzler and Croft, 2005) and may suffer from wrong segmentations of the query.",
        "For example, for the query New York city bus charter, a traditional proximity feature may treat \"city bus\" similarly to \"York city.\"",
        "But given detailed information about the entities in the query in their types, we can enforce proximity for \"New York city\" and \"bus charter\" more accurately.",
        "Different types of entities usually have different proximity characteristics in relevant documents.",
        "Strongly-bound entities such as city names typically have very high proximity in relevant documents, while entities such as business names may have much lower proximity: a search for Kaiser medical office, for example, may be well-served with documents referring to Kaiser Permanente medical office, and as we mentioned before, person names matches may also benefit from lenient proximity enforcement.",
        "This is naturally addressed by treating each entity type differently.",
        "We propose a set of semantic proximity features that associate each semantic tag type with generic proximity measures.",
        "We also consider tagging confidence together with term group proximity; we discuss these two approaches next.",

        "We extend this measure to Semantic Minimum Coverage (SMC) for each semantic type t in document section s and define it as where Wi is a weight for tagged term group i, MCi;S is the the minimum coverage of term group i in document section s, {k\\Tk = t} denotes the set of all concepts having type t, and |{fc|ïfc = t}\\ is the size of the set.",

        "As we mentioned in Section 1, we observe that term frequency in a database of business names provides an indication of the business brand, the key part of the business name phrase.",
        "While both \"yahoo\" and \"inc\" are very common terms on the web, in a database of businesses only \"inc\" is common enough to be considered a stopword in the context of business names.",
        "We propose a Vertical Moving Average BM25 (VMABM25) as a feature aiming at quantifying the vertical knowledge for web search.",
        "The basic idea here is to replace the idf score idf, of",
