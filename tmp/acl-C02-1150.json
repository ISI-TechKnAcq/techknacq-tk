        "Open-domain question answering (Lehnert, 1986; Harabagiu et al., 2001; Light et al., 2001) and story comprehension (Hirschman et al., 1999) have become important directions in natural language processing.",
        "Question answering is a retrieval task more challenging than common search engine tasks because its purpose is to find an accurate and concise answer to a question rather than a relevant document.",
        "The difficulty is more acute in tasks such as story comprehension in which the target text is less likely to overlap with the text in the questions.",
        "For this reason, advanced natural language techniques rather than simple key term extraction are needed.",
        "One of the important stages in this process is analyzing the question to a degree that allows determining the “type” of the sought after answer.",
        "In the TREC competition (Voorhees, 2000), participants are requested to build a system which, given a set of English questions, can automatically extract answers (a short phrase) of no more than 50 bytes from a 5-gigabyte document library.",
        "Participants have realized that locating an answer accurately hinges on first filtering out a wide range of candidates (Hovy et al., 2001; Ittycheriah et al., 2001) based on some categorization of answer types.",
        "This work develops a machine learning approach to question classification (QC) (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Hermjakob, 2001).",
        "Our goal is to categorize questions into different semantic classes that impose constraints on potential answers, so that they can be utilized in later stages of the question answering process.",
        "For example, when considering the question Q: What Canadian city has the largest population?, the hope is to classify this question as having answer type city, implying that only candidate answers that are cities need consideration.",
        "Based on the SNoW learning architecture, we develop a hierarchical classifier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answer types and is able to classify questions into fine-grained classes.",
        "We suggest that it is useful to consider this classification task as a multi-label classification and find that it is possible to achieve good classification results (over 90%) despite the fact that the number of different labels used is fairly large, 50.",
        "We observe that local features are not sufficient to support this accuracy, and that inducing semantic features is crucial for good performance.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2 presents the question classification problem; Sec. 3 discusses the learning issues involved in QC and presents our learning approach; Sec. 4 describes our experimental study."

        "The intension is that this classification, potentially with other constraints on the answer, will be used by a downstream process which selects a correct answer from among several candidates.",
        "A question classification module in a question answering system has two main requirements.",
        "First, it provides constraints on the answer types that allow further processing to precisely locate and verify the answer.",
        "Second, it provides information that downstream processes may use in determining answer selection strategies that may be answer type specific, rather than uniform.",
        "For example, given the question “Who was the first woman killed in the Vietnam War?” we do not want to test every noun phrase in a document to see whether it provides an answer.",
        "At the very least, we would like to know that the target of this question is a person, thereby reducing the space of possible answers significantly.",
        "The following examples, taken from the TREC 10 question collection, exhibit several aspects of this point.",
        "Q: What is a prism?",
        "Identifying that the target of this question is a definition, strategies that are specific for definitions (e.g., using predefined templates) may be useful.",
        "Similarly, in: Q: Why is the sun yellow?",
        "Identifying that this question asks for a reason, may lead to using a specific strategy for reasons.",
        "The above examples indicate that, given that different answer types may be searched using different strategies, a good classification module may help the question answering task.",
        "Moreover, determining the specific semantic type of the answer could also be beneficial in locating the answer and verifying it.",
        "For example, in the next two questions, knowing that the targets are a city or country will be more useful than just knowing that they are locations.",
        "Q: What Canadian city has the largest population?",
        "Q: Which country gave New York the Statue ofLiberty?",
        "However, confined by the huge amount of manual work needed for constructing a classifier for a complicated taxonomy of questions, most question answering systems can only perform a coarse classification for no more than 20 classes.",
        "As a result, existing approaches, as in (Singhal et al., 2000), have adopted a small set of simple answer entity types, which consisted of the classes: Person, Location, Organization, Date, Quantity, Duration, Lin-earMeasure.",
        "The rules used in the classification were of the following forms:",
        "– If a query starts with Who or Whom: type Person.",
        "– If a query starts with Where: type Location.",
        "– If a query contains Which or What, the head noun phrase determines the class, as for What X questions.",
        "While the rules used have large coverage and reasonable accuracy, they are not sufficient to support fine-grained classification.",
        "One difficulty in supporting fine-grained classification is the need to extract from the questions finer features that require syntactic and semantic analysis of questions, and possibly, many of them.",
        "The approach we adopted is a multilevel learning approach: some of our features rely on finer analysis of the questions that are outcomes of learned classifiers; the QC module then applies learning with these as input features."
