        "Various query languages for database access have been developed, among which unambiguous artificial ones are better adapted to computers.",
        "For man, on the other hand, it would be more convenient to communicate with computers in a natural language.",
        "The possibility of man-machine communication in a natural language has been one of the main concerns in the field of artificial intelligence, and considerable results have been obtained specifically in research into natural language access to a database.2.-8 These results, however, seem to be too complex and inflexible for practical application to general-purpose database systems.",
        "We will propose in this paper a \"natural-artificial hybrid\" language for database access.",
        "The global construction of a sentence in this language is highly schematic but allows expressions in the chosen language such as Japanese or English.",
        "A Japanese version of this language has been implemented for our compact database system SCLAMS8fl(SCaled LAttice Manipulation System).",
        "The main features of this implementation are:",
        "(1) Use of only a small lexicon and limited grammar so that they are quite easy to implement, and (2) Allowance of almost free form in writing Kana Japanese.",
        "Feature (1), which will be achieved also when using other languages like English, French, and so on, is one of the most noticeable merits obtained by using such a natural-artificial hybrid language for database access.",
        "We begin with an explanation of our basic logical unit of data, Scaled Lattice, or S.L.",
        "for short, since the proposed language is closely related to this unit.",
        "2.",
        "SML:Scaled lattice manipulation language 2.1 Scaled lattice as a data model What the normalization theory in the relational data model tells us can be stated very loosely as \"one fact in one place\".8 The concept of Scaled Lattice, or S.L.",
        "for short, also goes along this direction.",
        "Roughly speaking an S.L.",
        "is a multidimensional table, and is defined as a collection of data of one species arranged at multidimensional lattice points corresponding to the combinations of attribute values.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 shows a graphical image of S.L.",
        "which represents population data by year, prefecture, and sex.",
        "This is an example of three dimensional S.L's, which can be furthermore regarded as a mapping or a function with three variables in the mathematical sense.",
        "Let Sl, S2, and S3 be finite sets such as S1 ={ 1950, 1951, ... , 1980}, S2 =f Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, ...}, and S3 ={ male, female}.",
        "Also let A be an appropriate set having enough elements to represent values of population.",
        "Then the above S.L.",
        "can be naturally regarded as a mapping:",
        "which associates any triple (x, y, z) of attribute values in Sl x S2 x S3 with the corresponding population value F(x, y, z).",
        "Thus, for example, F (1980, Tokyo, male) denotes the male population of Tokyo in 1980.",
        "Generally an S.L.",
        "is a mapping F of the direct product of finite sets Sl, Sn into an appropriate set A denoted by",
        "These sets Sl, Sn and their elements will be sometimes called root words and leaf words respectively.",
        "The following are the advantages of this data model:",
        "(1) Data contained in an S.L.",
        "can be displayed exactly in the two-dimensional table form, which is visually very understandable.",
        "(2) In order to display data in table form, it is necessary to cut out an appropriate two-dimensional cross section from the S.L., or more precisely to select two appropriate scales on which the table is constructed, and, at the same time, to fix the remaining scales at some attribute values.",
        "This is nothing but a retrieval operation.",
        "Cutting out such a section is very easy, which means that certain retrieval operations are also easy.",
        "(3) Since an S.L.",
        "is regarded as a mapping, precise and powerful",
        "notations concerning \"sets and mappings\" are directly applicable for manipulation of the S.L.",
        "data.",
        "2.2 Brief outline of SCLAMS We have implemented a compact database system SCLAMS (Scaled lattice manipulation system), whose database consists of S.L.'s.6,7 SCLAMS has the following three major modes:",
        "(1) Storage mode: Storage of data as a set of S.L.'s editing from any file into the database.",
        "(2) Retrieval mode: Selection of one or more suitable S.L.'s from the database.",
        "(3) Manipulation mode: Data extraction from the above S.L.'s and some operation on the data.",
        "Thus, a retrieval operation according to a user's query is divided into two modes: Retrieval and Manipulation.",
        "Retrieval mode is similar to the document retrieval system, and Manipulation mode to the database system, in a narrow sense, regarding each S.L.",
        "as a small file.",
        "The main concern of our design of SCLAMS was to combine effectively these two modes, in other words, to integrate the function of document retrieval systems and that of database systems.",
        "2.3 Manipulation of scaled lattices by SML In this paper we will focus our attention exclusively on Manipulation mode of SCLAMS.",
        "The major function of this mode is to manipulate S.L.'s in a variety of ways such as extraction of data satisfying specified conditions, join of more than two S.L.'s data, elementary calculations for extracted data, etc.",
        "These operations are done through a query language for end users, named as SML (Scaled lattice Manipulation Language).",
        "We now show a few examples to illustrate some aspects of SML.",
        "Let Fl and F2 be two S.L.'s, i.e. two mappings such as",
        "A2 = Set of numbers of TV subscribers.",
        "These S.L.'s may be considered as an output of Retrieval mode.",
        "Each example below consists of an informal query and the corresponding formal one expressed by SML.",
        "Notice that the SML expressions contain the mathematical notations to describe sets and mappings.",
        "Example 1.",
        "List the male population of Tokyo in 1980.",
        "Example 2.",
        "List names and the number of prefectures in which the male population in 1980 is greater than one million.",
        "In this example B is defined as the set of prefecture X's with the population value F1(1920, X, male) > 1,000,000, and C as COUNT of B, where COUNT is one of aggregate functions prepared in SCLAMS.",
        "Example 3.",
        "List numbers of TV subscribers in 1980 of prefectures in which the female population in 1975 is less than one million.",
        "In this example two S.L.'s Fl and F2 are related by a common scale S2.",
        "General format of a query or a sentence by SML is shown in Fig. 2.",
        "In this format each of variables al,..., am is equal to one of those bl, bn; and the order of bl, bn is arbitrary.",
        "The types of expressions can be classified into the following six categories:",
        "1) Numeral or literal constants; e.g. 1980, Tokyo, male, etc.",
        "2) Aggregate function values; e.g. COUNT (x), SUM (y), etc.",
        "3) S.L.'s values; e.g. F(xl, xn), etc.",
        "4) Set operation formulas; e.g. x & y, xly, x-y, etc.",
        "5) Set definition formulas; e.g.",
        "<3, 5, 7, 11>, <Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka>, <xi:F(xl,...,xi,...,xn)<y>, etc.",
        "6) Abbreviate notations for elements of a scale, i.e. leaf words; e.g.",
        "S.1, S.11-20, etc.",
        "The latter, for example, represents from 11th to 20th elements of a scale S. It would be easily seen, from the above explanation, that a query by SML is expressed basically as a set of \"nonprocedural\" local queries, and thus the query as a whole has also of nonprocedural nature.",
        "3.",
        "Hybridization of SML with a natural language 3.1 An illustrative example",
        "We have assured that our query language SML is sufficiently flexible and has strong expressive power, specifically for those who are familiar",
        "with mathematical notations concerning sets and mappings.",
        "However, we can also say that SML is less convenient than a natural language which seems to be best suited for casual users.",
        "We therefore tried to hybridize SML with a natural language like English, Japanese, etc., believing that such a natural-artificial hybrid language should be one of the milestones to a realization of database systems wholly accessible via unrestricted natural languages.",
        "The next example, closely related to Example 2 in the last section, will show us how to hybridize SML with a natural language, say English.",
        "Example 4.",
        "List names and the number of prefectures in which the male population in 1980 is less than the female population of Tokyo in 1970.",
        "Now we consider the following two types of expressions for this query.",
        "(1) The global construction is quite similar to that of Type I expression, but it allows us to write phrases in the chosen natural language for definitions of variables such as A, B, and C. (If necessary, some of the variables may retain the original formal definitions.)",
        "(2) Notice that variable symbols such as A and C can be embedded in ordinary English phrases, so that the original query expressed as a",
        "complex sentence is divided into some simple queries.",
        "This contributes to readability of queries both for man and computer."
