        "ARIANE-78.4 is a computer system designed to offer an adequate environment for constructing machine translation programs, for running them, and for (humanly) revising the rough translations produced by the computer.",
        "ARIANE-78 has been operational at GETA for more than 4 years now.",
        "This paper refers to version 4.",
        "It has been used for a number of applications (russian and japanese, english to french and malay, Portuguese to english) and has constantly been amended to meet the needs of the users.",
        "Parts of this system have been presented before [2,3,7,8], but its whole has only been described in internal technical documents.",
        "This paper tries to give such a global presentation.",
        "Given the space constraint, it centers on the conversational environment under which users maj' manipulate the data bases of texts (with their partial transforms, their translations and their revision) and of linguistic programs (e.g. grammars and dictionaries), test and debug their programs, run complete translations and revise them.'",
        "Part I gives the necessary introduction to the system and its components.",
        "Each component (e.g. morphological analysis, structural analysis, etc.)",
        "is written is one of the four languages specialized for linguistic programming (LSLP) supported by the system (ATEF, ROBRA, TRANSF and SYGMOR).",
        "Those languages have been presented elsewhere.",
        "In part II, we explain the global queries and actions of ARIANE-78.",
        "Some global variables (such as the source language code) may be set.",
        "Various informations may be extracted from the data base, such as which texts have partial results for a given step of the translation process, or which are the lexical units for a given source (or target) language code, and in which grammars or dictionaries they appear.",
        "Some global actions, such as archiving part of a linguistic application, may also be performed.",
        "Part III and IV concern the subenvironments under which linguists may prepare the texts in different corpuses, by entering them directly, or reading them from input devices, as well as compose and compile the linguistic files.",
        "Part V describes some of the facilities supported for the interactive debugging of the different steps of an application.",
        "Last, but not least, Part VI presents 2 very powerful operators and the subenvironment for human revision.",
        "The first operator allows to compile a given application, partially or totally, by issuing one command and its parameters.",
        "Should an error occur in some file, the linguist may ' correct it, and the process will automatically continue the compilation.",
        "The second operator allows to use ARIANE-78 as a real operational system.",
        "In one command, the user may order all or some texts of a given corpus to be automatically translated by a given source-target language pair.",
        "We conclude by giving some estimates of the static and dynamic costs of the system (disk space, central memory, CPU times).",
        "I - THE SYSTEM AND ITS COMPONENTS The schema below shows the different steps of the translation process.",
        "The components of ARIANE-78 implementing the 4 different algorithmic models appear within circles, they are linked by double lines to the rectangles corresponding to the linguistic data written in the associated metalanguage for the indicated step.",
        "Simple arrows show the flow of control.",
        "UL means \"lexical unit\".",
        "The usual abbreviation for each step is given between parentheses (e.g. AS for multilevel analysis)."

        "- the space for the texts and the linguistic data.",
        "26 CH.",
        "BOITET, P. GUILLAUME and M. QUEZEL-AMBRUNAZ The space taken for a source text is just the size of the file containing it, and the same goes for its rough translation and its revision, if any.",

        "For any text and any language pair, up to 3 intermediate results may exist (after analysis, transfer, or syntactic generation).",
        "Obviously, the space taken by the texts does not measure the complexity or validity of an application.",

        "In the current russian-french application, for example, the source texts occupy roughly 12 Mbytes on disk.",

        "2 - Dynamic costs They may be measured in terms of the CPU time and the size of the virtual memory used while executing a translation, as this computation dominates the costs.",
        "A main principle of the implementation has been to use the virtual memory facility in such a way that, should the real memory be big enough, the only I/O incurred for executing a translation are due to loading the executable module generated by ARIANE, and reading/writing the input text, the intermediate results and the translation on disk files.",
        "In other terms, everything is done in central memory.",
        "For an application like the one mentioned above, a 2 Mbytes virtual memory is enough to contain the OS (CMS) of the virtual machine, the compiled tables, ARIANE's programs, and the work areas.",
        "As we said before, adding 1000 UL causes this size to augment by roughly 120K.",
        "As far as CPU times are concerned, only virtual CPU is significative.",
        "As it varies considerably from one type of machine to another, we prefer to give estimates in millions of (virtual) machine instructions necessary to translate one word, or Mi/w.",
        "If we consider various applications (russian-french, french-english, english-malay or english-chinese), this complexity lies between 3 and 7 Mi/w.",
        "According to the size and load of the computer system, a certain overhead (for simulation and paging) has to be added to obtain the total CPU time.",
