        "14.6%) and entity recognition errors (44?14.6%) are the main causes of wrongly predicted Binding events.",
        "The latter causes the event extraction mechanism to artificially produce single-argument Bindings instead of multiple-argument Bindings.",
        "We believe this issue can be resolved by broadening the scope of the entity recognition module to generic GGPs and chemical compounds, and reapplying the TEES algorithm to these entities as if they were normal GGPs as defined in the ST formalism.",
        "In contrast, edge detection errors are much more frequently the cause of a wrongly predicted Phosphorylation event (statistically significant difference with p < 0.05), caused by wrongly identifying the thematic object or the causality of the event.",
        "To resolve this issue, we propose future annotation efforts to specifically annotate the protein adding the phosphate group to the target protein as a separate class than the regulation of such a phosphorylation process by other cellular machineries and components (Kim et al., 2013).",
        "In conclusion, we have performed several statistical analyses and targeted manual evaluations on a large-scale event dataset.",
        "As a result, we were able to identify a set of rules to automatically delete or correct a number of false positive predictions (supplementary material at http://bioinformatics.",
        "psb.ugent.be/supplementary_data/ solan/bionlp13/).",
        "When applying these rules to the winning submission of the recent ST?13 (GE subchallenge), which was based on the TEES classifier (Hakala et al., 2013), 3 false positive predictions could be identified and removed.",
        "Even though this procedure only marginally improves the classification results (50.97% to 50.99% F-score), we believe the cleaning procedure to be crucial specifically for the credibility of any large-scale text mining application.",
        "For example, applied on the EVEX resource, it would ultimately result in the removal of 242,000 instances and a corrected event type of 230,000 more cases (1.2% of all EVEX events in total).",
        "These corrections will be implemented as part of the next big EVEX release.",
        "Additionally, the confidence score of more than 120,000 ambiguous cases could be automatically decreased.",
        "Alternatively, these cases could be the target of a large-scale re-annotation, for instance using the brat annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012).",
        "The resulting dataset could then serve as a new training set to enable active learning on top of existing event extraction approaches."
