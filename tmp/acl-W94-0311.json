        "Whether we talk of monolingual or multilingual generation, it is not surprising that there has been very little focus on the area of lexical choice.",
        "Lexical choice has often been side-stepped, not because it is a daunting issue, but rather because the interest in natural language generation (NLG) first focused on syntactic, morphological and discourse aspects of language.",
        "Semantic accuracy has been therefore sacrificed in the production of fluent grammatical sentences.",
        "In section 2, we highlight the issue of lexical choice, by arguing that generation systems must integrate lexical semantics and focusing on the treatment of Adjective-noun (Adj-Noun) collocations.",
        "We introduce the notion of \"semantic collocations\", which allows us to reduce the set of collocations which are usually listed in lexicons.",
        "In section 3, we present relevant aspects of the Generative Lexicon Theory (GLT), which, we argue, provides a better representation and interpretation of lexical information, enabling us to generate the set of possible semantic collocations in a predictive way without listing them in lexical entries.",
        "GLT is still under development from a theoretical point of view and up to now no generation system (as far as the authors are We would like to thank Susan Armstrong, Paul Buitelaar, Federica Busa, Dominique Estival, James Pustejovsky, Graham Russell and Scott Waterman for their helpful comments.",
        "aware) has tried to integrate or implement its ideas.",
        "We propose to do so, and are currently studying its theoretical adequacy for generation with special reference to the issue of lexical choice.",
        "In section 4, we show that it is possible to calculate Adj-Noun semantic collocations (a long book; an easy novel; a fast car) as opposed to the type of collocations where idiosyncrasy seems to be involved ( a large coke vs. a big coke).",
        "Finally, in section 5, we emphazise the adequacy of a framework such as GLT to generate the possible set of semantic collocations."

        "There is a debate in NLG concerning the place of lexical choice in the generation process.",
        "Should lexical choice take place at the level of the \"planning com-ponent\" or the \"realization component\"?",
        "Even for generators which do not have a \"traditional\" two-component architecture, actions are still sequential and lexical choice takes place after some \"planning\".",
        "Lexical choice relates to lexicalization in the sense of not only needing to pick up the right words or expressions but also of needing to \"realize\" them or lex-icalize them.",
        "We would argue on one hand that lexicalization does not constitute an autonomous module within the process of generation, and on the other hand that lexical choice is not the sole prerogative of either the \"planning\" or the \"realization\" component.",
        "The reason is that a concept cannot be seen in isolation (the choice of a particular concept will trigger some other related concepts) and when lexi-calized, the syntactico-semantics of the lexical item will impose some constraints on the further possible choice of concepts to be lexicalized (thus constraining the set of concepts triggered by the previous one).",
        "In other words in the process of production a lexical choice can influence a conceptual choice and vice versa.",
        "Thus in terms of NLG this means that lexical choice has some influence at the level of \"planning\" and \"re",
        "alization\".",
        "Moreover, if we want to generate in an incremental way, it follows that a strict distinction between these two components can no longer hold, and that we must attempt either to bridge gaps between them (Meteer 1992) or to generate in a partly parallel fashion.",
        "In this paper, we take the view of integrating lexical semantics in the design of the lexicon to be used in an NLG system, in order to perform the right lexicalizations.",
        "We define lexicalization as a complex dynamic process, by which we find the appropriate lexicalized items for utterances, in order to fulfill communicative goals.",
        "In fact, we think that we use a backward and forward process between concepts and lexical items and we believe that it is through incremental (re)lexicalizations(re)conceptualizations that we perform well-formed linguistic realizations (Viegas, 1993).",
        "In the following, after a brief overview of the issue of lexical choice, we focus on the treatment of collocations, which poses the problem of complex lexicalizations, and motivates the need of taking into account, in the process of lexicalizing, both several concepts and several lexical items."

        "Roughly speaking, the issue of lexical choice has been investigated mainly along two different lines: a conceptual-based approach (mainly in the Al tradition) and a linguistic-based approach.'",
        "Despite these efforts, lexical choice remains a burning issue.",
        "We agree with McKeown and Swartout (1988) when they say that: \"... a truly satisfactory theoretical approach for lexical choice has yet to be developed.\"",
        "However, like some leading researchers in generation, we argue that it is of paramount importance to first know the kind of information that should be coded in the lexicon, which means to pay more attention to \"the nature of words\" (McDonald, 1988) and to have a \"real knowledge of [the] lexical semantics\", as was pointed out by Marcus (1987): \"In some important sense, [the] systems have no real knowledge of lexical semantics .",
        "They use fragments of linguistic structure which eventually have words as their frontiers, but have little or no explicit knowledge of what these words mean.\"",
        "In this article, we will not give a review of the issue of the lexical choice; it is enough to say that the lexical semantic component for lexical representation is still 'Robin's report (1990) presents a good survey on \"Lexical Choice in NLG\".",

        "One can minimally define a collocation as the distribution of an object or element in relation to other objects or elements, as dictionaries do; needless to say, apart from remaining vague, at best this does not provide any clue for finding them operationally.",
        "â€¢ There are three main approaches to the study of collocations, namely, lexicographic, statistical and linguistic: in each of these, the term collocation is used differently.",
        "The traditional approach to collocations has been lexicographic.",
        "Here dictionaries provide information about what is unpredictable or idiosyncratic.",
        "Benson (1989) synthesizes Hausmann's studies on collocations (Hausmann, 1979), calling expressions such as commit murder, compile a dictionary, inflict a wound, etc.",
        "\"fixed combinations, recurrent combina-tions\" or \"collocations\".",
        "In Hausmann's terms a collocation is composed of two elements, a base (\"Basis\") and a collocate (\"Kollokator\"); the base is semantically autonomous whereas the collocate cannot be semantically interpreted in isolation.",
        "In other words the set of lexical collocates which can combine with a given base is not predictable and collocations must therefore be listed in dictionaries.",
        "In recent years, there has been a resurgence of statistical approaches applied to the study of natural languages.",
        "Sinclair (1991) states that \"a word which occurs in close proximity to a word under investigation is called a collocate of it ... Collocation is the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a text\".",
        "The problem is that with such a definition of collocations, even when improved, one identifies not only collocations but free-combining pairs frequently appearing together such as lawyer-client; doctor-hospital, as pointed out by Smadja (1993).",
        "There has been no real focus on collocations from a linguistic perspective.",
        "The lexicon has been broadly sacrificed by both English-speaking schools and continental European schools.",
        "The scientific agenda of the former has been largely dominated by syntactic issues until recently whereas the latter was more concerned with pragmatic aspects of natural languages.",

        "In this theory, lexical knowledge is encoded in an entry of the Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary, each entry being divided into three zones: the semantic zone (a semantic network representing the meaning of the entry in terms of more primitive words), the syntactic zone (the grammatical properties of the entry) and the lexical combinatorics zone (containing the values of the Lexical Functions (LFs))2.",
        "LFs are central to the study of collocations and can be defined as the following : a lexical function F is a correspondence which associates a lexical item L, called the key word of F, with a set of lexical items F(L) â€“ the value of F (Mel'Cuk, 1988).",
        "The LF Magn, for example, applies to different categories to deliver collocational values, expressing an intensity:",
        "The Melukian approach is very interesting as it provides a model of production well suited for generation with its different strata and also a lot of lexical-semantic information.",
        "It suffers nevertheless from three main problems (Heylen et al., 1993).",
        "First, all the collocational information must be listed in a static way, because the theory does not provide any predictable calculus of the possible expressions which can collocate with each other semantically.",
        "Second, it is sometimes difficult to assign the right lexical functions for newly analyzed lexical items; if we take the example of assigning an LF to an Adj-Noun structure, it involves knowing something about the semantic relation which exists between adjective and noun.",
        "(Bloksma et al., 1993) state that It is precisely this information which in many cases proves extremely difficult to establish, simply because it is just not entirely clear what semantic processes are involved in the union of adjective and noun\".",
        "Finally, sometimes LFs are too general to be useful, as shown in the following examples:",
        "In these cases, superscripts and subscripts are needed to restrict the scope of the LF: they enhance the precision of the LFs, making them sensitive to",
        "meaning aspects of the lexical items on which they operate, thus constraining overgeneration of multiple values; yet this also shows that the set of LFs described is not sufficient.",
        "By contrast, our general thesis is that there is no single definition for what a collocation is, but rather, collocational behavior emerges from a theory of what the range of connections and relations between lexical items can be.",
        "We claim that much of the allegedly idiosyncratic and language-specific collocation in language is in fact predictable from a sufficiently rich theory of lexical organization.",
        "This is not to say that there is no need for specific lexical encoding of some idioms and phrases, but that there is seldom any attempt made to bridge the gap between conventional semantic selection and the peripheral phenomena of collocations and fixed expressions.",
        "We will make the distinction between the following kinds of combinations:",
        "Idioms: (to kick the bucket; take advantage of).",
        "Formally, this takes us from purely compositional constructions of \"free-combining words\" to the non-compositional structures in idioms.",
        "The vast space between these two extremes can still be explained in terms of compositional principles with mechanisms from GLT such as type coercion and subselection (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1993), as we shall see below.",
        "Idiosyncrasies, of course, should be listed in the lexicon, yet we believe that we can reduce the set of what are conventionally considered idiosyncrasies by differentiating \"true\" idiosyncrasies (which cannot be derived or generated) from expressions which, since they are compositional in nature, behave predictably, and which we call semantic collocations."
