        "Automatic scoring of short text responses to educational assessment items is a challenging task, particularly because large amounts of labeled data (i.e., human-scored responses) may or may not be available due to the variety of possible questions and topics.",
        "As such, it seems desirable to integrate various approaches, making use of model answers from experts (e.g., to give higher scores to responses that are similar), prescored student responses (e.g., to learn direct associations between particular phrases and scores), etc.",
        "Here, we describe a system that uses stacking (Wolpert, 1992) and domain adaptation (Daumé III, 2007) to achieve this aim, allowing us to integrate item-specific n-gram features and more general text similarity measures (Heilman and Madnani, 2012).",

        "In this paper, we address the problem of automatically scoring short text responses to educational assessment items for measuring content knowledge.",
        "Many approaches can be and have been taken to this problem?e.g., Leacock and Chodorow (2003), Nielsen et al. (2008), inter alia.",
        "The effectiveness of any particular approach likely depends on the the availability of data (among other factors).",
        "For example, if thousands of prescored responses are avail-?System description papers for SemEval 2013 are required to have a team ID (e.g., ?ETS?)",
        "as a prefix.",
        "able, then a simple classifier using n-gram features may suffice.",
        "However, if only model answers (i.e., reference answers) or rubrics are available, more general semantic similarity measures (or even rule-based approaches) would be more effective.",
        "It seems likely that, in many cases, there will be model answers as well as a modest number of prescored responses available, as was the case for the Joint Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (?2).",
        "Therefore, we desire to incorporate both task-specific features, such as n-grams, as well as more general features such as the semantic similarity of the response to model answers.",
        "We also observe that some features may themselves require machine learning or tuning on data from the domain, in addition to any machine learning required for the overall system.",
        "In this paper, we describe a machine learning approach to short answer scoring that allows us to incorporate both item-specific and general features by using the domain adaptation technique of Daumé III (2007).",
        "In addition, the approach employs stacking (Wolpert, 1992) to support the integration of components that require tuning or machine learning."

        "ing different science domains: the Beetle dataset, which pertains to basic electricity and electronics (Dzikovska et al., 2010), and the Science Entailments corpus (SciEntsBank) (Nielsen et al., 2008), which covers a wider range of scientific topics.",
        "Responses were organized into five categories: correct, partially correct, contradictory, irrelevant, and non-domain.",
        "The SciEntsBank responses were converted to this format as described by Dzikovska et al. (2012).",
        "The Beetle training data had about 4,000 student answers to 47 questions.",

        "For each item, one or more model responses were provided by the task organizers.",
        "There were three different evaluation scenarios: ?unseen answers?, for scoring new answers to items represented in the training data; ?unseen questions?, for scoring answers to new items from domains represented in the training data; and ?unseen domains?, for scoring answers to items from new domains (only for SciEntsBank since Beetle focused on a single domain).",
        "Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro-average F1 scores, and weighted average F1 scores.",
