        "The Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is one of the most semantically rich English lexical databases that are widely used as a lexical knowledge resource in many research and development topics.",
        "The database is divided by part of speech into noun, verb, adjective and adverb, organized in sets of synonyms, called synset, each of which represents \"meaning\" of the word entry.",
        "Though WordNet was already used as a starting resource for developing many language WordNets, the construction of the WordNet for any languages can be varied according to the availability of the language resources.",
        "Some were developed from scratch, and some were developed from the combination of various existing lexical resources.",
        "Spanish and Catalan WordNets, for instance, are automatically constructed using hyponym relation, monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary and taxonomy (Atserias et al., 1997).",
        "Italian WordNet (Magnini et al., 1994) is semi-automatically constructed from definition in monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary, and WordNet glosses.",
        "Hungarian WordNet uses bilingual dictionary, monolingual explanatory dictionary, and Hungarian thesaurus in the construction (Proszeky et al., 2002), etc.",
        "This paper presents a new method particularly to facilitate the WordNet construction by using the existing resources having only English equivalents and the lexical synonyms.",
        "Our proposed criteria and algorithm for application are evaluated by implementing to Asian languages which occupy quite different language phenomena in terms of grammars and word unit.",
        "To evaluate our criteria and algorithm, we use the PWN version 2.1 containing 207,010 senses classified into adjective, adverb, verb, and noun.",
        "The basic building block is a \"synset\" which is essentially a context-sensitive grouping of synonyms which are linked by various types of relation such as hyponym, hypernymy, meronymy, antonym, attributes, and modification.",
        "Our approach is conducted to assign a synset to a lexical entry by considering its English equivalent and lexical synonyms.",
        "The degree of reliability of the assignment is defined in terms of confidence score (CS) based on our assumption of the membership of the English equivalent in the synset.",
        "A dictionary from different source is also a reliable source to increase the accuracy of the assignment because it can fulfill the thoroughness of the list of English equivalent and the lexical synonyms.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our criteria for synset assignment.",
        "Section 3 provides the results of the experiments and error analysis on Thai, Indonesian, and Mongolian.",
        "Section 4 evaluates the accuracy of the assignment result, and the effectiveness of the complimentary use of a dictionary from different sources.",
        "Section 5 shows a collaborative interface for revising the result of synset assignment.",
        "And Section 6 concludes our work."

        "Applying the nature of WordNet which introduces a set of synonyms to define the concept, we set up four criteria for assigning a synset to a lexical entry.",

        "The highest score, CS=4, is assigned to the synset that is evident to include more than one English equivalent of the lexical entry in question.",
        "On the contrary, the lowest score, CS=1, is assigned to any synset that occupies only one of the English equivalents of the lexical entry in question when multiple English equivalents exist.",

        "Both E0 and E1are included in a synset of S1.",
        "The criterion implies that both E0 and E1 are the synset for L0 which can be defined by a greater set of synonyms in S1.",

        "E0: aim E1: target",

        "S1: aim, object, objective, target",
        "In the above example, the synset, S1, is assigned to the lexical entry, L0, with CS=4.",
        "Case 2: Accept the synset that includes more than one English equivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry in question with confidence score of 3.",
        "In case that Case 1 fails in finding a synset that includes more than one English equivalent, the English equivalent of a synonym of the lexical entry is picked up to investigate.",

        "In this case the synset S1 is assigned to both L0 and L1 with CS=3.",
        "The score in this case is lower than the one assigned in Case 1 because the synonym of the English equivalent of the lexical entry is indirectly implied from the English equivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry.",

        "Figure 3.",
        "Synset assignment with SC=2 Figure 3 simulates the assignment of CS-2 when there is only one English equivalent and there is no synonym of the lexical entry.",
        "Though there is no any English equivalent to increase the reliability of the assignment, in the same time there is no synonym of the lexical entry to distort the relation.",
        "In this case, the only one English equivalent shows it uniqueness in the translation that can maintain a degree of the confidence.",
