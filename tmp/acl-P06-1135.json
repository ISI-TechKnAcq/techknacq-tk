        "Most QA systems nowadays consist of the following standard modules: QUESTION PROCESSING, to determine the bag of words for a query and the desired answer type (the type of the entity that will be offered as a candidate answer); SEARCH, which will use the query to extract a set of documents or passages from a corpus; and ANSWER SELECTION, which will analyze the returned documents or passages for instances of the answer type in the most favorable contexts.",
        "Each of these components implements a set of heuristics or hypotheses, as devised by their authors (cf. Clarke et al.",
        "2001, Chu-Carroll et al.",
        "2003).",
        "When we perform failure analysis on questions incorrectly answered by our system, we find that there are broadly speaking two kinds of failure.",
        "There are errors (we might call them bugs) on the implementation of the said heuristics: errors in tagging, parsing, named-entity recognition; omissions in synonym lists; missing patterns, and just plain programming errors.",
        "This class can be characterized by being fixable by identifying incorrect code and fixing it, or adding more items, either explicitly or through training.",
        "The other class of errors (what we might call unlucky) are at the boundaries of the heuristics; situations were the system did not do anything “wrong,” in the sense of bug, but circumstances conspired against finding the correct answer.",
        "Usually when unlucky errors occur, the system generates a reasonable query and an appropriate answer type, and at least one passage containing the right answer is returned.",
        "However, there may be returned passages that have a larger number of query terms and an incorrect answer of the right type, or the query terms might just be physically closer to the incorrect answer than to the correct one.",
        "ANSWER SELECTION modules typically work either by trying to prove the answer is correct (Moldovan & Rus, 2001) or by giving them a weight produced by summing a collection of heuristic features (Radev et al., 2000); in the latter case candidates having a larger number of matching query terms, even if they do not exactly match the context in the question, might generate a larger score than a correct passage with fewer matching terms.",
        "To be sure, unlucky errors are usually bugs when considered from the standpoint of a system with a more sophisticated heuristic, but any system at any point in time will have limits on what it tries to do; therefore the distinction is not absolute but is relative to a heuristic and system.",
        "It has been argued (Prager, 2002) that the success of a QA system is proportional to the impedance match between the question and the knowledge sources available.",
        "We argue here similarly.",
        "Moreover, we believe that this is true not only in terms of the correct answer, but the distracters,1 or incorrect answers too.",
        "In QA, an unlucky incorrect answer is not usually predictable in advance; it occurs because of a coincidence of terms and syntactic contexts that cause it to be preferred over the correct answer.",
        "It has no connection with the correct answer and is only returned because its enclosing passage so happens to exist in the same corpus as the correct answer context.",
        "This would lead us to believe that if a",
        "Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 1073–1080, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics different corpus containing the correct answer were to be processed, while there would be no guarantee that the correct answer would be found, it would be unlikely (i.e. very unlucky) if the same incorrect answer as before were returned.",
        "We have demonstrated elsewhere (Prager et al.",
        "2004b) how using multiple corpora can improve QA performance, but in this paper we achieve similar goals without using additional corpora.",
        "We note that factoid questions are usually about relations between entities, e.g. “What is the capital of France?”, where one of the arguments of the relationship is sought and the others given.",
        "We can invert the question by substituting the candidate answer back into the question, while making one of the given entities the so-called wh-word, thus “Of what country is Paris the capital?” We hypothesize that asking this question (and those formed from other candidate answers) will locate a largely different set of passages in the corpus than the first time around.",
        "As will be explained in Section 3, this can be used to decrease the confidence in the incorrect answers, and also increase it for the correct answer, so that the latter becomes the answer the system ultimately proposes.",
        "This work is part of a continuing program of demonstrating how meta-heuristics, using what might be called “collateral” information, can be used to constrain or adjust the results of the primary QA system.",
        "In the next Section we review related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe our algorithm in detail, and in Section 4 present evaluation results.",

        "1977).",
        "CHAT-80 (Warren & Pereira, 1982), for instance, was a DCG-based NL-query system about world geography, entirely in Prolog.",
        "In these systems, the NL question is transformed into a semantic form, which is then processed further.",
        "Their overall architecture and system operation is very different from today’s systems, however, primarily in that there was no text corpus to process.",
        "Inferencing is a core requirement of systems that participate in the current PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenge (see http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE and .../RTE2).",

        "The LCC system (Moldovan & Rus, 2001) uses a Logic Prover to establish the connection between a candidate answer passage and the question.",
        "Text terms are converted to logical forms, and the question is treated as a goal which is “proven”, with real-world knowledge being provided by Extended WordNet.",
        "The IBM system PIQUANT (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003) used Cyc (Lenat, 1995) in answer verification.",
        "Cyc can in some cases confirm or reject candidate answers based on its own store of instance information; in other cases, primarily of a numerical nature, Cyc can confirm whether candidates are within a reasonable range established for their subtype.",
        "At a more abstract level, the use of inversions discussed in this paper can be viewed as simply an example of finding support (or lack of it) for candidate answers.",
        "Many current systems (see, e.g. (Clarke et al., 2001; Prager et al.",
        "2004b)) employ redundancy as a significant feature of operation: if the same answer appears multiple times in an internal top-n list, whether from multiple sources or multiple algorithms/agents, it is given a confidence boost, which will affect whether and how it gets returned to the end-user.",
        "The work here is a continuation of previous work described in (Prager et al.",
        "2004a,b).",
        "In the former we demonstrated that for a certain kind of question, if the inverted question were given, we could improve the F-measure of accuracy on a question set by 75%.",
        "In this paper, by contrast, we do not manually provide the inverted question, and in the second evaluation presented here we do not restrict the question type."

        "We generated a set NELIST of the most frequently-occurring named-entity types in questions; this list is sorted in order of estimated cardinality.",

        "It was mentioned in Section 4.2 that certain questions were not invertible because no terms in them were of a recognizable type.",
        "Even when questions did have typed terms, if the types were very high-level then creating a meaningful inverted question was problematic.",
        "For example, for QA without Constraints it is not necessary to know the type of “MTV” in “When was MTV started?”, but if it is only known to be a Name then the inverted question “What <Name> was started in 1980?” could be too general to be effective."

        "The somewhat surprising condition that emerged from this effort was the need for a much more complete ability than had previously been recognized for the system to establish the equivalence of two terms.",
        "Redundancy has always played a large role in QA systems – the more occurrences of a candidate answer in retrieved passages the higher the answer’s score is made to be.",
        "Consequently, at the very least, a string-matching operation is needed for checking equivalence, but other techniques are used to varying degrees.",
        "It has long been known in IR that stemming or lem-matization is required for successful term matching, and in NLP applications such as QA, resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) are employed for checking synonym and hypernym relationships; Extended WordNet (Moldovan & Novischi, 2002) has been used to establish lexical chains between terms.",
        "However, the Constraints work reported here has highlighted the need for more extensive equivalence testing.",
        "In direct QA, when an ANSWER SELECTION module generates two (or more) equivalent correct answers to a question (e.g. “Ferdinand Marcos” vs. “President Marcos”; “French” vs. “France”), and fails to combine them, it is observed that as long as either one is in first place then the question is correct and might not attract more attention from developers.",
        "It is only when neither is initially in first place, but combining the scores of correct candidates boosts one to first place that the failure to merge them is relevant.",
        "However, in the context of our system, we are comparing the pivot term from the original question to the answers to the inverted questions, and failure here will directly impact validation and hence the usefulness of the entire approach.",
        "As a consequence, we have identified the need for a component whose sole purpose is to establish the equivalence, or generally the kind of relationship, between two terms.",
        "It is clear that the processing will be very type-dependent – for example, if two populations are being compared, then a numerical difference of 5% (say) might not be considered a difference at all; for “Where” questions, there are issues of granularity and physical proximity, and so on.",
        "More examples of this problem were given in (Prager et al.",
        "2004a).",
        "Moriceau (2006) reports a system that addresses part of this problem by trying to rationalize different but “similar” answers to the user, but does not extend to a general-purpose equivalence identifier."

        "We have extended earlier Constraints-based work through the method of question inversion.",
        "The approach uses our QA system recursively, by taking candidate answers and attempts to validate them through asking the inverted questions.",
        "The outcome",
        "is a re-ranking of the candidate answers, with the possible insertion of nil (no answer in corpus) as the top answer.",
        "While we believe the approach is general, and can work on any question and arbitrary candidate lists, due to training limitations we focused on two restricted evaluations.",
        "In the first we used a fixed question type, and showed that the error rate was reduced by 36% and 30% on two very different corpora.",
        "In the second evaluation we focused on questions whose direct answers were correct in the second position.",
        "43% of these questions were subsequently judged correct, at a cost of only 3.7% of originally correct questions.",
        "While in the future we would like to extend the Constraints process to the entire answer candidate list, we have shown that applying it only to the top two can be beneficial as long as the second-place answers are at least a tenth as numerous as first-place answers.",
        "We also showed that the application of Constraints can improve the system’s confidence in its answers.",
        "We have identified several areas where improvement to our system would make the Constraints process more effective, thus getting a double benefit.",
        "In particular we feel that much more attention should be paid to the problem of determining if two entities are the same (or “close enough”)."
