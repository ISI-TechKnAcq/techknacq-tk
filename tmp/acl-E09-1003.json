        "Parallel corpora have proved be an indispensable resource in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "A parallel corpus, also called bitext, consists in bilingual texts aligned at the sentence level.",
        "They have also proved to be useful in a range of natural language processing applications like automatic lexical acquisition, cross language information retrieval and annotation projection.",
        "Unfortunately, parallel corpora are a limited resource, with insufficient coverage of many language pairs and application domains of interest.",
        "The performance of an SMT system heavily depends on the parallel corpus used for training.",
        "Generally, more bitexts lead to better performance.",
        "Current resources of parallel corpora cover few language pairs and mostly come from one domain (proceedings of the Canadian or European Parliament, or of the United Nations).",
        "This becomes specifically problematic when SMT systems trained on such corpora are used for general translations, as the language jargon heavily used in these corpora is not appropriate for everyday life translations or translations in some other domain.",
        "One option to increase this scarce resource could be to produce more human translations, but this is a very expensive option, in terms of both time and money.",
        "In recent work less expensive but very productive methods of creating such sentence aligned bilingual corpora were proposed.",
        "These are based on generating \"parallel\" texts from already available \"almost parallel\" or \"not much parallel\" texts.",
        "The term \"comparable corpus\" is often used to define such texts.",
        "A comparable corpus is a collection of texts composed independently in the respective languages and combined on the basis of similarity of content (Yang and Li, 2003).",
        "The raw material for comparable documents is often easy to obtain but the alignment of individual documents is a challenging task (Oard, 1997).",
        "Multilingual news reporting agencies like AFP, Xinghua, Reuters, CNN, BBC etc.",
        "serve to be reliable producers of huge collections of such comparable corpora.",
        "Such texts are widely available from LDC, in particular the Gigaword corpora, or over the WEB for many languages and domains, e.g. Wikipedia.",
        "They often contain many sentences that are reasonable translations of each other, thus potential parallel sentences to be identified and extracted.",
        "There has been considerable amount of work on bilingual comparable corpora to learn word translations as well as discovering parallel sentences.",
        "Yang and Lee (2003) use an approach based on dynamic programming to identify potential parallel sentences in title pairs.",
        "Longest common sub sequence, edit operations and match-based score functions are subsequently used to determine confidence scores.",
        "Resnik and Smith (2003) propose their STRAND web-mining based system and show that their approach is able to find large numbers of similar document pairs.",

        "Bold parts are the extra tails at the end of the sentences which we automatically removed.",
        "include (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003), who use cross-language information retrieval techniques and dynamic programming to extract sentences from an English-Japanese comparable corpus.",
        "They identify similar article pairs, and then, treating these pairs as parallel texts, align their sentences on a sentence pair similarity score and use DP to find the least-cost alignment over the document pair.",
        "Fung and Cheung (2004) approach the problem by using a cosine similarity measure to match foreign and English documents.",
        "They work on \"very non-parallel corpora\".",
        "They then generate all possible sentence pairs and select the best ones based on a threshold on cosine similarity scores.",
        "Using the extracted sentences they learn a dictionary and iterate over with more sentence pairs.",
        "Recent work by Munteanu and Marcu (2005) uses a bilingual lexicon to translate some of the words of the source sentence.",
        "These translations are then used to query the database to find matching translations using information retrieval (IR) techniques.",
        "Candidate sentences are determined based on word overlap and the decision whether a sentence pair is parallel or not is performed by a maximum entropy classifier trained on parallel sentences.",
        "Bootstrapping is used and the size of the learned bilingual dictionary is increased over iterations to get better results.",
        "Our technique is similar to that of (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) but we bypass the need of the bilingual dictionary by using proper SMT translations and instead of a maximum entropy classifier we use simple measures like the word error rate (WER) and the translation error rate (TER) to decide whether sentences are parallel or not.",
        "Using the full SMT sentences, we get an added advantage of being able to detect one of the major errors of this technique, also identified by (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), i.e, the cases where the initial sentences are identical but the retrieved sentence has a tail of extra words at sentence end.",
        "We try to counter this problem as detailed in 4.1.",
        "We apply this technique to create a parallel corpus for the French/English language pair using the LDC Gigaword comparable corpus.",
        "We show that we achieve significant improvements in the BLEU score by adding our extracted corpus to the already available human-translated corpora.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we first describe the baseline SMT system trained on human-provided translations only.",
        "We then proceed by explaining our parallel sentence selection scheme and the post-processing.",

        "A sentence pair is selected for further processing if the length ratio is not more than 1.6.",

        "Sentence aligned parallel corpora are essential for any SMT system.",
        "The amount of in-domain parallel corpus available accounts for the quality of the translations.",
        "Not having enough or having no indomain corpus usually results in bad translations for that domain.",
        "This need for parallel corpora, has made the researchers employ new techniques and methods in an attempt to reduce the dire need of this crucial resource of the SMT systems.",
        "Our study also contributes in this regard by employing an SMT itselfand information retrieval techniques to produce additional parallel corpora from easily available comparable corpora.",
        "We use automatic translations of comparable corpus of one language (source) to find the corresponding parallel sentence from the comparable corpus in the other language (target).",
        "We only used a limited amount of human-provided bilingual resources.",
        "Starting with about a total 2.6M words of sentence aligned bilingual data and a bilingual dictionary, large amounts of monolingual data are translated.",
        "These translations are then employed to find the corresponding matching sentences in the target side corpus, using information retrieval methods.",
        "Simple filters are used to determine whether the retrieved sentences are parallel or not.",
        "By adding these retrieved parallel sentences to already available human translated parallel corpora we were able to improve the BLEU score on the test set by almost 2.5 points.",
        "Almost one point BLEU of this improvement was obtained by removing additional words at the end of the aligned sentences in the target language.",
        "Contrary to the previous approaches as in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) which used small amounts of in-domain parallel corpus as an initial resource, our system exploits the target language side of the comparable corpus to attain the same goal, thus the comparable corpus itself helps to better extract possible parallel sentences.",
        "The Gi-gaword comparable corpora were used in this paper, but the same approach can be extended to extract parallel sentences from huge amounts of corpora available on the web by identifying comparable articles using techniques such as (Yang and Li, 2003) and (Resnik and Y, 2003).",

        "Other probable sources of comparable corpora to be exploited include multilingual encyclopedias like Wikipedia, encyclopedia Encarta etc.",
        "There also exist domain specific comparable corpora (which are probably potentially parallel), like the documentations that are done in the national/regional language as well as English, or the translations of many English research papers in French or some other language used for academic proposes.",
        "We are currently working on several extensions of the procedure described in this paper.",
        "We will investigate whether the same findings hold for other tasks and language pairs, in particular translating from Arabic to English, and we will try to compare our approach with the work of Munteanu and Marcu (2005).",
        "The simple filters that we are currently using seem to be effective, but we will also test other criteria than the WER and TER.",
        "Finally, another interesting direction is to iterate the process.",
        "The extracted additional bitexts could be used to build an SMT system that is better optimized on the Gigaword corpus, to translate again all the sentence from French to English, to perform IR and the filtering and to extract new, potentially improved, parallel texts.",
        "Starting with some million words of bitexts, this process may allow to build at the end an SMT system that achieves the same performance than we obtained using about 40M words of human-translated bi-texts (news-commentary + Europarl)."
