        "A Graphical Model (GM) represents a factorization of a family of joint probability distributions over a set of random variables using a graph.",
        "The graph specifies conditional independence relationships between the variables, and parameters of the model are associated with each variable or group thereof.",
        "There are many types of graphical models.",
        "For example, Bayesian networks use an acyclic directed graph and their parameters are conditional probabilities of each variable given its parents.",
        "Various forms of GM and their conditional independence properties are defined in (Lauritzen, 1996).",
        "Our graphical representation, which we call Multi-dynamic Bayesian Networks (MDBNs) (Filali and Bilmes, 2006), is a generalization of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) (Dean and Kanazawa, 1988).",
        "DBNs are an appropriate representation for sequential (for example, temporal) stochastic processes, but can be very difficult to apply when dependencies have arbitrary timespan and the existence of random variables is contingent on the values of certain variables in the network.",
        "In (Filali and Bilmes, 2006), we discuss inference and learning in MDBNs.",
        "Here we focus on representation and the evaluation of our new implementation and framework.",
        "Below, we summarize key features underlying our framework.",
        "In section 3, we explain how these features apply to a specific MT model.",
        "• Multiple DBNs can be represented along with rules for how they are interconnected – the rule description lengths are fixed (they do not grow with the length of the DBNs).",
        "• Switching dependencies (Geiger and Hecker-man, 1996): a variable X is a switching parent of Y if X influences what type of dependencies Y has with respect to its other parents, e.g., an alignment variable in IBM Models 1 and 2 is switching.",
        "• Switching existence: A variable X is \"switching existence\" with respect to variable Y if the value of X determines whether Y exists.",
        "An example is a fertility variable in IBM Models 3 and above.",
        "• Constraints and aggregation: BN semantics can encode various types of constraints between groups of variables (Pearl, 1988).",
        "For example, in the construct A – B – C where B is observed, B can constrain A and C to be unequal.",
        "We extend those semantics to support a more efficient evaluation of constraints under some variable order conditions."

        "Model 3 is intricate enough to showcase some of the features of our graphical representation but not as complex as, and thus is easier to describe, than model 4.",
        "Our choice of representing IBM models is not because we believe they are state of the art MT models – although they are still widely used in producing alignments and as features in log-linear models – but because they provide a good initial testbed for our architecture.",
        "The topmost random variable (RV), I, is a hidden switching existence variable corresponding to the length of the English string.",
        "The box abutting I includes all the nodes whose existence depends on the value of I.",
        "In the figure, I = 3, thus resulting in three English words e1,e3, connected using a second-order Markov chain.",
        "To each English word ei corresponds a conditionally dependent fertility <<i, which indicates how many times ej is used by words in the French string.",
        "Each <<i in turn grants existence to a set of RVs under it.",
        "Given the fertilities (the figure depicts the case <(1 = 3,fa = 1,03 = 0), for each word ei, <<i French word RVs are granted existence and are denoted by the tablet Ti1, Ti2,..., ri^iof ei.",
        "The values of t variables need to match the actual observed French sequence /i,..., /m.",
        "This is represented as a shared constraint between all the /, n, and t variables which have incoming edges into the observed variable v. v's conditional probability table is such that it is one only when the associated constraint is satisfied.",
        "The variable is a switching dependency parent with respect to the constraint variable v and determines which /j participates in an equality constraint with Ti k.",
        "In the null word sub-model, the constraint that successive permutation variables be ordered is implemented using the observed child w of 7r0i and no(i+1).",
        "The probability of w being unity is one only when the constraint is satisfied and zero otherwise.",
        "The bottom variable m is a switching existence node (observed to be 6 in the figure) with corresponding French word sequence and alignment variables.",
        "The French sequence participates in the v constraint described above, while the alignment variables dj e {1,..., I}, j € 1,..., m constrain the fertilities to take their unique allowable values (for the given alignment).",
        "Alignments also restrict the domain of permutation variables, n, using the constraint variable x.",
        "Finally, the domain size of each dj has to lie in the interval [0,I] and that is enforced by the variable u.",

        "We test on the 2000 sentence test set used for the same evaluations.",
        "For comparison, we use the MT training program, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), the phrase-base decoder, Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003), and the word-based decoder, Rewrite (Germann, 2003).",
        "For inference we use a backtracking depth-first search inference method with memoization that extends Value Elimination (Bacchus et al., 2003).",
        "The same inference engine is used for both training and decoding.",
        "As an admissible heuristic for decoding, we compute, for each node V with Conditional Probability Table c, the largest value of c over all possible configurations of V and its parents (Filali and Bilmes, 2006).",

        "Table 1: BLEU scores on first 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 sentences (ordered from shortest to longest) of the ACL05 English-French 2000 sentence test set using a 700k sent train set.",
        "The last row is our MDBN system's simulation of a M-HMM model.",
        "Table 1 compares MT performance between (1) Pharaoh (which uses beam search), (2) our system, and (3) Rewrite (hill-climbing).",
        "(1) and (2) make use of a fixed lexical table learned using an M-HMM model specified using our tool, and neither uses minimum error rate training.",
        "(3) uses Model 4 parameters learned using GIZA++.",
        "This comparison is informative because Rewrite is a special purpose model 4 decoder and we would expect it to perform at least as well as decoders not written for a specific IBM model.",
        "Pharaoh is more general in that it only requires, as input, a lexical table from any given model.",
        "Our MDBN system is not tailored for the translation task.",
        "Pharaoh was able to decode the 2000 sentences of the test set in 5000s on a 3.2GHz machine; Rewrite took 84000s, and we allotted 400000s for our engine (200s per sentence).",
        "We attribute the difference in speed and BLEU score between our system and Pharaoh to the fact Value Elimination searches in a depth-first fashion over the space of partial configurations of RVs, while Pharaoh expands partial translation hypotheses in a best-first search manner.",
        "Thus, Pharaoh can take advantage of knowledge about the MT problem's hypothesis space while the GM is agnostic with respect to the structure of the problem – something that is desirable from our perspective since generality is a main concern of ours.",
        "Moreover, the MDBN's heuristic and caching of previously explored subtrees have not yet proven able to defray the cost, associated with depth-first search, of exploring subtrees that do not contain any \"good\" configurations.",
        "Table 2 shows BLEU scores of different MT models trained using our system.",
        "We decode using Pharaoh because the above speed difference in its favor allowed us to run more experiments and focus on the training aspect of different models.",

        "Table 2 also shows BLEU scores obtained by training equivalent IBM models using GIZA and the standard training regimen of initializing higher models with lower ones (we use the same schedules for our GM training, but only transfer lexical tables).",
        "The main observation is that GIZA-trained M-HMM, M3 and 4 have about 1% better BLEU scores than their corresponding MDBN versions.",
        "We attribute the difference in M3/4 scores to the fact we use a Viterbi-like training procedure (i.e., we consider a single configuration of the hidden variables in EM training) while GIZA uses pegging (Brown et al., 1993) to sum over a set of likely hidden variable configurations in EM.",
        "While these preliminary results do not show improved MT performance, nor would we expect them to since they are on simulated IBM models, we find very promising the fact that this general-purpose graphical model-based system produces competitive MT results on a computationally challenging task."
