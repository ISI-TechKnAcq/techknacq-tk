        "An argumentation strategy specifies what content should be included in the argument and how it should be arranged.",
        "This comprises several decisions: what represents supporting (or opposing) evidence for the main claim, where to position the main claim of the argument, what supporting (or opposing) evidence to include and how to order it, and how to order supporting and opposing evidence with respect to each other.",
        "Argumentation theory has developed guidelines specifying how these decisions can be effectively made (see (Mayberry and Golden 1996; Miller and Levine 1996; Corbett and Connors 1999; McGuire 1968) for details; see also (Marcu 1996) for an alternative discussion of some of the same guidelines).",
        "(a) What represents supporting (or opposing) evidence for a claim Guidelines for this decision vary depending on the argument type.",
        "Limiting our analysis to evaluative arguments, argumentation theory indicates that supporting and opposing evidence should be identified according to a model of the reader's values and preferences.",
        "For instance, the risk involved in a game can be used as evidence for why your reader should like the game, only if the reader likes risky situations.",
        "(b) Positioning the main claim - Claims are often presented up front, usually for the sake of clarity.",
        "Placing the claim early helps readers follow the line of reasoning.",
        "However, delaying the claim until the end of the argument can be effective, particularly when readers are likely to find the claim objectionable or emotionally shattering.",
        "(c) Selecting supporting (and opposing) evidence - Often an argument cannot mention all",
        "the available evidence, usually for the sake of brevity.",
        "Only strong evidence should be presented in detail, whereas weak evidence should be either briefly mentioned or omitted entirely.",
        "(d) Arranging/Ordering supporting evidence Typically the strongest support should be presented first, in order to get at least provisional agreement from the reader early on.",
        "If at all possible, at least one very effective piece of supporting evidence should be saved for the end .",
        "of the argument, in order to leave the reader with a final impression of the argument's strength.",
        "This guideline proposed in (Mayberry and Golden 1996) is a compromise between the climax and the anticlimax approaches discussed in (McGuire 1968).",

        "for dhis..xlecision: not to mention any counterarguments, to acknowledge them without directly refuting them, to acknowledge them and directly refuting them.",
        "Weak counterarguments may be omitted.",
        "Stronger counterarguments should be briefly acknowledged, because that shows the reader that you are aware of the issue's complexity; and it also contributes to the impression that you are reasonable and broad-minded.",
        "You may need to refute a counterargument once you have acknowledged it, if the reader agrees with a position substantially different from yours.",
        "Counterarguments should be ordered to minimize their effectiveness: strong ones should be placed in the middle, weak ones upfront and at the end.",
        "09 Ordering supporting and opposing evidence A preferred ordering between supporting and opposing evidence appears to depend on whether the reader is aware of the opposing evidence.",
        "If so, the preferred ordering is opposing before supporting, and the reverse otherwise.",
        "Although these guidelines provide useful information on the types of content to include in an evaluative argument and how to arrange it, the design of a computational argumentative strategy based on these guidelines requires that the concepts mentioned in the guidelines be formalized in a coherent computational framework.",
        "This includes: explicitly representing the reader's values and preferences (used in guideline a); operationally defining the term \"objectionable claim\" (used in guideline b) through a measure of the discrepancy between the reader's initial position and the argument's main clairn2; providing a measure of evidence strength (needed in guidelines c, d, and e); and An operational definition for \"emotionally shattering\" is outside the scope of this paper.",
