        "In our perspective, procedural texts range from apparently simple cooking recipes to large maintenance manuals.",

        "(Aouladomar et al., 2005).",
        "Procedural texts follow a number of structural criteria, whose realization may depend on the author's writing abilities, on the target user, and on traditions associated with a given domain.",

        "The work we report here was carried out on a development corpus of 1,700 French texts taken from the Web from most of the areas cited above, and extracted randomly from our more global corpus of 8,000 texts.",
        "We have developed a detailed analysis of procedural texts from a manual corpus analysis, identifying their main basic components as well as their global structure.",
        "For that purpose, we have defined two levels: a segmentation level that basically identifies structures considered as terminal structures (titles, instructions, prerequisites, connectors, etc.)",
        "and a grammar level that binds these terminal structures to give a global structure to procedural texts (Delpech et al.",
        "2008).",
        "This structure is textual and dedicated only to elements relevant to procedurality.",
        "To design the grammar, we have borrowed a few considerations from Minimalist syntax, in particular recent developments of X-bar syntax and notions like merge.",
        "This point will not be developed here (but see Delpech et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Note that text grammars are generally in a relatively early development stage (Webber 2004, Gardent 1997).",
        "Procedural texts are complex structures, they often exhibit a quite complex rational (the instructions) and 'irrational' structure which is mainly composed out of pieces of advice, conditions, preferences, evaluations, user stimulations, etc.",
        "They form what we call the explanation structure, which motivates and justifies the goal-instructions structure, viewed as the backbone of procedural texts.",
        "A number of these elements are forms of argumentation, they appear to be very useful, sometimes as important as instructions, they provide a strong and essential internal cohesion and coherence to procedural texts.",
        "An important aspect of this project is the accurate identification of the explanation structure as found in procedural texts in order to better understand explanation strategies deployed by humans in precise, concrete and operational situations and to transpose it to the generation of explanations in general and in cooperative question-answering systems in particular.",

        "Procedural texts have a very rich semantic structure, with a large number of facets.",
        "From our development corpus (1,700 web texts of 1-3 pages), we established a classification of the different forms explanations may take.",
        "The explanation structure is meant to guide the user in two ways: (1) by making sure that he will effectively realize actions as they are specified, via arguments (Amgoud et al.",
        "2001, 2005) such as threats, rewards, advice and warnings which are 'coercitive' in a certain sense, and (2) help considerations such as evaluation of work realized so far and encouragements of different kinds.",
        "The main structures we have identified in this type of text are facilitation and argumentation structures.",
        "They are either global (adjoined to goals, and having scope over the whole procedure) or local, included into instructional compounds, with a scope local to the instructional compound (see next section).",
        "The latter is by far the most frequently encountered case.",
        "Explanation structures can be organized as follows (the terminology is borrowed from existing work on rhetorical relations or introduced by ourselves):",
        "• facilitation structures, which are rhetorical in essence (Kosseim et al.",

        "In what follows, we will mainly concentrate on this second point, and in particular on warnings and advice which are the most frequently encountered arguments (since there are rarely involvements from the author).",
        "Roughly, we have about 25% of instructions which have arguments in do-it-yourself texts, and up to 60% in social procedural texts.",
        "Argumentation structures are relatively general to an application domain, while facilitation structures are much more specific to the text and the targeted audiences.",
        "In most types of texts, we do not just find sequences of simple instructions but more complex compounds composed of clusters of instructions, that exhibit a number of semantic contextual dependencies between each other, that we call instructional compounds.",
        "These compounds are organized around a few main instructions, to which a number of subordinate instructions, warnings, arguments, and explanations of various sorts may possibly be adjoined.",
        "All these elements are, in fact, essential in a compound for a good understanding of the procedure at stake.",
        "An instructional compound has a very rich, but relatively well organized, discourse structure, composed of several layers, which correspond to the different aspects instructions may have.",
        "The structure is the following:",
        "• The goal and justification level, which has in general wider scope over the remainder of the compound.",
        "It indicates motivations for doing actions that follow in the compound (e.g. You must regularly clean the curtains of your bedroom: to do this ... ; To change your mother card, you must... , which here motivates actions to undertake).",
        "It gives the fundamental motivation of the compound.",
        "Compared to titles, these introduce very local goals.",
        "These are not considered in the goal hierarchy introduced by titles, and they will not be considered for question answering.",
        "• The instruction core (or kernel) structure, which contains the main instructions.",
        "These are more or less explicitly temporally organized (see below).",
        "In general simple sequentiality prevails, the goal being to limit the intellectual load imposed to the user.",
        "Actions are identified most frequently via the presence of action verbs (in relation to the domain) in the imperative form, or in the infinitive form introduced by a modal (Delpech et al.",
        "2008).",
        "We observed also a number of subordinated instructions forms adjoined to the main instructions.",
        "These are in general organized within the compound by means of rhetorical relations, as the examples below will illustrate.",
        "• The deontic and illocutionary force structures: consist of marks that operate over instructions, outlining different parameters.",
        "These linguistic structures play a major role in argumentation:",
        "- deontic: obligatory, optional, forbidden or impossible, alternates (or),",
        "- illocutionary and related aspects: stresses the importance of actions: necessary, advised, recommended, to be avoided, etc.",
        "These marks are crucial to identify the weight of an argument.",
        "• a temporal structure that organizes sequences of instructions (and, at a higher level, instructional compounds).",
        "In general, the temporal structure is simple,",
        "sequentially prevails.",
        "In some cases, parallel actions are specified, which partially overlap.",
        "Action verbs may indicate some form of parallelism of actions (incorporate and stir).",
        "In other cases it is the user's experience that determines the exact temporal interpretation.",
        "• The conditional structure: introduces conditions over instructions within the compound or even over the whole instructional compound.",
        "We encounter quite a lot of structures organizing mutually exclusive cases Ifyou are pregant, take medicine Xif you are not pregnant and between 19 and 65, it is advised that you take medecine Y, ...",
        "• The rhetorical structure whose goal is to enrich the core instructions by means of a number of subordinated aspects (realized as propositions, possibly instructions) among which, most notably: enablement, basic forms of motivation, circumstance, elaboration, instrument, precaution, manner.",
        "A group of relations of particular interest in this paper are arguments, developed hereafter.",
        "• The causal structure indicating the goal of an action.",
        "We identified in procedural texts four types of causal relations, following (Talmy 2001): intend-to (direct objective of an action: push the button to start the engine), Instrumented (use a 2 inch key to dismount the door), Facilitation (enlarge the hole to better empty the tank) and Continue (keep the liquid warm till its color changes).",
        "These are local to a single instruction, with no a priori interaction with the goal or justification level advocated above.",
        "Explanations and arguments help the reader understand why an instruction must be followed and what are the risks or the drawbacks if he does not do it properly.",
        "We will illustrate this with two instructional compound examples.",

        "Some relations have a few marks associated whereas others are largely pragmatic and need some knowledge of the domain to be identified by a reader.",
        "We observed a few, partial, hierarchical relations between the items that build up an instructional compound.",
        "Scope priorities come in three groups.",
        "The first group is composed of goals and conditions, then, at a second level come causal, deontic and illucotionary elements operating over instructions.",
        "At the lower level, we have subordinated instructions, attached to the core instructions.",
        "The actual schema for recognizing instructional compounds is quite simple at the moment, but results are quite satisfactory.",
        "Basically, such a compound contains at least one instruction.",
        "It is then delimited as follows:",
        "• any element in an enumeration (typographically marked) is an instructional compound,",
        "• in a paragraph which is not an enumeration, an instructional compound is delimited by expressions which induce an idea of strong break (even though this term is quite fuzzy).",
        "Such marks are for example: goal or conditional expression, end of paragraph, strong temporal mark (after two hours, when this is over, at the end of, and so on).",
        "We have manually annotated 160 procedural texts.",
        "This is not an easy task due to the complexity of the structures at stake.",

        "2001).",

        "Neutral supports simply introduce explanations which are not arguments.",

        "At the moment, let's say that gains are a priori null, except when we have an instruction of type advice which is realized, in that case the gain is greater or equal to 1.",
        "Penalties are numbers greater than 0, high penalties corresponding to very crucial instructions.",

        "Gains and penalties do not compensate each other but operate at different levels.",

        "Considering do-it-yourself and gardening texts, we noted that about 2/3 of the arguments are not supported.",
        "This very large number of unsupported arguments, in such typically procedural texts, can be explained by several factors: (1) procedural texts are more oriented towards action than control, (2) some supports, possibly complex, could in fact introduce doubts or confusions, (3) some explanations (supports) may be too complex to be understood by a casual user, and (4) supports are sometimes sufficiently explicit in the conclusions (do not scatter seeds by high winds!",

        "In socially-oriented procedural texts, supports are often much more explicit, but this may differ depending on the author's style.",
        "We noted that realized supports correspond to two main trends: (1) supports that express general requirements such as: efficiency of actions, security, ease of execution, adequate execution, speed, aesthetics, lower cost, etc.",
        "and (2) supports that cover more precise, domain dependent situations (avoid pruning trees when temperature drops below zero).",

        "induced support: 'for a better ease of execution'.",
        "From our observations (which need further confirmation), generic supports are in general triggered by adjectives or by general purpose verbs used in the conclusion.",
        "The second situation (empty support in a domain dependent situation) is more delicate and requires domain or lexical knowledge.",
        "We are investigating the use of principles of the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1991) for that purpose.",

        "We analyzed the forms arguments of type advice and warning may take, and have implemented and tested a system that tags those structures and attempts at reconstructing empty supports.",
        "At this level, there is still linguistic and formal work to be carried out, for example to evaluate the illocutionary force of arguments and to better settle this work within action theory.",
        "We believe we have a very useful corpus of examples of arguments, of much interest for research in argumentation theory.",

        "Besides studying the textual structure of procedural texts and responding to How-to questions from the analysis of these texts, a major application of this work is the construction of domain know-how knowledge base, quite basic but which could be subject to interesting generalizations.",
        "Obviously, to make this knowledge optimal, it would be useful to associate with every statement a formal representation that supports inference, data fusion, etc.",
        "This domain know-how knowledge base of advice, hints and warnings is of much importance for different types of users who have a procedure to realize a task but who want to know more before starting.",
        "Some psychological experiments have shown that, besides instructions given in procedural texts, users are very much interested in what remains implicit in those texts: what you are supposed to know or care about (but have no means to ask).",
        "Although there are already available, but manually constructed, such bases of advice, it is of much interest to construct it automatically, using the instructional compound as an advice unit.",
