        "Parallel corpora are very valuable resources in various fields of multilingual natural language processing such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), cross-lingual IR (Chen and Nie, 2000), and construction of dictionary (Nagao, 1996).",
        "However, it is generally difficult to obtain parallel corpora of enough quantity and quality.",
        "There have only been a few varieties of parallel corpora.",
        "In addition, their languages have been biased toward English–French and their contents toward official documents of governmental institutions or software manuals.",
        "Therefore, it is often difficult to find a parallel corpus that meets the needs of specific researches.",
        "To solve this problem, approaches to collect parallel texts from the Web have been proposed.",
        "In the Web space, all sorts of languages are used though English is dominating, and the content of the texts seems to be as diverse as all activities of the human-beings.",
        "Therefore, this approach has a potential to break the limitation in the use of parallel corpora.",
        "Previous works successfully built parallel corpora of interesting sizes.",
        "Most of them utilized URL strings or HTML tags as a clue to efficiently find parallel documents (Yang and Li, 2002; Nadeau and Foster, 2004).",
        "Depending on such information specific to webpages limits the applicability of the methods.",
        "Even for webpages, many parallel texts not conforming to the presupposed styles will be left undetected.",
        "In this work, we have therefore decided to focus on a generally applicable method, which is solely based on the textual content of the documents.",
        "The main challenge then is how to make judgements fast.",
        "Our proposed method utilizes a bilingual dictionary which, for each word in tne language, gives the list of translations in the other.",

        "With this method, we achieved 250,000 pairs/sec throughput on a single Xeon CPU (2.4GHz).",
