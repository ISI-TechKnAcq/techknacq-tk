        "With the rise of social media, researchers have sought to induce models for predicting latent author attributes such as gender, age, and political preferences (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Van Durme, 2012b; Zamal et al., 2012).",
        "Such models are clearly in line with the goals of both computational advertising (Wortman, 2008) and the growing area of computational social science (Conover et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011; Paul and Dredze, 2011; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Moham-mad et al., 2013) where big data and computation supplement methods based on, e.g., direct human surveys.",
        "For example, Eisenstein et al. (2010) demonstrated a model that predicted where an author was located in order to analyze regional distinctions in communication.",
        "While some users explicitly share their GPS coordinates through their Twitter clients, having a larger collection of automatically identified users within a region was preferable even though the predictions for any given user were uncertain.",
        "We show that media such as Twitter can support classification that is more fine-grained than gender or general location.",
        "Predicting social roles such as doctor, teacher, vegetarian, christian, may open the door to large-scale passive surveys of public discourse that dwarf what has been previously available to social scientists.",
        "For exam-ple, work on tracking the spread of flu infections across Twitter (Lamb et al., 2013) might be enhanced with a factor based on aggregate predictions of author occupation.",
        "We present two studies showing that first-person social content (tweets) contains intuitive signals for such fine-grained roles.",
        "We argue that non-trivial classifiers may be constructed based purely on leveraging simple linguistic patterns.",
        "These baselines suggest a wide range of author categories to be explored further in future work.",
        "Study 1 In the first study, we seek to determine whether such a signal exists in self-identification: we rely on variants of a single pattern, ?I am a ?, to bootstrap data for training balanced-class binary classifiers using unigrams observed in tweet content.",
        "As compared to prior research that required actively polling users for ground truth in order to construct predictive models for demographic information (Kosinski et al., 2013), we demonstrate that some users specify such properties publicly through direct natural language.",
        "Many of the resultant models show intuitive strongly-weighted features, such as a writer being likely to tweet about a story, or an athlete discussing a game.",
        "This demonstrates self-identification as a viable signal in building predictive models of social roles.",

        "We identify typical attributes of a given social role by collecting terms in the Google n-gram corpus that occur frequently in a possessive construction with that role.",
        "For example, with the role doctor we extract terms matching the simple pattern ?doctor's ?.",
        "2 Self-identification All role-representative users were drawn from the free public 1% sample of the Twitter Fire-hose, over the period 2011-2013, from the subset that selected English as their native language (85,387,204 unique users).",
        "To identify users of a particular role, we performed a case-agnostic search of variants of a single pattern: I am a(n) , and I?m a(n) , where all single tokens filling the slot were taken as evidence of the author self-reporting for the given ?role?.",
        "Example tweets can be seen in Table 1, examples of frequency per role in Table 2.",

        "As a hint of the sort of user studies one might explore given access to social role prediction, we see in Figure 1 a correlation between self-reported role and the chance of an account still being publicly visible, with roles such as belieber and directioner on the one hand, and doctor and teacher on the other.",
        "The authors examined the self-identifying tweet of 20 random users per role.",

        "To explore whether language provides signal for future work in fine-grain social role prediction, we constructed a set of ex-periments, one per role, where training and test sets were balanced between users from a random background sample and self-reported users.",
        "Baseline accuracy in these experiments was thus 50%.",
        "Each training set had a target of 600 users (300 background, 300 self-identified); for those roles with less than 300 users self-identifying, all users were used, with an equal number background.",

        "Training and testing was done with a log-linear model via LibLinear (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "We used the positively annotated data to form test sets, balanced with data from the background set.",
        "Each test set had a theoretical maximum size of 40, but for several classes it was in the single digits (see Figure 2).",

        "If one views a role, in their case gender, as two conceptual classes, male and female, then existing attribute extraction methods for third-person content (e.g., news articles) can be cheaply used to create a set of bootstrapping features for building classifiers over first-person content (e.g., tweets).",
        "For example, if we learn from news corpora that: a man may have a wife, then a tweet saying: ...my wife... can be taken as potential evidence of membership in the male conceptual class.",
        "In our second study, we test whether this idea extends to our wider set of fine-grained roles.",
        "For example, we aimed to discover that a doctor may have a patient, while a hairdresser may have a salon; these properties can be expressed in first-person content as possessives like my patient or my salon.",
        "We approached this task by selecting target roles from the first experiment and ranking characteristic attributes for each using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990).",
        "First, we counted all terms matching a target social role's possessive pattern (e.g., doctor's ) in the web-scale n-gram corpus Google V2 (Lin et al., 2010) 5 .",
        "We ranked the collected terms by computing PMI between classes and attribute terms.",
        "Probabilities were estimated from counts of the class-attribute pairs along with counts matching the generic possessive patterns his and her which serve as general background categories.",
        "Following suggestions by Bergsma and Van Durme, we manually filtered the ranked list.",
        "6 We removed attributes that were either (a) not nominal, or (b) not indicative of the social role.",
        "This left fewer than 30 attribute terms per role, with many roles having fewer than 10.",
        "We next performed a precision test to identify potentially useful attributes in these lists.",
        "We examined tweets with a first person possessive pattern for each attribute term from a small corpus of tweets collected over a single month in 2013, discarding those attribute terms with no positive matches.",
        "This precision test is useful regardless of how attribute lists are generated.",
        "The attribute 5 In this corpus, follower-type roles like belieber and directioner are not at all prevalent.",
        "We therefore focused on occupational and habitual roles (e.g., doctor, smoker).",
        "6 Evidence from cognitive work on memory-dependent tasks suggests that such relevance based filtering (recogni- tion) involves less cognitive effort than generating relevant attributes (recall) see (Jacoby et al., 1979).",
        "Indeed, this filtering step generally took less than a minute per class.",
        "term chart, for example, had high PMI with doc-tor; but a precision test on the phrase my chart yielded a single tweet which referred not to a medical chart but to a top ten list (prompting removal of this attribute).",
        "Using this smaller high-precision set of attribute terms, we collected tweets from the Twitter Firehose over the period 2011-2013.",
        "4 Attribute-based Classification Attribute terms are less indicative overall than self-ID, e.g., the phrase I?m a barber is a clearer signal than my scissors.",
        "We therefore include a role verification step in curating a collection of positively identified users.",
        "We use the crowd-sourcing platform Mechanical Turk 7 to judge whether the person tweeting held a given role Tweets were judged 5-way redundantly.",
        "Mechanical Turk judges (?Turkers?)",

        "We piloted this labeling task on 10 tweets per attribute term over a variety of classes.",
        "Each answer was associated with a score (Yes = 1, Maybe = .5, Hard to tell = No = 0) and aggregated across the five judges.",
        "We found in development that an aggregate score of 4.0 (out of 5.0) led to an acceptable agreement rate between the Turkers and the experimenters, when the tweets were randomly sampled and judged internally.",
        "We found that making conceptual class assignments based on a single tweet was often a subtle task.",
        "The results of this labeling study are shown in Figure 4, which gives the percent of tweets per attribute that were 4.0 or above.",
        "Attribute terms shown in red were manually discarded as being inaccurate (low on the y-axis) or non-prevalent (small shape).",
