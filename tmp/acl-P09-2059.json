        "Phrase-based SMT models have performed reasonably well on languages where the syntactic structures are very similar, including languages such as French and English.",
        "However, Collins et al.",
        "(2005) demonstrated that phrase-based models have limited potential when applied to languages that have a relatively different word order; such is the case between German and English.",
        "They proposed a clause restructuring method for reordering German sentences in order to resemble the order of English sentences.",
        "By modifying the source sentence structure into the target sentence structure, they argued that they could solve the decoding problem by use of completely monotonic translation.",
        "The translation from English to Korean can be more difficult than the translation of other language pairs for the following reasons: First, Korean is language isolate: that is, it has little genealogical relations with other natural languages.",
        "Second, the word order in Korean is relatively free because the functional morphemes, case particles and word endings, play the role as a grammatical information marker.",
        "Thus, the functional morphemes, rather than the word order, determine whether a word is a subject or an object.",
        "Third, Korean is an agglutinative language, in which a word is generally composed of at least one content morpheme and zero or more functional morphemes.",
        "Some Korean words are highly synthetic with complex inflections, and this phenomenon produces a very large vocabulary and causes data-sparseness in performing word-based alignment.",
        "To mitigate this problem, many systems tokenize Korean sentences by the morpheme unit before training and decoding the sentences.",
        "When analyzing English-Korean translation with MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007), we found high ratio of null alignment.",
        "In figure 1, '£(<?««)', cS](eui)\\ imha)\\l\\-(ri)\\ e*l(/z)' and '^^(neundaY are not linked to any word in the English sentence.",
        "In many cases, these words are function words that are attached to preceding content words.",
        "Sometimes they can be linked (incorrectly) to their head's corresponding words, or they can be linked to totally different words with respect to their meaning.",
        "In the preliminary experiment using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with grow-diag-final heuristic, we found that about 25% of words in Korean sentences and 21% of English sentences fail to align.",
        "This null alignment ratio is relatively high in comparison to the French-English alignment, in which about 9% of French sentences and 6% of English sentences are not aligned.",
        "Due to this null alignment, the estimation of translation probabilities for Korean function words may be incomplete; a system would perform mainly based",

        "on content-words, which can deteriorate the performance of candidate generation during decoding.",
        "Also, without generating appropriate function words, the quality of the translation will undoubtedly degrade.",
        "In this paper, we present a preprocessing method for both training and decoding in English-Korean SMT.",
        "In particular, we transform a source language sentence by inserting pseudo words and syntactically reordering it to form a target sentence structure in hopes of reducing the morpho-syntactic discrepancies between two languages.",
        "Ultimately, we expect an ideal alignment, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Our results show that the combined pseudo word insertion and syntactic reordering method reduces null alignment ratio and makes both sentences have similar length.",
        "We report results showing that the proposed method can improve the translation quality."

        "Lee et al.",
        "(2006) find that function words in Korean sentences are not aligned to any English words, and can simply and easily be removed by referring to their POS information.",
        "The unaligned words are case particles, final endings, and auxiliary particles, and they call these words \"untranslatable words\".",
        "The method can be effective for Korean-English SMT where target language does not have corresponding function words, but it has a limitation in application to the English-Korean SMT because removing functional morphemes can cause a serious loss in information.",
        "Technically, the function words they ignored are not 'untranslatable' but are 'unalignable'.",
        "Therefore, instead of removing the function words, we decide to insert some pseudo words into an English sentence in order to align them with potential Korean function words and make the length of both sentences similar.",
        "To insert the pseudo words, we need to decide: (1) the kinds of words to insert, and (2) the location to insert the words.",
        "Because we expect that a pseudo word corresponds to any Korean function word which decides a syntactic role of its head, it is reasonable to utilize a dependency relation of English.",
        "Thus, given an English sentence, the candidate pseudo words are generated by the following methods: First, we parse the English sentence using Stanford dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "Then, we select appropriate typed dependency relations between pairs of words which are able to generate Korean function words.",
        "We found that 21 out of 48 dependency relations can be directly used as pseudo words.",
        "Among them, some relations provide very strong cue of case particles when inserted as pseudo words.",
        "For example, from the following sentence, we can select as pseudo words a subjective particle <NS> and an objective particle <DO>, and insert them after the corresponding dependents Eugene and guitar respectively.",
        "nominal_subject(play, Eugene) direct_object(play, guitar)",
        "Eugene <NS> can't play the guitar <DO> well .",
        "In a preliminary experiment on word alignment,",
        "Figure 3: Selected dependency relations and their aligned function words in training data (shown the top 3 results in descending order of alignment probability) we observe that inserting too many pseudo words can, on the contrary, increase null alignment of English sentence.",
        "Thus we filtered some pseudo words according to their respective null alignment probabilities.",

        "(2006) reported that the reordering of Korean for Korean-English translation degraded the performance.",
        "They presumed that the performance decrease might come from low parsing performance for conversational domain.",
        "We believe that it is very important to consider the structural properties of Korean for reordering English sentences.",
        "Though the word order of a Korean sentence is relatively free, Korean generally observes the SOV word order, and it is a head-final language.",
        "Consequently, an object precedes a predicate, and all dependents precede their heads.",
        "We use both a structured parse tree and dependency relations to extract following reordering rules.",
