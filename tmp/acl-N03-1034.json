        "Evaluating competing technologies on a common problem set is a powerful way to improve the state of the art and hasten technology transfer.",
        "Yet poorly designed evaluations can waste research effort or even mislead researchers with faulty conclusions.",
        "Thus it is important to examine the quality of a new evaluation task to establish its reliability.",
        "This paper provides an example of one such assessment by analyzing the task within the TREC 2002 question answering track.",
        "The analysis demonstrates that comparative results from the new task are stable, and empirically estimates the size of the difference required between scores to confidently conclude that two runs are different.",
        "Metric-based evaluations of human language technology such as MUC and TREC and DUC continue to proliferate (Sparck Jones, 2001).",
        "This proliferation is not difficult to understand: evaluations can forge communities, accelerate technology transfer, and advance the state of the art.",
        "Yet evaluations are not without their costs.",
        "In addition to the financial resources required to support the evaluation, there are also the costs of researcher time and focus.",
        "Since a poorly defined evaluation task wastes research effort, it is important to examine the validity of an evaluation task.",
        "In this paper, we assess the quality of the new question answering task that was the focus of the TREC 2002 question answering track.",
        "TREC is a workshop series designed to encourage research on text retrieval for realistic applications by providing large test collections, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing results.",
        "The conference has focused primarily on the traditional information retrieval problem of retrieving a ranked list of documents in response to a statement of information need, but also includes other tasks, called tracks, that focus on new areas or particularly difficult aspects of information retrieval.",
        "A question answering (QA) track was started in TREC in 1999 (TREC-8) to address the problem of returning answers, rather than document lists, in response to a question.",
        "The task for each of the first three years of the QA track was essentially the same.",
        "Participants received a large corpus of newswire documents and a set of factoid questions such as How many calories are in a Big Mac?",
        "and Who invented the paper clip?.",
        "Systems were required to return a ranked list of up to five [document-id, answer-string] pairs per question such that each answer string was believed to contain an answer to the question.",
        "Human assessors read each string and decided whether the string actually did contain an answer to the question.",
        "An individual question received a score equal to the reciprocal of the rank at which the first correct response was returned, or zero if none of the five responses contained a correct answer.",
        "The score for a submission was then the mean of the individual questions’ reciprocal ranks.",
        "Analysis of the TREC-8 track confirmed the reliability of this evaluation task (Voorhees and Tice, 2000): the assessors understood and could do their assessing job; relative scores between systems were stable despite differences of opinion by assessors; and intuitively better systems received better scores.",
        "The task for the TREC 2002 QA track changed significantly from the previous years’ task, and thus a new assessment of the track is needed.",
        "This paper provides that assessment by examining both the ability of the human assessors to make the required judgments and the effect that differences in assessor opinions have on comparative results, plus empirically establishing confidence intervals for the reliability of a comparison as a function of the difference in effectiveness scores.",
        "The first section defines the 2002 QA task and provides a brief summary of the system results.",
        "The following three sections look at each of the evaluation issues in turn.",
        "The final section summarizes the findings, and outlines shortcomings of the evaluation that remain to be addressed."

        "The first difference was that systems were to return exact answers rather than the text snippets containing an answer that were accepted previously.",
        "The second difference was that systems were required to return exactly one response per question and the questions were to be ranked by the system’s confidence in the answer it had found.",
        "The change to exact answers was motivated by the belief that a system’s ability to recognize the precise extent of the answer is crucial to improving question answering technology.",

        "Each of the answer strings shown in Figure 1 was judged correct for the question What river in the US is known as the Big Muddy?, yet earlier responses are clearly better than later ones.",

        "The guidelines also suggested that ungrammatical responses are generally not exact; a location question can have “in Mississippi” as an exact answer, but not “Mississippi in”.",
        "The guidelines also emphasized that even “quality” responses – strings that contained both a correct answer and justification for that answer – were to be",

        "Note, however, that there were only 3725 pairs that had at least one judge assign a judgment that was something other than ‘wrong’.",
        "Thus, there was some disagreement among the judges for half of all responses that were not obviously wrong.",

        "Instead, many of the granularity differences observed in earlier QA judgment sets (Voorhees and Tice, 2000) are now reflected in this distinction.",
        "For example, a correct response for Who is Tom Cruise married to?",
        "is Nicole Kidman.",

        "Some assessors also accepted “actress Nicole Kidman”, which some rejected as inexact.",
        "Similar issues arose with dates and place names.",

        "For example, when the correct response is April 20, 1999, is April 19, 1999 wrong or inexact?",

        "Correlations are slightly higher for the adjudicated judgment set, probably because the adjudicated set has a very small incidence of errors.",
        "The higher correlation for the raw count measure likely reflects the fact that the confidence-weighted score is much more sensitive to differences in judgments for questions at small (close to one) ranks.",

        "It is not surprising that an evaluation based on one response per question is less stable than an evaluation based on five responses per question – there is inherently less information included in the evaluation.",

        "It would be nice to have a critical value for such that correlations greater than the critical value guarantee a quality evaluation.",
        "Unfortunately, no such value can exist since values depend on the set of runs being compared.",

        "Examination of the track results did show some increase in variability, but also confirmed that system comparisons are sufficiently stable for an effective evaluation.",
        "Human assessors do not always agree as to whether an answer is exact, but the differences reflect the well-known differences in opinion as to correctness rather than inherent difficulty in recognizing whether an answer is exact.",
        "The confidence-weighted score is sensitive to changes in judgments for questions that are ranked highly, and therefore is a less stable measure than a raw count of number correct.",
        "Nonetheless, all of the observed inversions in confidence-weighted scores when systems were evaluated using different judgment sets were between systems whose scores differed by less than 0.07, the smallest difference for which the error rate of concluding two runs are different is less than 5 % for test sets of 500 questions.",
        "A major part of the cost an evaluation is building the necessary evaluation infrastructure such as training materials, scoring procedures, and judgment sets.",
        "The net cost of an evaluation is greatly reduced if such infrastructure is reusable since the initial costs are amortized over many additional users.",
        "Reusable infrastructure also accelerates the pace of technological advancement since it allows researchers to run their own experiments and receive rapid feedback as to the quality of alternative methods.",
        "Unfortunately, neither the initial task within the TREC QA track nor the TREC 2002 task produces a reusable QA test collection.",
        "That is, it is not currently possible to use the judgment set produced during TREC to accurately evaluate a QA run that uses the same document and question sets as the TREC runs but was not judged by the human assessors.",
        "Methods for approximating evaluation scores exist (Breck et al., 2000; Voorhees and Tice, 2000), but they are not completely reliable.",
        "A key area for future work is to devise a truly reusable QA evaluation infrastructure."
