        "We presented two versions of a two-level alignment model for morphologically rich languages.",
        "We observed that information provided by word translations and morpheme translations interact in a way that enables the model to be receptive to the partial information in rarely occurring words through their frequently occurring morphemes.",
        "We obtained significant improvement of BLEU scores over IBM Model 4.",
        "In conclusion, morphologically aware word alignment models prove to be superior to their word-only counterparts."
