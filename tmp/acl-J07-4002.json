        "Work on PP attachment resolution generally assumes that there is an oracle that provides the quadruple (v,n1,p,n2), where we define an oracle as a mechanism that provides information that is not present in the data in their naturally occurring form.",

        "In an application, a PP attachment module would be used to change the attachment of prepositional phrases in preliminary syntactic analyses produced by a parser – or reattach them.",
        "The problem with oracle-based work on PP attachment is that when the parser does not find the gold-standard NP1 or PP, for instance, the attachment ambiguity is not recognized, and the correct solution cannot",

        "Our experiments show that oracle-based evaluation of PP attachment can be misleading.",
        "Comparing the bilexical and trilexical cases we note the following: when accurate n2 information (i.e., oracle-based information about which word heads NP2) is added in Experiment 1, disambiguation results improve.",
        "When noisy n2-information is added in Experiment 2 (in the absence of an oracle), disambiguation results get worse.",
        "Similarly, oracle-based disambiguation performance (84.14%) is much higher than unaided performance (80.01%) in Experiment 2.",
        "It is not clear from our results whether or not PP reattachers perform better than state-of-the-art parsers.",
        "Although the differences between the best parsing results and the best reattacher results are not significant in Experiments 1 and 2, the reattachers had consistently higher performance.",
        "This makes it likely that PP reattachment (performed either by a reattacher or by a reranker [Charniak and Johnson 2005; Collins and Koo 2005] that processes a feature representation with PP attachment information) would improve the parsing results of state-of-the-art parsers.",
        "This is a promising direction for future work on PP reattachment.",
        "Our results suggest that the standard oracle-based method for evaluating PP attachment is problematic.",
        "It computes numbers that are overly optimistic when compared to the performance that is to be expected in realistic applications without oracles.",
        "Instead, PP reattachers should be directly compared to state-of-the-art parsers to show that they are able to exploit statistical information that current parsing methods ignore.",
        "Most importantly, PP reattachers should be tested on the type of data they are intended to process – output from a parser or another module that detects PP attachment ambiguities.",
        "Evaluating reattachers on the output of an oracle allows no inferences as to their real performance.",
        "Many advances in NLP in the last decades have been driven by shared tasks, and PP attachment is one of the tasks that has stimulated much interesting research.",
        "There are no realistic scenarios in which an oracle for PP attachment ambiguity would be available, however.",
        "Given the differences we have found between evaluations with and without oracles, one should think carefully about the experimental framework for PP attachment work one adopts and whether any oracle-based findings carry over to more realistic scenarios without oracles.",
        "Although we are only concerned with PP attachment in this article, similar considerations likely apply to other disambiguation tasks such as attachment of relative clauses and coordinated phrases.",
        "In our opinion the evaluation of disambiguation algorithms on oracle-based data should always be justified by stating specifically what has been learned for the non-oracle case."
