        "The main purpose of the current study is to investigate the extent to which a probabilistic part-of-speech (POS) tagger can correctly model human sentence processing data.",
        "Syntactically ambiguous sentences have been studied in great depth in psycholinguistics because the pattern of ambiguity resolution provides a window onto the human sentence processing mechanism (HSPM).",
        "Prima facie it seems unlikely that such a tagger will be adequate, because almost all previous researchers have assumed, following standard linguistic theory, that a formally adequate account of recursive syntactic structure is an essential component of any model of the behaviour.",
        "In this study, we tested a bigram POS tagger on different types of structural ambiguities and (as a sanity check) to the well-known asymmetry of subject and object relative clause processing.",
        "Theoretically, the garden-path effect is defined as processing difficulty caused by reanalysis.",
        "Empirically, it is attested as comparatively slower reading time or longer eye fixation at a disambiguating region in an ambiguous sentence compared to its control sentences (Frazier and Rayner, 1982; Trueswell, 1996).",
        "That is, the garden-path effect detected in many human studies, in fact, is measured through a “comparative” method.",
        "This characteristic of the sentence processing research design is reconstructed in the current study using a probabilistic POS tagging system.",
        "Under the assumption that larger probability decrease indicates slower reading time, the test results suggest that the probabilistic POS tagging system can predict reading time penalties at the disambiguating region of garden-path sentences compared to that of non-garden-path sentences (i.e. control sentences)."

        "The findings here suggest that a statistical POS tagging system is more informative than Crocker and Corley demonstrated.",
        "It has a predictive power of processing delay not only for lexically ambiguous sentences but also for structurally garden-pathed sentences.",
        "This model is attractive since it is computationally simpler and requires few statistical parameters.",
        "More importantly, it is clearly defined what predictions can be and cannot be made by this model.",
        "This allows systematic testability and refutability of the model unlike some other probabilistic frameworks.",
        "Also, the model training and testing is transparent and observable, and true probability rather than transformed weights are used, all of which makes it easy to understand the mechanism of the proposed model.",
        "Although the model we used in the current study is not a novelty, the current work largely differs from the previous study in its scope of data used and the interpretation of the model for human sentence processing.",
        "Corley and Crocker clearly state that their model is strictly limited to lexical ambiguity resolution, and their test of the model was bounded to the noun-verb ambiguity.",
        "However, the findings in the current study play out differently.",
        "The experiments conducted in this study are parallel to empirical studies with regard to the design of experimental method and the test material.",
        "The garden-path sentences used in this study are authentic, most of them are selected from the cited literature, not conveniently coined by the authors.",
        "The word-by-word probability comparison between garden-path sentences and their controls is parallel to the experimental design widely adopted in empirical studies in the form of region-by-region reading or eye-gaze time comparison.",
        "In the word-by-word probability comparison, the model is tested whether or not it correctly predicts the comparative processing difficulty at the garden-path region.",
        "Contrary to the major claim made in previous empirical studies, which is that the garden-path phenomena are either modeled by syntactic principles or by structural frequency, the findings here show that the same phenomena can be predicted without such structural information.",
        "Therefore, the work is neither a mere extended application of Corley and Crocker’s work to a broader range of data, nor does it simply confirm earlier observations that finite state machines might accurately account for psycholinguistic results to some degree.",

      "heading": "5 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Our studies show that, at least for the sample of test materials that we culled from the standard literature, a statistical POS tagging system can predict processing difficulty in structurally ambiguous garden-path sentences.",
        "The statistical POS tagger was surprisingly effective in modeling sentence processing data, given the locality of the probability distribution.",
        "The findings in this study provide an alternative account for the garden-path effect observed in empirical studies, specifically, that the slower processing times associated with garden-path sentences are due in part to their relatively unlikely POS sequences in comparison with those of non-garden-path sentences and in part to differences in the emission probabilities that the tagger learns.",
        "One attractive future direction is to carry out simulations that compare the evolution of probabilities in the tagger with that in a theoretically more powerful model trained on the same data, such as an incremental statistical parser (Wang et al., 2004; Roark, 2001).",
        "In so doing we can find the places where the prediction problem faced both by the HSPM and the machines that aspire to emulate it actually warrants the greater power of structurally sensitive models, using this knowledge to mine large corpora for future experiments with human subjects.",
        "We have not necessarily cast doubt on the hypothesis that the HSPM makes crucial use of structural information, but we have demonstrated that much of the relevant behavior can be captured in a simple model.",
        "The ’structural’ regularities that we observe are reasonably well encoded into this model.",
        "For purposes of initial real-time processing it could be that the HSPM is using a similar encoding of structural regularities into convenient probabilistic or neural form.",
        "It is as yet unclear what the final form of a cognitively accurate model along these lines would be, but it is clear from our study that it is worthwhile, for the sake of clarity and explicit testability, to consider models that are simpler and more precisely specified than those assumed by dominant theories of human sentence processing."
