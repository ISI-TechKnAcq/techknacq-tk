        "The application of quantitative methods in historical linguistics has attracted a lot of attention in recent years (cf. Steiner et al. (2011) for a survey).",
        "Many ideas have been adapted from evolutionary biology and bioinformatics, where similar problems occur with respect to the genealogical grouping of species and the multiple alignment of strings/sequences.",
        "One of the main differences between those areas and attempts to uncover language history is the limited amount of suitable data that can serve as the basis for language comparison.",
        "A widely used resource are Swadesh lists or similar collections of translational equivalents in the form of word lists.",
        "Likewise, phylogenetic methods have been applied using structural characteristics (e.g., Dunn et al. (2005)).",
        "In this paper, we propose yet another data source, namely parallel texts.",
        "Many analogies have been drawn between the evolution of species and languages (see, for instance, Pagel (2009) for such a comparison).",
        "One of the central problems is to establish what is the equivalent of the gene in the reproduction of languages.",
        "Like in evolutionary biology, where gene sequences in organisms are compared to infer phylogenetic trees, a comparison of the ?genes?",
        "of language would be most appropriate for a quantitative analysis of languages.",
        "Yet, Swadeshlike wordlists or structural characteristics do not neatly fit into this scheme as they are most likely not the basis on which languages are replicated.",
        "After all, language is passed on as the expression of propositions, i.e. sentences, which usually consists of more than single words.",
        "Hence, following Croft (2000), we assume that the basic unit of replication is a linguistic structure embodied in a concrete utterance.",
        "According to this view, strings of DNA in biological evolution correspond to utterances in language evolution.",
        "Accordingly, genes (i.e., the functional elements of a string of DNA) correspond to linguistic structures occurring in those utterances.",
        "Linguistic replicators (the ?genes?",
        "of language) are thus structures in the context of an utterance.",
        "Such replicators are not only the words as parts of the sentence but also constructions to express a complex semantic structure, or phonetic",
        "realizations of a phoneme, to give just a few examples.",
        "In this paper, we want to propose an approach that we consider to be a first step in the direction of using the structure of utterances as the basic unit for the comparison of languages.",
        "For this purpose, a multilingual alignment of words in parallel sentences (as the equivalent of utterances in parallel texts) is computed, similar to multi-species alignments of DNA sequences.",
        "These alignments are clusters of words from different languages in the parallel translations of the same sentence.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we quickly review the position of our approach in relation to the large body of work on parallel text analysis (Section 2).",
        "Then we describe the method for the multilingual alignment of words (Section 3).",
        "Since the number of languages and sentences that have to be analyzed require a lot of computationally expensive calculations of co-occurrence counts, the whole analysis is reformulated into manipulations of sparse matrices.",
        "The various steps are presented in detail to give a better overview of the calculations that are needed to infer the similarities.",
        "Subsequently, we give a short description of the material that we used in order to test our method (Section 4).",
        "In Section 5 we report on some of the experiments that we carried out, followed by a discussion of the results and their implications.",
        "Finally, we conclude with directions for future work in this area."

        "Alignment of words using parallel texts has been widely applied in the field of statistical machine translation (cf. Koehn (2010)).",
        "Alignment methods have largely been employed for bitexts, i.e., parallel texts of two languages (Tiedemann, 2011).",

        "per, however, is to investigate what can be gained when including additional languages in the alignment process at the same time and not iteratively looking for correspondences in pairs of languages (see Simard (1999), Simard (2000) for a similar approach).",
        "There are basically two approaches to computing word alignments as discussed in the literature (cf. Och and Ney (2003)): (i) statistical alignment models and (ii) heuristic models.",
        "The former have traditionally been used for the training of parameters in statistical machine translation and are characterized by their high complexity, which makes them difficult to implement and tune.",
        "The latter are considerably simpler and thus easier to implement as they only require a function for the association of words, which is computed from their co-occurrence counts.",
        "A wide variety of co-occurrence measures have been employed in the literature.",
        "We decided to use a heuristic method for the first steps reported on here, but plan to integrate statistical alignment models for future work.",
        "Using a global co-occurrence measure, we pursue an approach in which the words are compared for each sentence individually, but for all languages at the same time.",
        "That is, a co-occurrence matrix is created for each sentence, containing all the words of all languages that occur in the corresponding translational equivalents for that sentence.",
        "This matrix then serves as the input for a partitioning algorithm whose results are interpreted as a partial alignment of the sentence.",
        "In most cases, the resulting alignments do not include words from all languages.",
        "Only those words that are close translational equivalents occur in alignments.",
        "This behavior, while not optimal for machine translation, is highly useful for language comparison because differences between languages are implicitly marked as such by splitting different structures into separate alignments.",
        "The languages are then compared on the basis of having words in the same clusters with other languages.",
        "The more word forms they share in the same clusters, the more similar the languages are considered to be.",
        "The form of the words themselves is thereby of no importance.",
        "What counts 3A related approach is discussed in Wa?lchli (2011).",
        "The biggest difference to the present approach is that Wa?lchli only compares languages pairwise.",
        "In addition, he makes use of a global glossing method and not an alignment of words within the same parallel sentence.",
        "is their frequency of co-occurrence in alignments across languages.",
        "This is in stark contrast to methods which focus on the form of words with similar meanings (e.g., using Swadesh lists) in order to compute some kind of language similarity.",
        "One major disadvantage of the present approach for a comparison of languages from a historical perspective is the fact that such similarities also could be a consequence of language contact.",
        "This is a side effect that is shared by the word list approach, in which loanwords have a similar effect on the results.",
        "It has to be seen how strongly this influences the final results in order to assess whether our current approach is useful for the quantitative analysis of genealogical relatedness."

        "The reason for this choice is that this clustering does not require a predefined number of clusters, but establishes the optimal number of clusters together with the clustering itself.4 In addition, it yields an exemplar for each cluster, which is the most typical member of the cluster.",
        "This enables an inspection of intermediate results of what the clusters actually contain.",

        "One major problem with using our approach for phylogentic reconstruction is the influence of language contact.",
        "Traits of the languages which are not inherited from a common proto-language but are transmitted through contact situations lead to noise in the similarity matrix which does not reflect a genealogical signal.",
        "However, other methods also suffer from the shortcoming that language contact cannot be automatically subtracted from the comparison of languages without manual input (such as manually created cognate lists).",
        "With translational equivalents, a further problem for the present approach is the influence of trans-lationese on the results.",
        "If one version in a language is a direct translation of another language, the structural similarity might get a higher score due to the fact that constructions will be literally translated which otherwise would be expressed differently in that language.",
        "The experiments that have been presented in this paper are only a first step.",
        "However, we firmly believe that a multilingual alignment of words is more appropriate for a large-scale comparison of languages than an iterative bilingual alignment.",
        "Yet so far we do not have the appropriate evaluation method to prove this.",
        "We therefore plan to include a validation scheme in order to test how much can be gained from the simultaneous analysis of more than two languages.",
        "Apart from this, we intend to improve the alignment method itself by integrating techniques from statistical alignment models, like adding morpheme separation or phrase structures into the analysis.",
        "Another central problem for the further development of this method is the selection of alignments for the language comparison.",
        "As our second experiment showed, just starting from a selection of English words will not automatically generate the corresponding words in the other languages.",
        "It is possible to use the AA matrices to search for further similar alignments, but this procedure is not yet formalized enough to automatically produce language classification for selected linguistic domains (like for the PERSON interrogatives in our experiment).",
        "When this step is better understood, we will be able to automatically generate typological parameters for a large number of the world's languages, and thus easily produce more data on which to base future language comparison."
