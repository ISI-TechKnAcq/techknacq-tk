        "Access to reliable annotated data is the first hurdle encountered in most NLP tasks be it at the level of Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging or a more complex discourse level annotation.",
        "The performance of the machine learning approaches which have become de rigueur for most NLP tasks are dependent on accurately annotated large datasets.",
        "Creation of such databases is, hence, a highly resource intensive task both in terms of time and expertise.",
        "While the cost of an annotation task can be characterized by the number of man-hours and the level of expertise required, the productivity or the benefit can be measured in terms of the reliability and usability of the end-product, i.e., the annotated dataset.",
        "It is thus no surprise that considerable effort has gone into developing techniques and tools that can effectively boost the benefit-to-cost ratio of the annotation process.",
        "These include, but are not limited to:",
        "(a) exploiting the reach of the web to reduce the effort required for annotation (see, e.g., Snow et al.",
        "(2008) and references therein)",
        "(c) using supervised learning to bootstrap a small annotated dataset to automatically label a larger corpus and getting it corrected by human annotators (see, e.g., Tomanek et al.",
        "(2007); Wu et al.",
        "(2007))",
        "(d) Active Learning (Ringger et al.",
        "2007) where only those data-points which are directly relevant for training are presented for manual annotation.",
        "Methods exploiting the web-users for linguistic annotation are particularly popular these days, presumably because of the success of the ESPGame (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004) and its successors in image annotation.",
        "A more recent study by (Snow et al., 2008) shows that annotated data obtained from non-expert anonymous web-users is as good as those obtained from experts.",
        "However, unlike the game model, here the task is distributed among non-experts through an Internet portal such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, and the users are paid for their annotations.",
        "This might lead to an impression that the expert knowledge is dispensable for NLP annotation tasks.",
        "However, while these approaches may work for more simple tasks like those described in (Snow et al., 2008), most NLP related annotation tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, semantic role labeling, Treebank annotation and discourse level tagging, require expertise in the relevant linguistic area.",
        "In this work, we present a case study of POS annotation in Bangla and Hindi using a hierarchical tagset, where we observe that reliable linguistic annotation requires not only expert annotators, but also a great deal of supervision.",
        "A generic user interface for facilitating the task of hierarchical word level linguistic annotation was designed and experiments conducted to measure the inter-annotator agreement (IA) and annotation time.",
        "It is observed that the tool can significantly accelerate the annotation process and increase the IA.",
        "The productivity of the annotation process is further enhanced through bootstrapping, whereby a little amount of manually annotated data is used to train an automatic POS tagger.",
        "The annotators are then asked to edit the data already tagged by the automatic tagger using an appropriate user interface.",
        "However, the most significant observation to emerge from these experiments is that irrespective of the complexity of the annotation task (see Sec. 2 for definition), language, design of the user interface and the accuracy of the automatic POS tagger used during bootstrapping, the productivity and reliability of the expert annotators working under close supervision of the dataset designer is higher than that of non-experts or those working without expert-supervision.",
        "This leads us to believe that among the four aforementioned approaches for improving the benefit-to-cost ratio of the annotation tasks, solution (a) does not seem to be the right choice for involved linguistic annotations; rather, approaches (b), (c) and (d) show more promise.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief introduction to IL-POST - a hierarchical POS Tag framework for Indian Languages which is used for defining the specific annotation tasks used for the experiments.",
        "The design and features of the data annotation tool are described in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 presents the experiments conducted for POS labeling task of Bangla and Hindi while the results of these experiments are discussed in Section 5.",

        "2008).",
        "It supports a three-level hierarchy of Categories, Types and Attributes that provides a systematic method to annotate language specific categories without disregarding the shared traits of the Indian languages.",
        "This allows the framework to offer flexibility, cross-linguistic compatibility and reusability across several languages and applications.",
        "An important consequence of its hierarchical structure and decomposable tags is that it allows users to specify the morpho-syntactic information applicable at the desired granularity according to the specific language and task.",
        "The complete framework supports 11 categories at the top level with 32 types at the second level to represent the main POS categories and their sub-types.",
        "Further, 18 morphological attributes or features are associated with the types.",
        "The framework can thus, be used to derive a flat tagset of only 11 categories or a complex three level tagset of several thousand tags depending on the language and/or application.",

        "The annotation scheme followed for linguistic data creation is heavily dependent on the end-application the data will cater to.",
        "Moreover, annotations are often performed by trained linguists who, in the Indian context, are either novice or intermittent users of computer.",
        "These observations led us to adopt the following principles: (1) customizability of the interface to any word level annotation task; (2) mouse driven selection of tags for faster and less erroneous annotation; and (3) display of all possible choices at every stage of the task to reduce memorization overload.",
        "Apart from the surface controls, the interface also supports automatic selection facility that highlights the next unlabeled word that needs to be annotated.",
        "After loading the task (i.e., a sentence) it automatically highlights the first unla-beled word.",
        "Once a tag is assigned to the highlighted word, the next unlabeled word is automatically selected.",
        "However, the automatic selection module can be stopped by selecting a particular word through a mouse click.",
        "The first two levels of the IL-POST hierarchy are displayed (on a right mouse click) as a two level context menu.",
        "This is illustrated in Fig. 3(a).",
        "On selection of the category and type by left clicks, a window is dynamically generated for the assignment of the attribute values, i.e., the third level of the hierarchy.",
        "A drop down box is associated with each attribute for selecting the appropriate values.",
        "This is shown in Fig. 3(b).",
        "The default values for each of the attributes are set based on the frequency of occurrence of the values in a general corpus.",
        "This further reduces the time of tag assignment.",
        "When the user clicks \"OK\" on the attribute assignment window, the system automatically generates the tag as per the user's selection and displays it in the Text-box just after the selected word.",
        "While performing the annotation task, human annotators need to label every word of a sentence.",
        "Instead of annotating every word from scratch, we incorporate machine intelligence to automatically label every word in a sentence.",
        "Suppose that we have an automatic POS tag prediction module that does a fairly accurate job.",
        "In that case, the task of annotation would mean editing the preassigned tags to the words.",
        "We hypothesize that such an editing based annotation task that incorporates some intelligence in the form of a tagger will be much faster than purely manual annotation, provided that the preassigned tags are \"sufficiently accurate\".",
        "Thus, human annotators only need to edit a particular word whenever machine assigns an incorrect tag making the process faster.",
        "We also make certain changes to the basic interface for facilitating easy editing.",
        "In particular, when the corpus is loaded using the interface, the predicted tags are shown for each word and the first category-type is highlighted automatically.",
        "The user can navigate to the next or pervious editable positions (Category-Type or Attributes) by using the Shift and the Ctrl keys respectively.",
        "The user may edit a particular preassigned tag by making a right mouse click and choosing from the usual context menus or attribute editing window.",
        "The user also has the provision to choose an editable location by left mouse-click.",
        "We developed a statistical POS tagger based on Cyclic Dependency Network (Toutanova et al., 2003) as an initial annotator for the Edit mode annotation.",
        "The tagger was trained for Bangla and Hindi on the data that was created during the first phase of annotation (i.e. annotation from scratch).",
        "We developed taggers for both Cate-gory+Type level (CT) and Category+Type+ Attribute level (CTA).",
        "We also developed two versions of the same tagger with high and low accuracies for each level of the annotation by controlling the amount of training data.",
        "As we shall see in Sec. 4 and 5, the different versions of the tagger at various levels of the hierarchy and accuracy will help us to understand the relation between the Edit mode annotation, and the complexity of the tagset and the accuracy of the tagger used for initial annotation.",
        "The taggers were trained on 1457 sentences (approximately 20,000 words) for Bangla and 2366 sentences (approximately 45,000 words) for Hindi.",
        "The taggers were tested on 256 sentences (~ 3,500 words) for Bangla and 591 sentences for Hindi, which are disjoint from the training corpus.",
        "The evaluation of a hierarchical tagset is non-trivial because the error in the machine tagged data with respect to the gold standard should take into account the level of the hierarchy where the mismatch between the two takes place.",
        "Clearly, mismatch at the category or type level should incur a higher penalty than one at the level of the attributes.",
        "If for a word, there is a mismatch between the type assigned by the machine and that present in the gold standard, then it is assumed to be a full error (equivalent to 1 unit).",
        "On the other hand, if the type assigned is correct, then the error is 0.5 times the fraction of attributes that do not agree with the gold standard.",
        "Table 1 reports the accuracies of the various taggers.",
        "Note that the attributes in IL-POST correspond to morphological features.",
        "Unlike Bangla, we do not have access to a morphological analyzer for Hindi to predict the attributes during the POS tagging at the CTA level.",
        "Therefore, the tagging accuracy in the CTA level for Hindi is lower than that of Bangla even though the amount of training data used in Hindi is much higher than that in Bangla."

        "In order to understand the reasons of disagreement between the annotators, we analyze the confusion matrix for different pairs of users for the various experimental scenarios.",
        "We observe that the causes of disagreement are primarily of three kinds: (1) unspecified and/or ambiguous guidelines, (2) ignorance about the guidelines, and (3) inherent ambiguities present in the sentences.",
        "We have found that a large number of the errors are due to type (1).",
        "For example, in attribute level annotation, for every attribute two special values are '0' (denotes 'not applicable for the particular lexical item') and 'x' (denotes 'undecided or doubtful to the annotator').",
        "However, we find that both trained and untrained annotators have their own distinct patterns of assigning '0' or 'x'.",
        "Later we made this point clearer with examples and enumerated possible cases of '0' and 'x' tags.",
        "This was very helpful in improving the IA.",
        "A major portion of the errors made by the untrained users are due to type (2).",
        "For example, it was clearly mentioned in the annotation guidelines that if a borrowed/foreign word is written in the native script, then it has to be tagged according to its normal morpho-syntactic function in the sentence.",
        "However, if a word is typed in foreign script, then it has to be tagged as a foreign word.",
        "However, none of the untrained annotators adhered to these rules strictly.",
        "Finally, there are instances which are inherently ambiguous.",
        "For example, in noun-noun compounds, a common confusion is whether the first noun is to be tagged as a nouns or an adjective.",
        "These kinds of confusions are evenly distributed over all the users and at every level of annotation.",
        "One important fact that we arrive at through the analysis of the confusion matrices is that the trained annotators working under close supervision have few and consistent error patterns over all the experiments, whereas the untrained annotators exhibit no consistent and clearly definable error patterns.",
        "This is not surprising because the training helps the annotators to understand the task and the annotation scheme clearly; on the other hand, constant supervision helps clarifying doubts arising during annotation."

        "In this paper we reported our observations for POS annotation experiments for Bangla and Hindi using the IL-POST annotation scheme under various scenarios.",
        "Experiments in Tamil and Sanskrit are planned in the future.",
        "We argue that the observations from the various experiments make a case for the need of training and supervision for the annotators as well as the use of appropriate annotation interfaces and techniques such as bootstrapping.",
        "The results are indicative in nature and need to be validated with larger number of annotators.",
        "We summarize our salient contributions/conclusions:",
        "• The generic tool described here for complex and hierarchical word level annotation is effective in accelerating the annotation task as well as improving the IA.",
        "Thus, the tool helps reducing the cognitive load associated with annotation.",
        "• Bootstrapping, whereby POS tags are preassigned by an automatic tagger and human annotators are required to edit the incorrect labels, further accelerates the task, at the risk of slight influence of the preassigned labels.",
        "• Although with the help of the tool and techniques such as bootstrapping we are able to bring down the time required by untrained annotators to the level of their trained counterparts, the IA, and hence the reliability of the annotated data for the former is always poorer.",
        "Hence, training and supervision is very important for reliable linguistic annotation.",
        "We would like to emphasize the last point because recently it is being argued that Internet and other game based techniques can be effectively used for gathering annotated data for NLP.",
        "While this may be suitable for certain types of annotations, such as word sense, lexical similarity or affect (see Snow et al.",
        "(2008) for details), we argue that many mainstream linguistic annotation tasks such as POS, chunk, semantic roles and Treebank annotations call for expertise, training and close supervision.",
        "We believe that there is no easy way out to this kind of complex linguistic annotations, though smartly designed annotation interfaces and methods such as bootstrapping and active learning can significantly improve the productivity and reliability, and therefore, should be explored and exploited in future."
