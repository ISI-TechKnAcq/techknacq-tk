        "A methodological decision was made early on to appeal to nonlinguistic information only as a last resort.",
        "The motivation for this was twofold.",
        "In the first place, domain driven systems are inherently limited by the vast amounts of domain specific information required to process even the simplest texts.",
        "There appears little hope of generalizing these systems so that they are capable of exploiting structural commonalities between stories and dialogues from different domains.",
        "Secondly, reliance on domain knowledge for quick fixes to text processing problems tends to deaden sensitivity to linguistic information present in those texts.",
        "I am convinced that linguistic cues play a far richer and more powerful role in natural language understanding than has been commonly supposed and that speech act analysis will prove a useful tool for systematically investigating those cues.",
        "I conclude with an illustration of how domain and language driven approaches to story understanding might differ.",

        "2-3).",
        "\"One day John went through a red light and was pulled over by a cop.",
        "John had just gotten a summons for speeding the previous week, and was told that if he got another violation, his license would be taken away.",
        "Then John remembered that he had two tickets for the Giant's game on him.",

        "Q1 Why did John offer the cop a couple of tickets?",
        "Al Because he was afraid he was going to lose his license if he got another summons.\" Wilensky has this to say about the story.",
        "\"Consider what is involved in making the inference that John offered the cop his football tickets to prevent the loss of his license.",
        "First, the reader would have to infer that the cop was going to give John a traffic ticket.",
        "This inference requires the knowledge that a policeman is supposed to ticket people who break traffic rules... Now the reader must interpret John's statement to the cop as an attempt to prevent him from giving him a ticket.",
        "To interpret this sentence as an offer, a reader must know that one way to prevent someone from doing something is to persuade him not to do it....by offering him something desirable in exchange for his cooperation.",
        "The understander can (then) infer that football tickets are desirable to a football fan, since football tickets are necessary for getting into a football game.\" Wilensky is setting the stage for a domain driven theory of understanding in which large stores of nonlinguistic knowledge are required for story comprehension.",
        "Ironically, this very type of knowledge often impedes rather than assists comprehension, a fact known to every writer who has employed the O'Henry formula to surprise his audience.",
        "One can imagine such a writer adding a short paragraph to Wilensky's story in which it is revealed that John, desperately hoping to lose his license, had threatened the cop with football tickets, a threat which proved pathetically ineffective.",

At this point the schema lends itself to two quite different interpretations.",

        "There is a strong probability that the the reason why getting another D is undesirable is because it would lead to F. So F too is most likely undesirable from A's perspective.",
