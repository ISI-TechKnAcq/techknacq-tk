        "When we read or write documents in a foreign language, we need more knowledge than what is provided in an ordinary dictionary, such as terminology, words relevant to current affairs, etc.",
        "Such expressions can be made up of multiple words, and there are almost infinite possible variations.",
        "Therefore, so it is quite difficult to add them and their translations to a dictionary.",
        "Many approaches have tried to acquire translation equivalents automatically from parallel corpora (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Fung, 1995).",
        "In parallel corpora, effective features that have obvious correlations between these corpora can be used – e.g., similarity of position and frequency of words.",
        "However, we cannot always get enough parallel corpora to extract the desired information.",
        "We propose a method of measuring the similarity to acquire compound noun translations by corpus information, which is not restricted to parallel corpora.",

        "In parallel corpora, positions and frequencies of translation equivalents are correlated; therefore, when we try to find translation equivalents from parallel corpora, this information provides valuable clues.",
        "On the other hand, in non-parallel corpora, positions and frequencies of words cannot be directly compared.",
        "Fung assumed that co-occurring words of translation equivalents are similar, and compared distributions of the co-occurring words to acquire Chinese-English translations from comparable corpora (Fung, 1997).",
        "This method generates co-occurring words vectors for target words, and judges the pair of words whose similarity is high to be translation equivalents.",
        "Rapp made German and English association word vectors and calculated the similarity of these vectors to find translations (Rapp, 1999).",
        "K.Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996) also assumed the resemblance between co-occurring words in a source language and those in a target language, and performed experiments to find irrelevant translations intentionally added to a dictionary.",
        "In fact, finding translation equivalents from non-parallel corpora is a very difficult problem, so it is not practical to acquire all kinds of translations in the corpora.",
        "Most technical terms are composed of known words, and we must collect these words to translate them correctly because new terms can be infinitely created by combining several words.",
        "We focus on translations of compound nouns here.",
        "First, we collect the translation candidates of a target compound, and then measure the similarity between them to choose an appropriate candidate.",
        "In many cases, translation pairs of compound nouns in different languages have corresponding component words, and these can be used as strong clues to finding the translations (Tanaka and Matsuo, 1999).",
        "However, these clues are sometimes insufficient for determining which is the best translation for a target compound noun when two or more candidates exist.",
        "For example, 'RV 111� eigyo rieki, which means earnings before interest and taxes, can be paired with operating profits or business interest.",
        "Both pairs have common components, and we cannot judge which pair is better using only this information.",
        "A reasonable way to discriminate their meanings and usages is to see the context in which the compound words appear.",
        "In the following example, we can judge operating profits is a numerical value and business interest is a kind of group.",
        "• ... its fourth-quarter operating profit will fall short of expectations ... • ... the powerful coalition of business interests is pumping money into advertisements ...",
        "Thus contextual information helps us discriminate words’ categories.",
        "We use the distribution of co-occurring words to compare the context.",
        "This paper describes a method of measuring semantic similarity between compound nouns in different languages to acquire compound noun translations from non-parallel corpora.",
        "We choose Japanese and English as the language pairs.",

        "and each element of TE.",
        "In the first stage, this method collects target candidates CE by extracting all units that are described by a set of POS templates.",
        "For example, candidate translations of Japanese compound nouns may be English noun–noun, adjective–noun, noun–of–noun, etc.",
        "T.Tanaka and Matsuo (2001) reported that 60% of Japanese compound nouns in a terminological dictionary are noun-noun or noun-suffix type and 55% of English are noun-noun or adjective-noun.",
        "Next, it selects the compound nouns whose component words correspond to those of nouns of the original language cJ, and makes a set of translation candidates TE.",
        "The component words are connected by bilingual dictionaries and thesauri.",
        "For example, if cJ is R fij 1� eigyo rieki, the elements of TE are {business interest, operating profits, business gain}.",
        "The original method selects the most frequent candidate as the best one, however, this can be improved by using contextual information.",
        "Therefore we introduce the last stage; the proposed method calculates the similarity between the original compound noun cJ and its translation candidates by comparing the contexts, and chooses the most plausible translation cE.",
