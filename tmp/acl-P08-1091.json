        "Shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large strides in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving tacit semantic information from text.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is one such approach.",
        "With the advent of faster and more powerful computers, more effective machine learning algorithms, and importantly, large data resources annotated with relevant levels of semantic information, such as the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and ProbBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003), we are seeing a surge in efficient approaches to SRL (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "SRL is the process by which predicates and their arguments are identified and their roles are defined in a sentence.",
        "For example, in the English sentence, 'John likes apples.",
        "', the predicate is 'likes' whereas 'John' and 'apples', bear the semantic role labels agent (ARG0) and theme (ARG1).",
        "The crucial fact about semantic roles is that regardless of the overt syntactic structure variation, the underlying predicates remain the same.",
        "Hence, for the sentence 'John opened the door' and 'the door opened', though 'the door' is the object of the first sentence and the subject of the second, it is the 'theme' in both sentences.",
        "Same idea applies to passive constructions, for example.",
        "There is a widely held belief in the NLP and computational linguistics communities that identifying and defining roles of predicate arguments in a sentence has a lot of potential for and is a significant step toward improving important applications such as document retrieval, machine translation, question answering and information extraction (Moschitti et al., 2007).",
        "To date, most of the reported SRL systems are for English, and most of the data resources exist for English.",
        "We do see some headway for other languages such as German and Chinese (Erk and Pado, 2006; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004).",
        "The systems for the other languages follow the successful models devised for English, e.g. (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Thompson et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Moschitti, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Haghighi et al., 2005).",
        "In the same spirit and facilitated by the release of the Se-mEval 2007 Task 18 data, based on the Pilot Arabic Propbank, a preliminary SRL system exists for Arabic (Diab and Moschitti, 2007; Diab et al., 2007a).",
        "However, it did not exploit some special characteristics of the Arabic language on the SRL task.",
        "In this paper, we present an SRL system for MSA that exploits many aspects of the rich morphological features of the language.",
        "It is based on a supervised model that uses support vector machines (SVM) technology (Vapnik, 1998) for argument boundary detection and argument classification.",
        "It is trained and tested using the pilot Arabic Propbank data released as part of the SemEval 2007 data.",
        "Given the lack of a reliable Arabic deep syntactic parser, we use gold standard trees from the Arabic Tree Bank (ATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004).",
        "This paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 presents facts about the Arabic language especially in relevant contrast to English; Section 3 presents the approach and system adopted for this work; Section 4 presents the experimental setup, results and discussion.",
        "Finally, Section 5 draws our conclusions."

        "Arabic is a very different language from English in several respects relevant to the SRL task.",
        "Arabic is a semitic language.",
        "It is known for its templatic morphology where words are made up of roots and affixes.",
        "Clitics agglutinate to words.",
        "Clitics include prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns.",
        "In contrast to English, Arabic exhibits rich morphology.",
        "Similar to English, Arabic verbs explicitly encode tense, voice, Number, and Person features.",
        "Additionally, Arabic encodes verbs with Gender, Mood (subjunctive, indicative and jussive) information.",
        "For nominals (nouns, adjectives, proper names), Arabic encodes syntactic Case (accusative, genitive and nominative), Number, Gender and Definiteness features.",
        "In general, many of the morphological features of the language are expressed via short vowels also known as diacritics .",
        "Unlike English, syntactically Arabic is a pro-drop language, where the subject of a verb may be implicitly encoded in the verb morphology.",
        "Hence, we observe sentences such as JllLrdt JTI Akl AlbrtqAl 'ate-[he] the-oranges', where the verb Akl encodes the third Person Masculine Singular subject in the verbal morphology.",
        "It is worth noting that in the ATB 35% of all sentences are pro-dropped for subject (Maamouri et al., 2006).",
        "Unless the syntactic parse is very accurate in identifying the pro-dropped case, identifying the syntactic subject and the underlying semantic arguments are a challenge for such pro-drop cases.",
        "Arabic syntax exhibits relative free word order.",
        "Arabic allows for both subject-verb-object (SVO) and verb-subject-object (VSO) argument orders.",
        "In the VSO constructions, the verb agrees with the syntactic subject in Gender only, while in the SVO constructions, the verb agrees with the subject in both Number and Gender.",
        "Even though, in the ATB, an equal distribution of both VSO and SVO is observed (each appearing 30% of the time), it is known that in general Arabic is predominantly in VSO order.",
        "Moreover, the pro-drop cases could effectively be perceived as VSO orders for the purposes of SRL.",
        "Syntactic Case is very important in the cases ofVSO and pro-drop constructions as they indicate the syntactic roles of the object arguments with accusative Case.",
        "Unless the morphology of syntactic Case is explicitly present, such free word order could run the SRL system into significant confusion for many of the predicates where both arguments are semantically of the same type.",
        "Arabic exhibits more complex noun phrases than English mainly to express possession.",
        "These constructions are known as idafa constructions.",
        "Modern standard Arabic does not have a special particle expressing possession.",
        "In these complex structures a surface indefinite noun (missing an explicit definite article) may be followed by a definite noun marked with genitive Case, rendering the first noun syntactically definite.",
        "For example, cJI J»j rjl Albyt 'man the-house' meaning 'man of the house', Joj becomes definite.",
        "An adjective modifying the noun Jo-j will have to agree with it in Number, Gender, Definiteness, and Case.",
        "However, without explicit morphological encoding of these agreements, the scope of the arguments would be confusing to an SRL system.",
        "In a sentence such as Jj jJaJI ojJI J»j rjlu Albyti AlTwylu meaning 'the tall man of the house': 'man' is definite, masculine, singular, nominative, corresponding to Definiteness, Gender, Number and Case, respectively; the-house' is definite, masculine, singular, genitive; 'the-tall' is definite, masculine, singular, nominative.",
        "We note that man' and tall' agree in Number, Gender, Case and Definiteness.",
        "Syntactic Case is marked using short vowels u, and i at the end of the word.",
        "Hence, rjlu and AlTwylu agree in their Case ending Without the explicit marking of the Case information,",

        "Figure 1: Annotated Arabic Tree corresponding to 'Chinese Prime minister Zhu Rongjy started an official visit to India last Sunday.'",
        "namely in the word endings, it could be equally valid that 'the-tall' modifies 'the-house' since they agree in Number, Gender and Definiteness as explicitly marked by the Definiteness article Al.",
        "Hence, these idafa constructions could be tricky for SRL in the absence of explicit morphological features.",
        "This is compounded by the general absence of short vowels, expressed by diacritics (i.e. the u and i in rjlu and Al-byti,) in naturally occurring text.",
        "Idafa constructions in the ATB exhibit recursive structure, embedding other NPs, compared to English where possession is annotated with flat NPs and is designated by a possessive marker.",
        "Arabic texts are underspecified for diacritics to different degrees depending on the genre of the text (Diab et al., 2007b).",
        "Such an underspecification of diacritics masks some of the very relevant morpho-syntactic interactions between the different categories such as agreement between nominals and their modifiers as exemplified before, or verbs and their subjects.",
        "Having highlighted the differences, we hypothesize that the interaction between the rich morphology (if explicitly marked and present) and syntax could help with the SRL task.",
        "The presence of explicit Number and Gender agreement as well as Case information aids with identification of the syntactic subject and object even if the word order is relatively free.",
        "Gender, Number, Definiteness and Case agreement between nouns and their modifiers and other nominals, should give clues to the scope of arguments as well as their classes.",
        "The presence of such morpho-syntactic information should lead to better argument boundary detection and better classification."

        "Given a sentence, its predicates, as indicated by verbs, have to be identified along with their arguments.",
        "This problem is usually divided in two subtasks: (a) the detection of the target argument boundaries, i.e. the span of the argument words in the sentence, and (b) the classification of the argument type, e.g. Arg0 or ArgM for Propbank",

        "We adopt this solution, according to (Pradhan et al., 2005), since it is simple and effective.",
        "In the classification phase, given an unseen sentence, all its Fpa are generated and classified by each individual classifier CV The argument associated with the maximum among the scores provided by the individual classifiers is eventually selected.",
        "The above approach assigns labels independently, without considering the whole predicate argument structure.",
        "As a consequence, the classifier output may generate overlapping arguments.",
        "Thus, to make the annotations globally consistent, we apply a disambiguating heuristic adopted from (Diab and Mos-chitti, 2007) that selects only one argument among multiple overlapping arguments.",
        "The discovery of relevant features is, as usual, a complex task.",
        "The choice of features is further compounded for a language such as Arabic given its rich morphology and morpho-syntactic interactions.",
        "To date, there is a common consensus on the set of basic standard features for SRL, which we will refer to as standard.",

        "In our experiments we employ the features listed in Table 1, defined in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2004).",
        "For example, the Phrase Type indicates the syntactic type of the phrase labeled as a predicate argument, e.g. NP for ARG1 in Figure 1.",
        "The Parse Tree Path contains the path in the parse tree between the predicate and the argument phrase, expressed as a sequence of nonterminal labels linked by direction (up or down) symbols, e.g. VBD j VP [ NP for ARG1 in Figure 1.",
