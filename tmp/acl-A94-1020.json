        "The development of Natural Language (NL) systems for data retrieval has been a central issue in NL Processing research for the last three decades, motivated by the aim of helping non-expert database users.",
        "When we try to draw a line of evolution of such systems, it can be observed that growth in portability, essential for commercial viability, came at a cost in terms of broader linguistic coverage.'",
        "Earlier systems, mostly research motivated, were mainly developed for a single application, using domain-dependent information for treating contextual phenomena (eg, DEACON (Craig et al., 1966), SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972), LUNAR (Woods, 'The current system forms the base line for a joint SERC/DTI funded collaborative project between the University of Essex and Status IQ Ltd. for constructing an integrated platform for the retrieval of structured and textual data through Natural Language queries.",

        "1973), LADDER (Hendrix et al., 1978)).",
        "In contrast, the subsequent generation of interfaces carried a higher emphasis on portability in their design (eg, INTELLECT (Harris, 1984), IRUS (Bates et al., 1986), TEAM (Grosz et al., 1987)).",
        "These systems, however, offer a reduced coverage of discourse phenomena, a central issue when continuity in the database consultation carries some priority.",
        "Thus, the ideal NL Front End (NLFE) should carry a broader linguistic coverage, in order to support a user focused query process, combined with a high degree of portability.",
        "In this light, we designed a Discourse Module, which is incorporated into a highly portable NLFE, SQUIRREL (DeRoeck et al., 1991).",
        "The system was originally conceived with a single-query based mode of consultation.",
        "By providing for anaphora and simple cases of ellipsis resolution, the Discourse Module yields continuous consultations without the use of world models (to maintain the system's general portability)."

        "This solution is common practice among NLFEs implementations (eg, LDC-1 (Ballard et al., 1984), Datenbank-DIALOG (Trost et al., 1988)).",
        "However, it is subject to limitations.",
        "In particular, sequences like the following cannot be handled: Query: who works for which salary in shoes?",
        "DB answer: [Malcolm - $5,000.00] Query: who is his boss?",
        "because the resulting query Query: who is the boss of [who works for which salary in shoes] ?",

        "The system consists of a portable Natural Language front end prototype for the interrogation of logical and relational database systems (DeRoeck et al., 1991).",
        "It is divided into two main sections: the Front End and the Back End [Fig.",
        "1].",
        "The Front End takes the input sentence, producing syntactic and semantic representations, which it maps into First Order Logic.",
        "All representations are independent of the domain of application or database model.",
        "Syntactic and semantic rules work in tandem.",
        "The former are a feature-based CFG, whereas the latter are expressed in Property Theory (Turner, 1987).",
        "The lexicon is incomplete, treating unknown words as proper nouns to be fully interpreted when reaching the database.",
        "The Back End uses an Extended Data Model to map the logical representation into expressions in the Domain Relational Calculus (DRC), which is translated via Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC) into SQL (a standard query language) by means of a syntactic transducer.",
        "All representations at this level are domain dependent.",
        "Both the Front End and Back End were designed to guarantee modularity and portability to the system as a whole.",
        "Strict separation between domain dependent and independent components must be maintained for the sake of portability.",
        "The system has no world model embedded in it, and no inference engine.",
        "Only the lexicon and the table-based Extended Data Model have to be customised for a new domain of application.",
        "SQUIRREL maintains three levels of ambiguity, induced by the syntax, the semantics, and the domain.",
        "The Back End has a type checker, which uses the Extended Data Model to resolve ambiguity from the semantic level.",
        "At each level, all possible representations are generated by the system, and tried one at a time.",
        "Only the appropriate ones survive the type checking and the database consultation.",
        "As a consequence, more than one successful answer can be obtained from the same query.",
        "All successful answers are presented to the user, who is in charge of choosing one.",

        "The core of the Discourse Module is the context, a dynamic list of candidate antecedents for anaphoric reference.",
        "The context grows as a stack, i.e., candidates selected from each query and its DB answer are stored on top of the candidates from the previous queries as the consultation evolves.",
        "All candidates are represented in the same format.",
        "Selection of candidates from the query is regulated by rules embedded in the system's grammar, where each syntactic rule has its associated context rule.",
        "Entries are associated with information pertaining to category, number, gender and semantic representation.",
        "Since the lexicon allows open classes (such as proper names, for which no specific lexical entry exists), some of this information may not become available until the query reaches the database.",
        "At this point, a separate database interrogation will supply gender information for proper nouns in the context.",
        "Selecting which items in database answers are added to the context is less straightforward, as no syntactic or semantic information is available concerning a particular answer.",
        "Furthermore, the selection may depend on a specific application and should be a factor for customisation.",
        "As a consequence, information on which entities are to be kept as candidates for reference in the context is encoded in the",
        "Extended Data Model.",
        "Entries are formatted and associated with syntactic and semantic information (on the basis of the characteristics of the database domain from which they are retrieved) and, in cases where the data derives from domains associated with proper nouns, gender is retrieved immediately.",
        "This context grows dynamically and is passed from query to query.",
        "Nevertheless, this structure does not grow indefinitely during the consultation (the context updating mechanism is presented in ยง5.2).",
        "When an anaphor is encountered in a query, a candidate is chosen among the available possible antecedents, and its semantics is inserted in the query's semantic representation, which is then passed to the back end in the normal way.",

        "Clearly, much hinges on an effective process to determine appropriate antecedents.",

        "The operation of the front end must be clear to the user, who must retain the ability to affect the system's decisions.",

        "This scenario has some consequences.",
        "First of all, our strategy aims not to completely resolve an anaphoric reference at all costs, but to present the user with alternatives selected on the basis of reliable system information.",
        "Secondly, to make this process helpful, in a manageable way, the choice of candidates must be focused, intuitively credible, and of limited size."

        "No world model can be introduced without severe consequences for portability.",
        "Segmentation information is not available and cannot be realised in advance since consultation is on-line.",
        "The lack of clues regarding how to segment the dialogue between user and interface, and how to identify the relationships between such segments restricts the possible solutions.",
        "Nonetheless, some domain information is present in the Data Model and can be exploited.",
        "The segmentation process deployed here relies on two potential sources for identifying coherence in relational queries.",
        "First of all, 'meaningful' queries are always associated with a complete access path covering relations and attributes in the database: if we represent the data model as a graph, a meaningful query will always cover a connected subgraph.",
        "This gives us a measure of cohesion within a single query.",
        "Building on this, we can develop a notion of discourse domain covered by successive queries by comparing the access paths involved in them.",
        "To use the graphical analogy as above, a collection of queries covers a discourse domain if their graphs intersect.",
        "Finally, the degree and area of intersection (consulted attributes) may offer information which can be used in the identification of focus.",
        "Candidates for anaphoric reference are grouped in segments, each containing all successive queries which share part of an access path.",
        "The first query starts the first segment of the context.",
        "When a new query is entered, its covered domain is matched against that of the segment on top of the context.",
        "If the intersection is not empty, candidates from the query are added to this segment.",
        "In case the intersection is empty, the system identifies a change of focus on the consultation, and a new segment is started.",
        "In order to allow the user to return to the previous topic after the change of focus occurred, a number of segments are held in the context.",
        "This number can vary from application to application, and the current limit is set to three.",
        "Following Grosz and Sidner (1986), segments occur in sequence, or are embedded, to allow users to elaborate on a change of focus before returning to the previous topic.",
        "In case the current segment intersects with the second most recent one on the context list (if any), this can be seen as a return to the previous topic (segments 1 and 3 in Fig 2).",
