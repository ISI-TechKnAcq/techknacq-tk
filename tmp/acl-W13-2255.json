        "Quality Estimation (QE) aims to provide a quality indicator for machine translated sentences.",
        "There are many cases where such an indicator would be useful in a translation process: to compare different Machine Translation (MT) models on a given set of sentences, to tune automatically the parameters of a MT model, to select the bad sentences for human translation or post-editing, to select the good sentences for immediate publication and try to apply automatic post-editing to the others, or simply to provide users who are not fluent in the source language information about the fluency of 1The second author's submission to subtask 1.1 is independent from this approach and is described in a different paper in this volume.",
        "the translated text they are reading.",
        "As long as machine translated text cannot be of reasonably consistent quality, QE is helpful in indicating linguistic quality variability.2 After focusing on automatic prediction of ad-hoc quality scores (as estimated by professional annotators) in the previous edition (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), the WMT Shared Task on Quality Estimation 2013 proposes several variants of the task.",
        "We participated in task 1.1 which aims to predict HTER scores (edit distance between the MT output and its manually post-edited version), and in task 1.3 which aims to predict the expected time needed to post-edit the MT output.",
        "The originality of our participation lies in the fact that we intended to test ?style classification?",
        "features for the task of QE: the idea is to select a set of n-grams which are particularly representative of a given level of quality.",
        "In practice we use only two levels which simply represent low and high quality.",
        "We explore various ways to build these two reference categories and to select the n-grams, as described in ?2.",
        "The goal was to see if such features can contribute to the task of predicting quality of MT.",
        "As explained in ?3, however, various constraints forced us to somehow cut corners in some parts of the features selection and training process; therefore we think that the modest results presented and discussed in ?4 might not necessarily reflect the real contribution of these features."

        "One or several methods to compare a sentence to a category.",
        "As reference categories we use both the training datasets provided for task 1.1 and 1.3: both are used in each task, that is, categories are extracted from subtasks 1.1 dataset and 1.3 dataset and used in task 1.1 and 1.3 as well.",
        "However we use only half of the sentences of task 1.1 in 1.1 and similarly in 1.3, in order to keep the other half for the classical training process.",
        "This is necessary to avoid using (even indirectly) a sentence as both a fixed parameter from which features are extracted (the category data) and an actual instance on which features are computed.",
        "In other words this simply follows the principle of keeping the training and test data independent, but in this case there are two stages of training (comparing sentences to a reference category is also a supervised process).",
        "The two datasets are used in three different ways, leading to three distinct pairs of categories ?good/bad?",
        ":3 ?",
        "The sentences for which the quality is below the median form the ?bad?",

        "category.",
        "We use these three different ways to build categories because there is no way to determine a priori the optimal choice.",
        "For instance, on the one hand the opposite quartiles probably provide more discriminative power than the medians, but on the other hand the latter contains more data and therefore possibly more useful cases.4 In the last version the idea is to consider that, in average, the machine translated sentences are of poor quality compared to the manually post-edited sentences; in this case the categories contain more data, but it might be a problem that (1) some of the machine-translated sentences are actually good and (2) the",
        "right translation of some difficult phrases in the post-edited sentences might never be found in MT output.",
        "We think that the availability of different categories built in various ways is potentially a good thing, because it lets the learning algorithm decide which features (based on a particular category) are useful and which are not, thus tuning the model automatically while possibly using several possibilities together, rather than relying on some predefined categories.",
        "It is important to notice that the correspondence between an MT output and its post-edited version is not used5: in all categories the sentences are only considered as an unordered set.",
        "For instance it would be possible to use a third-party corpus as well (provided it shares at least a common domain with the data).",
        "We use only the target language (Spanish) of the translation and not the source language in order not to generate too many categories, and because it has been shown that there is a high correlation between the complexity of the source sentence and the fluency of the translation (Moreau and Vogel, 2012).",
        "However it is possible to do so for the categories based on quantiles.",
        "distance measures We use a large set of 30 n-grams patterns based on tokens and POS tags.",
        "POS tagging has been performed with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995).",
        "Various combinations of n-grams are considered, including standard sequential n-grams, skip-grams, and combinations of tokens and POS tags.",
        "Since the goal is to compare a sentence to a category, we consider the frequency in terms of number of sentences in which the n-gram appears, rather than the global frequency or the local frequency by sentence.6 Different frequency thresholds are considered, from 1 to 25.",
        "Additionally we can also filter out n-grams for which the relative frequency is too",
        "count in the following way: instead of considering only the n-gram, we consider a pair (n-gram, local frequency) as an observation.",
        "This way if a particular frequency is observed more often in a given category, it can be interpreted as a clue in favor of this category.",
        "However in most cases (long n-grams sequences) the frequency by sentence is almost always one, sometimes two.",

        "and ?bad?",

        "For instance it is possible to keep only the n-grams for which 80% of the occurrencies belong to the ?bad?",
        "category, thus making it a strong marker for low quality.",
        "Once again different thresholds are considered, in order to tradeoff between the amount of cases and their discriminative power.",
        "We use only three simple distance/similarity measures when comparing a sentence to a category: ?",
        "Binary match: for each n-gram in the sentence, count 1 if it belongs to the category, 0 otherwise, then divide by the number of n-grams in the sentence; ?",
        "Weighted match: same as above but sum the proportion of occurrences belonging to the category instead of 1 (this way an n-gram which is more discriminative is given more",
        "weight); ?",
        "Cosine similarity.",

        "7The number of features depends on the data in the category, because if no n-gram at all in the category satisfies the conditions given by the parameters (which can happen with very high thresholds), then the feature does not exist.",
