        "In this paper we present an approach to unsupervised learning and automatic detection of syllable structure.",
        "The primary goal of the paper is to demonstrate the application of EM-based clustering to multivariate data.",
        "The suitability of this approach is exemplified by the induction of 3 and 5-dimensional probabilistic syllable classes.",
        "A secondary goal is to outline a novel approach to the conversion of graphemes to phonemes (g2p) which uses a context-free grammar (cfg) to generate all sequences of phonemes corresponding to a given orthographic input word and then ranks the hypotheses according to the probabilistic information coded in the syllable classes.",
        "Our approach builds on two resources.",
        "The first resource is a cfg for g2p conversion that was constructed manually by a linguistic expert (Muller, 2000).",
        "The grammar describes how words are composed of syllables and how syllables consist of parts that are conventionally called onset, nucleus and coda, which in turn are composed of phonemes, and corresponding graphemes.",
        "The second resource consists of a multivariate clustering algorithm that is used to reveal syllable structure hidden in unannotated training data.",
        "In a first step, we collect syllables by going through a large text corpus, looking up the words and their syllabifications in a pronunciation dictionary and counting the occurrence frequencies of the syllable types.",
        "Probabilistic syllable classes are then computed by applying maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm.",
        "Two-dimensional EM-based clustering has been applied to tasks in syntax (Rooth et al., 1999), but so far this approach has not been used to derive models of higher dimensionality and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is being applied to speech.",
        "Accordingly, we have trained 3 and 5-dimensional models for English and German syllable structure.",
        "The obtained models of syllable structure were evaluated in three ways.",
        "Firstly, the 3-dimensional models were subjected to a pseudo-disambiguation task, the result of which shows that the onset is the most variable part of the syllable.",
        "Secondly, the resulting syllable classes were qualitatively evaluated from a phonological and phonotactic point of view.",
        "Thirdly, a 5-dimensional syllable model for German was tested in a g2p conversion task.",
        "The results compare well with the best currently available data-driven approaches to g2p conversion (e.g., (Damper et al., 1999)) and suggest that syllable struc",

        "Such systems are critical components in text-to-speech (TTS) conversion systems, and they are also increasingly used to generate pronunciation variants in automatic speech recognition.",

        "Unfortunately, this approach is not applicable to multivariate data with more than two dimensions.",
        "However, we consider syllables to consist of at least three dimensions corresponding to parts of the internal syllable structure: onset, nucleus and coda.",
        "We have also experimented with 5-dimensional models by adding two more dimensions: position of the syllable in the word and stress status.",
        "In our multivariate clustering approach, classes corresponding to syllables are viewed as hidden data in the context of maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm.",
        "The two main tasks of EM-based clustering are (i) the induction of a smooth probability model on the data, and (ii) the automatic discovery of class structure in the data.",
        "Both aspects are considered in our application.",
        "We aim to derive a probability distribution p(y) on syllables y from a large sample.",
        "The key idea is to view y as conditioned on an unobserved class c E C, where the classes are given no prior interpretation.",

        "Note that conditioning of yi on each other is solely made through the classes c via the independence assumptionp(yjc) _ �did_1 p(yijc).",
        "This assumption makes clustering feasible in the first place; later on (in Section 4.1) we will experimentally determine the number jCj of classes such that the assumption is optimally met.",
        "The EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) is directed at maximizing the incomplete data log-likelihood L = j:y p(y) lnp(y) as a function of the probability distribution p for a given empirical probability distribution p. Our application is an instance of the EM-algorithm for context-free models (Baum et al., 1970), from which simple re-estimation formulae can be derived.",

        "In contrast to the application of two-dimensional EM-based clustering to syntax (Rooth et al., 1999), where semantic relations were revealed between verbs and objects, the syllable models cannot a priori be expected to yield similarly meaningful properties.",
        "This is because the syllable constituents (or phones) represent an inventory with a small number of units which can be combined to form meaningful larger units, viz. morphemes and words, but which do not themselves carry meaning.",
        "Thus, there is no reason why certain syllable types should occur significantly more often than others, except for the fact that certain morphemes and words have a higher frequency count than others in a given text corpus.",

        "95 words could not be disambiguated by the 3 resp.",

        "a pseudo-disambiguation task (Section 4.1), the 3-dimensional models confirm the intuition that the onset is the most variable part of the syllable.",
        "In a feasibility study we applied the 5 dimensional syllable model obtained for German to a g2p conversion task.",
        "Automatic conversion of a string of characters, i.e. a word, into a string of phonemes, i.e. its pronunciation, is essential for applications such as speech synthesis from unrestricted text input, which can be expected to contain words that are not in the system's pronunciation dictionary or otherwise unknown to the system.",
        "The main purpose of the feasibility study was to demonstrate the relevance of the phonological information on syllable structure for g2p conversion.",
        "Therefore, information and probabilities derived from an alignment of grapheme and phoneme strings, i.e. the lowest two levels in the trees displayed in Figure 6, was deliberately ignored.",
        "Data-driven pronunciation systems usually rely on training data that include an alignment of graphemes and phonemes.",
        "Damper et al.",
        "(1999) have shown that the use of unaligned training data significantly reduces the performance of g2p systems.",
        "In our experiment, with training on unannotated text corpora and without an alignment of graphemes and phonemes, we obtained a word accuracy rate of 75.3% for the 5-dimensional German syllable model.",
        "Comparison of this performance with other systems is difficult: (i) hardly any quantitative g2p performance data are available for German; (ii) comparisons across languages are hard to interpret; (iii) comparisons across different approaches require cautious interpretations.",
        "The most direct point of comparison is the method presented by Muller (2000).",
        "In one of her experiments, the standard probability model was applied to the hand-crafted cfg presented in this paper, yielding Me word accuracy as evaluated on our test set.",
        "Running the test set through the pronunciation rule system of the IMS German Festival TTS system (Mohler, 1999) resulted in 55% word accuracy.",
        "The Bell Labs German TTS system (Mbius, 1999) performed at better than 94% word accuracy on our test set.",
        "This TTS system relies on an annotation of morphological structure for the words in its lexicon and it performs a morphological analysis of unknown words (Mobius, 1998); the pronunciation rules draw on this structural information.",
        "These comparative results emphasize the value of phonotactic knowledge and information on syllable structure and morphological structure for g2p conversion.",
        "In a comparison across languages, a word accuracy rate of 75.3% for our 5-dimensional German syllable model is slightly higher than the best data-driven method for English with 72% (Damper et al., 1999).",
        "Recently, Bouma (2000) has reported a word accuracy of 92.6% for Dutch, using a `lazy' training strategy on data aligned with the correct phoneme string, and a hand-crafted system that relied on a large set of rule templates and a many-to-one mapping of characters to graphemes preceding the actual g2p conversion.",
        "We are confident that a judicious combination of phonological information of the type employed in our feasibility study with standard techniques such as g2p alignment of training data will produce a pronunciation system with a word accuracy that matches the one reported by Bouma (2000).",
        "We believe, however, that for an optimally performing system as is desired for TTS, an even more complex design will have to be adopted.",
        "In many languages, including English, German and Dutch, access to morphological and phonological information is required to reliably predict the pronunciation of words; this view is further evidenced by the performance of the Bell Labs system, which relies on precisely this type of information.",
        "We agree with Sproat (1998, p. 77) that it is unrealistic to expect optimal results from a system that has no access to this type of information or is trained on data that are insufficient for the task."
