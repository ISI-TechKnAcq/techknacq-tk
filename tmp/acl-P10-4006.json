        "Word space models are based on the contextual distribution in which a word occurs.",

        "Later models have expanded the notion ofco-occurrence but retain the premise that distributional similarity can be used to extract meaningful relationships between words.",
        "Word space algorithms consist of the same core algorithmic steps: word features are extracted from a corpus and the distribution ofthese features is used as a basis for semantic similarity.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the shared algorithmic structure of all the approaches, which is divided into four components: corpus processing, context selection, feature extraction and global vector space operations.",
        "Corpus processing normalizes the input to create a more uniform set of features on which the algorithm can work.",
        "Corpus processing techniques frequently include stemming and filtering of stop words or low-frequency words.",
        "For web-gathered corpora, these steps also include removal of non linguistic tokens, such as html markup, or restricting documents to a single language.",
        "Context selection determines which tokens in a document may be considered for features.",
        "Common approaches use a lexical distance, syntactic relation, or document co-occurrence to define the context.",

        "Feature extraction determines the dimensions of the vector space by selecting which tokens in the context will count as features.",
