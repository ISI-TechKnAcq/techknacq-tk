        "Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has grown to be the largest and most popular knowledge base on the web.",
        "The collaboratively authored content of Wikipedia has grown to include more than 13 million articles in 240 languages.",
        "Of these, there are more than 3 million English articles covering a wide range of subjects, supported by 15 million discussion, disambiguation, and redirect pages.",
        "Wikipedia provides a variety of structured, semi-structured and unstructured resources that can be valuable in areas such information retrieval, information extraction, and natural language processing.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, these resources include page redirects, disambiguation pages, informational summaries (infoboxes), cross-language links between articles covering the same topic, and a hierarchical tree of categories and their mappings to articles.",
        "Many of the Wikipedia pages provide information about concepts and named entities (NE).",
        "Identifying pages that provide information about different NE's can be of great help in a variety of NLP applications such as named entity recognition, question answering, information extraction, and machine translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003; Dakka and Cucerzan, 2008).",
        "This paper attempts to identify multilingual Wikipedia pages that provide information about different types of NE, namely persons, locations, and organizations.",
        "The identification is done using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier that is trained on a variety of Wikipedia features such as infobox attributes, tokens in text, and category links for different languages aided by cross-language links in pages.",
        "Using features from different languages helps in two ways, namely: clues such infobox attributes may exist in one language, but not in the other, and this allows for tagging pages in multiple languages simultaneously.",
        "To improve SVM classification beta-gamma threshold adjustment was used to improve recall of different NE classes and consequently overall F measure.",
        "The separating hyperplane suggested by the SVM typically favors precision at the cost of recall and needs to be translated (via threshold adjustment) to tune for the desired evaluation metric.",
        "Beta-gamma threshold adjustment was generally used when certain classes do not have a sufficient number of training examples, which may lead to poor SVM recall scores (Shanahan and Roma, 2003).",
        "It was used by Shanahan and Roma (2003) to binary classify a set of articles and proved to improve recall with little effect on precision.",
        "However, the technique seems to generalize beyond cases where very few training examples are present, and it is shown in this paper to yield improvements in recall and overall F-measure in the presence of hundreds of training examples, performing better than threshold adjustment using cross validation for the specific task at hand.",
        "The contribution of this paper lies in: introducing a language independent system that utilizes multilingual features from Wikipedia articles in different languages and can be used to effectively classify Wikipedia articles written in any language to the NE classes of types person, location, and organization; and modifying beta-gamma threshold adjustment to improve overall classification quality even when many training examples are available.",
        "The features and techniques proposed in this paper are compared to previous work in the literature.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides information about the structure and feature of Wikipedia; Section 3 surveys prior work on the problem; Section 4 describes the classification approach including features and threshold adjustment algorithm; Section 5 describes the datasets used for evaluation; Section 6 presents the results of the experiments; and Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "As in Figure 2, SVM attempts to find a maximum margin hyperplane that separates positive and negative examples.",
        "The separating hyperplane can be described as follows: <W, X> + b = 0 or £\"=1 wi ■ xi + b, Where W is the normal to the hyperplane, X is an input feature vector, and b is the bias (the perpendicular distance from the origin to the hyperplane).",
        "When the number of examples for each class is not equivalent, the SVM may overfit the class that has fewer training examples.",
        "Further, the SVM training is not informed by the evaluation metric.",
        "Thus, SVM training may lead to a suboptimal separating hyperplane.",
        "Several techniques were proposed to rectify the problem by translating the hyperplane by only adjusting bias b, which is henceforth referred to as threshold adjustment.",
        "Some of these techniques adjust SVM threshold during learning (Vapnik 1998; Lewis 2001), while others consider threshold adjustment as a post learning step (Shanahan and Roma, 2003).",
