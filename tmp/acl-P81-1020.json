        "A preliminary definition: For purposes of providing common ground or possibly a common point of departure at the outset, I will define parsing as the assigning of labelled syntactic structure to an input by applying a grammar that defines syntactically well-formed sentences and phrases.",
        "Note that the question of whether the grammar does other things as well is left open.",
        "In this sense, parsing is distinguished from interpretation, which may take many forms, such as assigning representations in an unambiguous formal language and integrating those representations into a data base or into a hearer's belief system.",

        "(Can we compute an interpretation better without assigning labelled syntactic structures?)",
        "Computational linguists, using available computational equipment that is almost exclusively serial in design, have devised parsing algorithms that involve serial search.",
        "Yet it is obvious that many parts of the parsing process could be done in parallel.",
        "How might notions of parallel processing, VLSI, and the like change our views on parsing?",
        "What might motivate our trying to make parsing procedures simulate human behavior, e.g., by intermixing syntactic with semantic and pragmatic processing?",
        "And for that matter, how do we know what human processing is like?",

        "That discussion may take the form of a debate about the best methods for language processing, but it can also be viewed as a gathering of diverse experiences with orocessing natural language."
