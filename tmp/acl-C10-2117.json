        "However, there is more to \"meaning\" than just propositional content.",
        "Consider the following examples, and suppose we find these sentences in the New York Times:",
        "(1) a. GM will lay off workers.",
        "b.",

        "supposing we consider the Times a trustworthy news source, we would be fairly certain if we read (1a) and (1b).",
        "(1c) suggests the Times is not certain about the layoffs, but considers them possible.",
        "When reading (1d), we know that someone else thinks that GM will lay off workers, but that the Times does not necessarily share this belief.",
        "(1e), (1f), and (1g) do not tell us anything about whether anyone believes whether GM will lay off workers.",
        "In order to tease apart what is happening, we need to abandon a simple view of text as a repository of propositions about the world.",
        "We use two assumptions to aid us.",
        "The first assumption is that discourse participants model each other's cognitive state during discourse (we take the term to include the reading of monologic written text), and that language provides cues for the discourse participants to do the modeling.",
        "This assumption is commonly made, for example by Grice (1975) in his Maxim of Quantity.",
        "Following the literature in Artificial Intelligence (Bratman, 1999; Cohen and Levesque, 1990), we model cognitive state as beliefs, desires, and intentions.",
        "Crucially, these three dimensions are orthogonal; for example, we can desire something but not believe it.",
        "(2) I know John won't be here, but I wouldn't mind if he were",
        "However, we cannot both believe something and not believe it:",
        "(3) #John won't be here, but nevertheless I think he may be here",
        "Note that (2) requires but in order to be felicitous, but sentence (3) cannot be \"saved\" by any discourse markers - it is not interpretable.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in beliefs (and in distinguishing them from desires and intentions).",
        "The second assumption is that communication is intention-driven, and understanding text actually means understanding the communicative intention of the writer.",
        "Furthermore, communicative intentions are intentions to affect the reader's cognitive state - his or her beliefs, desires, and/or intentions.",
        "This view has been adopted in the text generation and dialog community more than in the information extraction and text understanding communities (Mann and Thompson, 1987; Hovy, 1993; Moore, 1994; Bunt, 2000; Stone, 2004).",
        "In this paper we explore the following: we would like to recognize what the writer of the text intends the reader to believe about various people's beliefs about the world (including the writer's own).",
        "In this view, the result of text processing is not a list of facts about the world, but a list of facts about different people's cognitive states.",
        "In this paper, we limit ourselves to the writer's beliefs, but we specifically want to determine which propositions he or she intends us to believe he or she holds as beliefs, and with what strength.",
        "The result of such processing will be a much more fine-grained representation of the information contained in written text than has been available so far."

        "Note also that the syntactic form does not determine the annotation, but the perceived writer's intention - a question will usually be an NA, but sometimes a question can be used to convey a belief (for example, a rhetorical question), in which case it would be labeled CB."

        "Similarly, it contains 6.43% NAs compared to 3.82% across other folds.",
        "However, our best performing model gives a Recall of 59.1% with a Precision of 69.7% (F-measure 64.0%) for Fold-2, which is as good as other folds.",

        "Our work falls in the rich tradition of modeling agents in terms of their cognitive states (for example, (Rao and Georgeff, 1991)) and relating this modeling to language use through extensions to speech act theory (for example, (Perrault and Allen, 1980; Clark, 1996; Bunt, 2000)).",
        "These notions have been particularly fruitful in the dialog community, where dialog act tagging is a major topic of research; to cite just one prominent example: (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "A dialog act represents the communicative intention of the speaker, and its recognition is crucial for the building of dialog systems.",
        "The specific contribution of this paper is to investigate exactly how discourse participants signal their beliefs using language, and the strength of their beliefs; this latter point is not usually included in dialog act tagging.",
        "This paper is not concerned with issues relating to logics for belief representation or inferencing that can be done on beliefs (for an overview, see (McArthur, 1988)), nor theories of automatic belief ascription (Wilks and Ballim, 1987).",
        "For example, this paper is not concerned with determining whether a belief in the requirement of p entails the belief in p; instead, we are only interested in whether the writer wants the reader to understand whether the writer holds a belief in the requirement that p or in p directly.",
        "This paper is also not concerned with subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2004), the nature of the proposition p (statement about interior world or external world) is not of interest, only whether the writer wants the reader to believe the writer believes p. This paper is also not concerned with opinion and determining the polarity (or strength) of opinion (for example: (Somasun-daran et al., 2008)), which corresponds to the desire dimension.",
        "Thus, this work is orthogonal to the extensive literature on opinion classification.",
        "The work of (Saurf and Pustejovsky, 2007; Saurf and Pustejovsky, 2008) is, in many respects, very similar to ours.",
        "They propose Fact-bank, which represents the factual interpretation as modality-polarity pairs, extracted from the basic structural elements denoting factuality encoded by Timebank.",
        "Also, they attribute the factuality to specific sources within the text.",
        "Our work is more limited in several ways: we currently only model the writer's beliefs; we do not express polarity (we believe we can derive it from the syntax and lexicon); Saurf and Pustejovsky (2008) ask their annotators to perform extensive linguistic transformations on the text to obtain a \"normalized\" representation of propositional content (we simply ask the annotators to make a judgment about the writer's strength of belief with respect to a given proposition, and expect to be able to extract representations of pure propositional meaning independently); and finally, Saurf and Pustejovsky (2008) have a more fine-grained representation of non-committed belief.",
        "While it is plausible to distinguish between more or less firm non-committed belief, we believe the crucial distinction is between committed belief and non-committed belief.",
        "Furthermore, Saurf and Pustejovsky (2008) group reported speech with non-belief statements (our NA), while we group them with weak belief (our NCB).",
        "The reason for our decision is that we wanted to keep NA as a category which contains no-one's beliefs, as we assumed this is semantically more coherent.",
        "The category NCB thus covers beliefs which the writer does not hold firmly or has expressed no opinion on – which is different from propositions which the writer has clearly attributed to other cognitive states (such as desire).",
        "In principle, we believe a 4-way distinction is the right approach, but our NCB category is already the least frequent, and splitting it would have resulted in two very rare classes.",
        "Another difference include the use of the word \"fact\" in the FactBank manual, which we avoid because we are interested in cognitive modeling; however, this is merely a terminological issue.",
        "Other related works explored belief systems in an inference scenario as opposed to an intentionality scenario.",
        "In work by (Krestel et al., 2008), the authors explore belief in the context of reported speech in news media: they track newspaper text looking for elements indicating evidentiality.",
        "This is different from our work, since we seek to make explicit the intention of the author or the speaker."

        "We found that the per-sentence F-measure has a small positive correlation with the length-normalized probability of the MICA derivation (a measure of parse confidence).",
