        "Apart from the morphological analysis as in the traditional linguistic sense, morphological segmentation is also widely used as an easy alternative to full fledged morphological analysis.",
        "In this paper we mainly focus on the task of morphological segmentation.",

        "Though both supervised (Koskenniemi, 1983) and unsupervised methods (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2005) are extensively studied for morphological segmentation, unsupervised techniques have the appeal of application to multilingual data with cost effective manner.",
        "Within unsupervised paradigm, various methods have been explored.",

        "In this work, we are mainly going to focus on Bayesian approach.",
        "Bayesian approaches provide natural way of modeling subjective knowledge as well as separating problem specific aspects from general aspects.",

        "guages, the number of morphemes in a word as well as morph length play a major role in morphological process.",
