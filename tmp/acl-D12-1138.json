        "Query spelling correction has become a crucial component in modern information systems.",
        "Particularly, search engine users rely heavily on the query correction mechanism to formulate effective queries.",
        "Given a user query q, which is potentially misspelled, the goal of query spelling correction is to find a correction of the query c that could lead to a better search experience.",
        "A typical query spelling correction system employs a noisy channel model (Kernighan et al. 1990).",
        "The model assumes that the correct query c is formed in the user's mind before entering the noisy channels, e.g., typing, and get misspelled.",
        "Formally, the model maximizes the posterior probability p(c|q):",
        "Applying Bayes rule, the formulation can be rewritten as:",
        "(2) The model uses two probabilities.",
        "The prior probability p(c) represents how likely it is that c is the original correct query in the user's mind.",
        "The probability is usually modeled by a language model estimated from a sizable corpus.",
        "The transformation probability p(q|c) measures how likely it is that q is the output given that c has been formed by the user.",
        "This probability can be either heuristic-based (edit distance) or learned from samples of well aligned corrections.",
        "One problem with the noisy channel model is that there is no weighting for the two kinds of probabilities, and since they are estimated from different sources, there are usually issues regarding their scale and comparability, resulting in suboptimal performance (Gao et al. 2010).",
        "Another limitation of this generative model is that it is not able to take advantage of additional useful features.",
        "A discriminative model may solve these problems by adding the flexibility of using features and applying weights.",
        "But training such a model is not easy.",
        "The difficulty is that the output space of query correction is enormous, as the candidate corrections for each a query term could be the entire vocabulary.",
        "This is even worse when word boundary errors (i.e. merging and splitting of words) exist.",
        "The problem is intractable with standard discriminative models as we cannot enumerate every candidate correction.",
        "To solve the problem, (Gao et al. 2010) proposed a two stage approach.",
        "In this approach, a ranker is trained to score each candidate correction of a query.",
        "When a query is issued, the system first uses the noisy channel model with a standard search algorithm to find the 20 best candidates.",
        "Then the ranker is used to re-rank these candidates and find the best correction for the query.",
        "This ranker based system has one critical limitation, though.",
        "Since the ranking stage is decoupled from the search, it relies on the outsourced search algorithm to find the candidates.",
        "Because query spelling correction is an online operation, only a small number of candidates can enter the ranker due to efficiency concerns, thus limiting the ability of the ranker to the ceiling of recall set by the suboptimal search phase.",
        "The research question we address here is whether we can directly optimize the search phase of query spelling correction using a discriminative model without loss of efficiency.",
        "More specifically, we want 1) a learning process that is aware of the search phase and interacts with its result; 2) an efficient search algorithm that is able to incorporate the learned model and guide the search to the target spelling correction.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new discriminative model for query correction that maintains the advantage of a discriminative model in accommodating flexible combination of features and naturally incorporates an efficient search algorithm in learning and inference.",
        "Similarly to (Chang et al. 2010) we collapse a two stage process into a single discriminatively trained process, by considering the output of the first stage as an intermediate latent representation for the joint learning process.",
        "Specifically, we make use of the latent structural SVM (LS-SVM) (Yu and Joachims, 2009) formulation.",
        "We formulate the problem query spelling correction as a multi-class classification problem on structured inputs and outputs.",
        "The advantage of the structural SVM model is that it allows task specific, customizable solutions for the inference problem.",
        "This allows us to adapt the model to make it work directly with the search algorithm we use for finding the best correction of the query.",
        "To account for word boundary errors, we model the word alignment between the query and the correction as a latent structural variable.",
        "The LS-SVM model allows us to jointly search over the output space and the latent structure space.",
        "As the inference algorithm in the proposed discriminative model we use an algorithm that resembles a traditional noisy channel model.",
        "To adapt the LS-SVM model to enable the efficient search of query spelling correction, we study how features can be designed.",
        "We analyze the properties of features that can be used in the search algorithm and propose a criteria for selecting and designing new features.",
        "We demonstrate the use of the criteria by designing separate features for different types of spelling errors (e.g. splitting, merging).",
        "With the proposed discriminative model, we can directly optimize the search phase of query spelling correction without loss of efficiency.",
        "Our model can be used not only as a standalone speller with high accuracy, but also as a high recall candidate generation stage for a ranker based system.",
        "Experiments verify the effectiveness of the discriminative model, as the accuracy of correction can be improved significantly over baseline systems including an award winning query spelling system.",
        "Even though the optimization is primarily based on the top correction, the weights trained by LS-SVM can be used to search for more candidate corrections.",
        "The improvement in recall at different levels over the noisy channel model demonstrates that our model is superior even when used in the two-stage approach.."

        "This experiment verified the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative model.",
        "As a standalone speller, our system achieves very high accuracy.",
        "Despite we are primarily focused on optimizing the top correction in our discriminative model, we can also use the trained system to output multiple candidate corrections.",

        "In doing so, it actually regularizes the ability of the system in retrieving diversified results.",

        "It is shown that as a standalone speller our system achieves high accuracy.",
        "When used in a two stage approach, it attains higher recall than the noisy channel model and can thus serve as a superior method for candidate generation.",
