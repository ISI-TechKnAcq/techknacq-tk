        "Although current state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems have improved greatly in the last ten years, they are not able to provide the high quality results that are needed for industrial and business purposes.",
        "For that reason, a new interactive paradigm has emerged recently.",
        "In interactive machine translation (IMT) (Foster et al., 1998; Barrachina et al., 2009; Koehn and Haddow, 2009) the system goal is not to produce \"perfect\" translations in a completely automatic way, but to help the user build the translation with the least effort possible.",
        "A typical approach to IMT is shown in Fig. 1.",
        "A source sentence f is given to the IMT system.",
        "First, the system outputs a translation hypothesises in the target language, which would correspond to the output of fully automated MT system.",
        "Next, the user analyses the source sentence and the decoded hypothesis, and validates the longest error-free prefix ep finding the first error.",
        "The user, then, corrects the erroneous word by typing some keystrokes k, and sends them along with ep to the system, as a new validated prefix ep, k. With that information, the system is able to produce a new, hopefully improved, suffixes that continues the previous validated prefix.",
        "This process is repeated until the user agrees with the quality of the resulting translation.",
        "The usual way in which the user introduces the corrections k is by means of the keyboard.",
        "However, other interaction modalities are also possible.",
        "For example, the use of speech interaction was studied in (Vidal et al., 2006).",
        "In that work, several scenarios were proposed, where the user was expected to speak aloud parts of the current hypothesis and possibly one or more corrections.",
        "On-line HTR for interactive systems was first explored for interactive transcription of text images (Toselli et al., 2010).",
        "Later, we proposed an adaptation to IMT in (Alabau et al., 2010).",
        "For both cases, the decoding of the on-line handwritten text is performed independently as a previous step of the suffixes decoding.",
        "To our knowledge, (Alabau et al., 2010) has been the first and sole approach to the use of on-line handwriting in IMT so far.",

        "In the traditional IMT scenario, the user interacts with the system through a series of corrections introduced with the keyboard.",
        "This iterative nature of the process is emphasised by the loop in Fig. 1, which indicates that, for a source sentence to be translated, several interactions between the user and the system should be performed.",
        "In each interaction, the system produces the most probable suffixes that completes the prefix formed by concatenating the longest correct prefix from the previous hypothesis ep and the keyboard correction k. In addition, the concatenation of them, (ep, k, es), must be a translation of f. Statistically, this problem can be formulated as",
        "The multimodal IMT approach differs from Eq.",
        "1 in that the user introduces the correction using a touch-screen or an electronic pen, t. Then, Eq.",
        "1 can be rewritten as",
        "As t is a non-deterministic input (contrarily to k), t needs to be decoded in a word d of the vocabulary.",

        "The last term is an IMT model as described in (Barrachina et al., 2009).",
        "Finally, Pr(d|ep, f ) is a constrained language model.",
        "Note that the language model is conditioned to the longest correct prefix, just as a regular language model.",
        "Besides, it is also conditioned to the source sentence, since d should result of the translation of it.",
        "A typical session of the multimodal IMT is exemplified in Fig. 2.",
        "First, the system starts with an empty prefix, so it proposes a full hypothesis.",
        "The output would be the same of a fully automated system.",
