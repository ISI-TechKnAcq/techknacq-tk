        "Performing textual inference is in the heart of many semantic inference applications such as Question Answering (QA) and Information Extraction (IE).",
        "A prominent generic paradigm for textual inference is Textual Entailment (TUE) (Dagan et al., 2009).",
        "In TUE, the goal is to recognize, given two text fragments termed text and hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text.",
        "For example, the text ?Cyprus was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1571?",
        "implies the hypothesis ?The Ottomans attacked Cyprus?.",
        "Semantic inference applications such as QA and IE crucially rely on entailment rules (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) or equivalently inference rules, that is, rules that describe a directional inference relation between two fragments of text.",
        "An important type of entailment rule specifies the entailment relation between natural language predicates, e.g., the entailment rule ?X invade Y ?",
        "X attack Y?",
        "can be helpful in inferring the aforementioned hypothesis.",
        "Consequently, substantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).",
        "Textual entailment is inherently a transitive relation , that is, the rules ?x ?",
        "y?",
        "and ?y ?",
        "z?",
        "imply the rule ?x ?",
        "z?.",
        "Accordingly, Berant et al. (2010) formulated the problem of learning entailment rules as a graph optimization problem, where nodes are predicates and edges represent entailment rules that respect transitivity.",
        "Since finding the optimal set of edges respecting transitivity is NP-hard, they employed Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to find the exact solution.",
        "Indeed, they showed that applying global transitivity constraints improves rule learning comparing to methods that ignore graph structure.",
        "More recently, Berant et al. (Berant et al., 2011) introduced a more efficient exact algorithm, which decomposes the graph into connected components and then applies an ILP solver over each component.",
        "Despite this progress, finding the exact solution remains NP-hard ?",
        "the authors themselves report they were unable to solve some graphs of rather moderate size and that the coverage of their method is limited.",
        "Thus, scaling their algorithm to data sets with tens of thousands of predicates (e.g., the extractions of Fader et al. (2011)) is unlikely.",
        "In this paper we present a novel method for learning the edges of entailment graphs.",
        "Our method computes much more efficiently an approximate solution that is empirically almost as good as the exact solution.",
        "To that end, we first (Section 3) conjecture and empirically show that entailment graphs exhibit a ?tree-like?",
        "property, i.e., that they can be reduced into a structure similar to a directed forest.",
        "Then, we present in Section 4 our iterative approximation algorithm, where in each iteration a node is removed and reattached back to the graph in a locally-optimal way.",
        "Combining this scheme with our conjecture about the graph structure enables a linear algorithm for node re-attachment.",
        "Section 5 shows empirically that this algorithm is by orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art exact algorithm, and that though an optimal solution is not guaranteed, the area under the precision-recall curve drops by merely a point.",
        "To conclude, the contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we define a novel modeling assumption about the treelike structure of entailment graphs and demonstrate its validity.",
        "Second, we exploit this assumption to develop a polynomial approximation algorithm for learning entailment graphs that can scale to much larger graphs than in the past.",
        "Finally, we note that learning entailment graphs bears strong similarities to related tasks such as Taxonomy Induction (Snow et al., 2006) and Ontology induction (Poon and Domingos, 2010), and thus our approach may improve scalability in these fields as well."

        "Until recently, work on learning entailment rules between predicates considered each rule independently of others and did not exploit global dependencies.",
        "Most methods utilized the distributional similarity hypothesis that states that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Yates and Etzioni, 2009; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).",
        "Some methods extracted rules from lexicographic resources such as WordNet (Szpektor and Dagan, 2009) or FrameNet (Bob and Rambow, 2009; Ben Aharon et al., 2010), and others assumed that semantic relations between predicates can be deduced from their co-occurrence in a corpus via manually-constructed patterns (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "Recently, Berant et al. (2010; 2011) formulated the problem as the problem of learning global entailment graphs.",
        "In entailment graphs, nodes are predicates (e.g., ?X attack Y?)",
        "and edges represent entailment rules between them (?X invade Y ?",
        "X attack Y?).",
        "For every pair of predicates i, j, an entailment score wij was learned by training a classifier over distributional similarity features.",
        "A positive wij indicated that the classifier believes i?",
        "j and a negative wij indicated that the classifier believes i 9 j.",
        "Given the graph nodes V (corresponding to the predicates) and the weighting function w : V ?",
        "V ?",
        "R, they aim to find the edges of a graph G = (V,E) that maximize the objective ?",
        "(i,j)?E wij under the constraint that the graph is transitive (i.e., for every node triplet (i, j, k), if (i, j) ?",
        "E and (j, k) ?",
        "E, then (i, k) ?",
        "E).",
        "Berant et al. proved that this optimization problem, which we term Max-Trans-Graph, is NP-hard, and so described it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP).",
        "Let xij be a binary variable indicating the existence of an edge i ?",
        "j in E. Then, X = {xij :",
        "The objective function is the sum of weights over the edges of G and the constraint xij + xjk ?",
        "xik ?",
        "1 on the binary variables enforces that whenever xij= xjk=1, then also xik = 1 (transitivity).",
        "Since ILP is NP-hard, applying an ILP solver directly does not scale well because the number of variables isO(|V |2) and the number of constraints is O(|V |3).",
        "Thus, even a graph with?80 nodes (predicates) has more than half a million constraints.",
        "Consequently, in (Berant et al., 2011), they proposed a method that efficiently decomposes the graph into smaller components and applies an ILP solver on each component separately using a cutting-plane procedure (Riedel and Clarke, 2006).",
        "Although this method is exact and improves scalability, it does not guarantee an efficient solution.",
        "When the graph does not decompose into sufficiently small components, and the weights generate many violations of",
        "transitivity, solving Max-Trans-Graph becomes intractable.",
        "To address this problem, we present in this paper a method for approximating the optimal set of edges within each component and show that it is much more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically.",
        "Do and Roth (2010) suggested a method for a related task of learning taxonomic relations between terms.",
        "Given a pair of terms, a small graph is constructed and constraints are imposed on the graph structure.",
        "Their work, however, is geared towards scenarios where relations are determined on-the-fly for a given pair of terms and no global knowledge base is explicitly constructed.",
        "Thus, their method easily produces solutions where global constraints, such as transitivity, are violated.",
        "Another approximation method that violates transitivity constraints is LP relaxation (Martins et al., 2009).",
        "In LP relaxation, the constraint xij ?",
        "{0, 1} is replaced by 0 ?",
        "xij ?",
        "1, transforming the problem from an ILP to a Linear Program (LP), which is polynomial.",
        "An LP solver is then applied on the problem, and variables xij that are assigned a fractional value are rounded to their nearest integer and so many violations of transitivity easily occur.",
        "The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph, but nevertheless we show for comparison in Section 5 that our method is much faster.",
        "Last, we note that transitive relations have been explored in adjacent fields such as Temporal Information Extraction (Ling and Weld, 2010), Ontology Induction (Poon and Domingos, 2010), and Co-reference Resolution (Finkel and Manning, 2008)."
