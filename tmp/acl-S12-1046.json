        "all deemed adequate ?",
        "for a target word in context, according to how ?simple?",
        "these substitutes are.",

      "text": [
        "Lexical Simplification is a subtask of Text Simplification (Siddharthan, 2006) concerned with replacing words or short phrases by simpler variants in a context aware fashion (generally synonyms), which can be understood by a wider range of readers.",
        "It generally envisages a certain human target audience that may find it difficult or impossible to understand complex words or phrases, e.g., children, people with poor literacy levels or cognitive disabilities, or second language learners.",
        "It is similar in many respects to the task of Lexical Substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) in that it involves determining adequate substitutes in context, but in this case on the basis of a predefined criterion: simplicity.",
        "A common pipeline for a Lexical Simplification system includes at least three major components: (i) complexity analysis: selection of words or phrases in a text that are considered complex for the reader and/or task at hand; (ii) substitute lookup: search for adequate replacement words or phrases deemed complex in context, e.g., taking synonyms (with the same sense) from a thesaurus or finding similar words/phrases in a corpus using distributional similarity metrics; and (iii) context-based ranking: ranking of substitutes according to how simple they are to the reader/task at hand.",
        "As an example take the sentence: ?Hitler committed terrible atrocities during the second World War.?",
        "The system would first identify complex words, e.g. atrocities, then search for substitutes that might adequately replace it.",
        "A thesaurus lookup would yield the following synonyms: abomination, cruelty, enormity and violation, but enormity should be dropped as it does not fit the context appropriately.",
        "Finally, the system would determine the simplest of these substitutes, e.g., cruelty, and use it to replace the complex word, yielding the sentence: ?Hitler committed terrible cruelties during the second World War.?.",
        "Different from other subtasks of Text Simplification like Syntactic Simplification, which have been relatively well studied, Lexical Simplification has received less attention.",
        "Although a few recent attempts explicitly address dependency on context (de Belder et al., 2010; Yatskar et al., 2010; Biran et al., 2011; Specia, 2010), most approaches are context-independent (Candido et al., 2009; Devlin and Tait, 1998).",
        "In addition, a general deeper understanding",
        "of the problem is yet to be gained.",
        "As a first attempt to address this problem in the shape of a shared task, the English Simplification task at SemEval-2012 focuses on the third component, which we believe is the core of the Lexical Simplification problem.",
        "The SemEval-2012 shared task on English Lexical Simplification has been conceived with the following main purposes: advancing the state-of-the-art Lexical Simplification approaches, and providing a common framework for evaluation of Lexical Simplification systems for participants and other researchers interested in the field.",
        "Another central motive of such a shared task is to bring awareness to the general vagueness associated with the notion of lexical simplicity.",
        "Our hypothesis is that in addition to the notion of a target application/reader, the notion of simplicity is highly context-dependent.",
        "In other words, given the same list of substitutes for a given target word with the same sense, we expect different orderings of these substitutes in different contexts.",
        "We hope that participation in this shared task will help discover some underlying traits of lexical simplicity and furthermore shed some light on how this may be leveraged in future work."

        "Given a short context, a target word in English, and several substitutes for the target word that are deemed adequate for that context, the goal of the English Simplification task at SemEval-2012 is to rank these substitutes according to how ?simple?",
        "they are, allowing ties.",
        "Simple words/phrases are loosely defined as those which can be understood by a wide range of people, including those with low literacy levels or some cognitive disability, children, and non-native speakers of English.",
        "In particular, the data provided as part of the task is annotated by fluent but non-native speakers of English.",
        "The task thus essentially involves comparing words or phrases and determining their order of complexity.",
        "By ranking the candidates, as opposed to categorizing them into specific labels (simple, moderate, complex, etc.",
        "), we avoid the need for a fixed number of categories and for more subjective judgments.",
        "Also ranking enables a more natural and intuitive way for humans (and systems) to perform annotations by preventing them from treating each individual case in isolation, as opposed to relative to each other.",
        "However, the inherent subjectivity introduced by ranking entails higher disagreement among human annotators, and more complexity for systems to tackle."

        "We performed two post hoc evaluations that assess system output from a practical point of view.",
        "We check how well the top-ranked substitute, i.e., the simplest substitute according to a given system (which is most likely to be used in a real simplification task) compares to the top-ranked candidate from the gold standard.",
        "This is reported in the TRnk column of Table 4: the percentage of contexts in which the intersection between the simplest substitute set from a system's output and the gold standard contained at least one element.",
        "We note that while ties are virtually inexistent in the gold standard data, ties in the system output can affect this metric: a system that naively predicts all substitutes as the simplest (i.e., a single tie including all candidates) will score 100% in this metric.",

        "For a given n, we only consider contexts that have at least n+1 candidates in the gold-standard (so that there is some ranking to be done).",
        "Table 4 shows the results of this additional analysis.",
        "These evaluation metrics favour systems that produce many ties.",
        "Consequently the baselines ?L-Sub Gold\" and ?Random\" yield overly high scores for recall-at-n for n=2 and n= 3.",
        "Nevertheless the rest of the results are by and large consistent with the rankings from the kappa metric.",
        "The results for recall-at-2, e.g., show that most systems, on average 70% of the time, are able to find the simplest 2 substitute sets that correspond to the gold standard.",
        "This indicates that most approaches are reasonably good at distinguishing very simple substitutes from very complex ones, and that the top few substitutes will most often produce effective simplifications.",
        "These results correspond to our experience from the comparison of human annotators, who are easily able to form clusters of simplicity with high agreement, but who strongly disagree (based on personal biases towards perceptions of lexical simplicity) on the internal rankings of these clusters."

        "We have presented the organization and findings of the first English Lexical Simplification shared task.",
        "This was a first attempt at garnering interest in the NLP community for research focused on the lexical aspects of Text Simplification.",
        "Our analysis has shown that there is a very strong relation between distributional frequency of words and their perceived simplicity.",
        "The best systems on the shared task were those that relied on this association, and integrated both context-dependent and context-independent features.",
        "Further analysis revealed that while context-dependent features are important in principle, their applied efficacy is somewhat lessened due to the setup of the shared task, which treats simplification as an isolated problem.",
        "Future work would involve evaluating the importance of context for lexical simplification in the scope of a simultaneous simplification to all the words in a context.",
        "In addition, the annotation of the gold-standard datasets could be redone taking into consideration some of the features that are now known to have clearly influenced the large variance observed in the rankings of different annotators, such as their background language and the education level.",
        "One option would be to select annotators that conform a specific instantiation of these features.",
        "This should result in a higher inter-annotator agreement and hence a simpler task for simplification systems."
