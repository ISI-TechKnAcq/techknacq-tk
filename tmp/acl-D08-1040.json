        "Many task-oriented dialogue systems (Liu et al., 2003; Reitter et al., 2006) have been developped.",
        "Research on non-task-oriented dialogue systems like casual conversation dialogue systems (\"chatbots\") is on the other hand not very common, perhaps due to the many amateurs who try to build naturally talking systems using sometimes very clever, but rather unscientific methods although there are systems with chatting abilities as (Bickmore and Cassell, 2001) but concentrate on applying strategies to casual conversation rather than their automatic generation of those conversations.",
        "However, we believe that the main reason is that an unrestricted domain is disproportionately difficult compared to the possible use such a system could have.",
        "It is for example very hard to predict the contents and topics of user utterances, and therefore it is almost impossible to prepare conversational scenarios.",
        "Furthermore, scenarios need more or less specific goals to be useful.",
        "However in our opinion, sooner or later non-task-oriented dialogue systems will have to be combined with task oriented systems and used after recognizing that the user's utterance does not belong to a given task.",
        "This would lead to more natural interfaces for e.g. information kiosks or automatic guides placed in public places where anyone can talk to them about anything (Gustafson and Bell, 2000; Kopp et al., 2005) regardless of the role the developers intended.",
        "For this reason we have also started implementing emotive-ness recognition and joke generation modules that are presented later in the paper.",
        "Well-known examples of non-task-oriented dialogue systems are ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966) and A.L.I.C.E , though the former was built to parody a Rogerian therapist which can be regarded as a task.",
        "Both systems and their countless imitators use a lot of rules coded by hand.",
        "ELIZA is able to make a response to any input, but these responses are only information requests without providing any new information to the user.",
        "In the case of A.L.I.C.E,",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 382-390, Honolulu, October 2008.",

        "the knowledge resource is limited to the existing database.",
        "Creating such databases is costly and a programmer must learn the AIML mark-up language to build it.",
        "Although there have been attempts at updating AIML databases automatically (Pietro et al., 2005), the scale was rather limited.",
        "As mentioned above, these examples and many other \"chatbots\" need hand-crafted rules, and are thus often ignored by computer scientists and rarely become a research topic.",
        "However, they have proved to be useful for e-learning (Pietro et al., 2005) and machine learning (Araki and Kuroda, 2006) support.",
        "Building a system using automatic methods, like we do, seems to be the most realistic way for unrestricted domains.",
        "Considering the large cost of developing a program that can talk about any topic, it is appealing to turn to the huge and cheap textual source that is the Internet.",
        "In this very moment millions of people (Kumar et al., 2003) are updating their blogs and writing articles on every possible topic.",
        "These are available on the Web which we can access any time, and in a faster and faster manner, the search engines grow more and more efficient.",
        "Thus, the Web is well suited to extracting word associations triggered by words from user utterances made in a topic-free dialogue system.. We present a system making use of this type of information.",
        "It automatically extracts word association lists using all keywords in a given utterance without choosing a specific one (which most other systems that ignore the context do) then generates a reply using the only one strongest association from the nouns, verbs and adjectives association groups.",
        "Modality is then added to the reply, and then it is output.",
        "Our system is built upon the idea that human utterances consist of a proposition and a modality (Nitta et al., 1989).",
        "In this paper we present an algorithm for extracting word associations from the Web and a method for adding modality to statements.",
        "We evaluate both the word associations and the use of modality.",
        "We also suggest some future possible extensions of the system and show a small experiment with adding humor to the system.",
        "In this paper, the system described works for Japanese and uses text as input and output.",
        "Though the final goal of our research is to help developing freely talking car navigation systems that by their chatting abilities can help to avoid drowsiness while driving and so on.",
        "in this part of the development we concentrate on proposition generation and modality processing.",

        "In this chapter, we present a method for automatic extraction of word associations based on keywords from user utterances.",
        "We use the Google search engine snippets to extract word associations in real time without using earlier prepared resources, such as off-line databases.",
        "In the first step, the system analyzed user utterances using the morphological analyzer MeCab in order to spot query keywords for extracting word associations lists.",
        "We define nouns, verbs, adjectives, and unknown words as query keywords.",
        "The reason we chose these word classes is that these word classes can be treated as important and, to some extent, describe the context.",
        "We define a noun as the longest set of nouns in a compound noun.",
        "For example, the compound noun shizen gengo shori (natural language processing) is treated by MeCab as three words: (shizen - natural), (gengo - language) and (shori - processing).",
        "Our system, however, threats it as one noun.",
        "In the next step, the system uses these keywords as query words for the Google search engine.",
        "The system extracts the nouns from the search results and sorts them in frequency order.",
        "This process is based on the idea that words which co-occur frequently with the input words are of high relevance to them.",
        "The number of extracted snippets is 500.",
        "This value was set experimentally, taking the processing time and output quality into account.",
        "The top ten words of a list are treated as word associations, see Table 1 for an example.",

        "(Sapporo city is cold.)",
        "Association frequency ranking:",
        "We asked volunteers to use our system and to evaluate the correctness of word lists generated by the system.",
        "First, a participant freely inputs an utterance, for which the system retrieves ten association words.",
        "Next, a participant rated these words using a scale of one to three with 3 meaning \"perfectly correct\", 2 -\"partially correct\" and 1 - \"incorrect\".",
        "In this experiment we consider words that receive a 2 or 3 as usable.",
        "The reason associations rated 2 or 3 are considered as usable is that the definition of what makes a good word association here is difficult to specify.",
        "When it comes to topic-free conversations we have observed that associations have an effect on a certain context.",
        "Three volunteers repeated the experiment ten times, so the final amount of evaluated words was 300.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of the top 10 words, sorted by the frequency of appearance.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of the top 5 words.",
        "What constitutes a correct word association was left to each volunteer to decide subjectively since in a casual conversation setting associations are hard to define strictly.",
        "As shown in Table 2 approximately 77% of the word associations were judged as usable but there were individual differences between the evaluators.",
        "This shows that the definition of word associations is different for each participant.",
        "Table 3 shows that approximately 80% of the word associations were judged as usable.",
        "It is thus highly likely that the top words from the frequency lists are correct associations.",
        "The results show that automatic extracting of word associations using a Web search engine is feasible.",
        "The main reason for extracting word associations from the Web is that thanks to this method, the system can handle new information, proper names, technical terms and so on.",
        "by using only the snippets from the search engine.",
        "The word association extraction takes no more than few seconds.",
        "For the evaluation we used only nouns but we expect although verbs and adjectives are often more abstract than nouns, the word associations for them will improve the results."

        "A system constructed on the basis of their method achieved human level performance in determining the emo-tiveness of utterances, and 65% of human level performance in extracting the specific types of emotions.",
        "Also, the supporting Web mining technique improved the performance of the emotional state type extraction to 85% of the human level (Shi et al., 2008).",
        "As these are very promising figures we are currently in the phase of implementing their ideas in our system and testing how emotion recognition can influence speech act analysis and the automatic choice of proper modality.",
        "In this trial, an experiment showing that humor can improve a non-task oriented conversational system's overall performance was conducted.",
        "By using a simplified version of Dybala's PUNDA system (Dybala et al., 2008), a pun-generation was added to our baseline system.",
        "The PUNDA algorithm consists of two parts: A Candidate Selection Algorithm and a Sentence Integration Engine.",
        "The former generates a candidate for a pun analyzing an input utterance and selects words or phrases that could be transformed into a pun by one of four generation patterns: homophony, initial mora addition, internal mora addition or final mora addition.",
        "The latter part generates a sentence including the candidate extracted in the previous step.",
        "To make the system's response more related to the user's input, each sentence that included a joke started with the pattern \"[base phrase] to ieba\" (\"Speaking of [base phrase]\").",
        "The remaining part of the sentence was extracted from the Web and the candidate was used as a query word and the list of sentences including this word was retrieved.",
        "Then the shortest sentence with an exclamation mark is selected as most jokes convey some emotions.",
        "When the candidate list was empty, the system selected one random pun from a pun database.",
        "In the first experiment, 5 participants were asked to perform a 10-turn dialogue with two systems.",
        "After using both systems (baseline and humor-equipped), users were asked to evaluate both sys-tems's performances by answering the following questions: A) Do you want to continue the dialogue?",
        "; B) Was the system's utterances grammatically natural?",
        "; C) Was the system's utterances semantically natural?",
        "; D) Was the system's vocabulary rich?",
        "; E) Did you get an impression that the system possesses any knowledge?",
        "; F) Did you get an impression that the system was human-like?",
        "; G) Do you think the system tried to make the dialogue more funny and interesting?",
        "and H) Did you find the system's utterances interesting and funny?",
        "Answers were given on a 5-point scale and the results are shown in Table 9.",
        "A third-person evaluation experiment was also performed and again the humor-equipped system scored higher than the non-humor one.",
        "The question asked in this evaluation was: \"Which dialogue do you find most interesting and funny?\".",
        "Evaluators could choose between 3 options: Dialogue 1 (Baseline system first 3 turns), Dialogue 2 (Humor-equipped system, first 3 turns with system's third response replaced by pun generator's output) and Dialogue 3 (the first 3 turns of the baseline system with joking ability).",
        "Dialogue 1 and Dialogue 2 have the same input.",
        "Among 25 evaluators, only 5 (20%) responded that Dialogue 1 was most interesting and funny.",
        "10 chose Dialogue 2 and the other 10 chose Dialogue 3 (40% respectively).",
        "This means that each of humor equipped dialogues received evaluations two times higher than non-humor dialogue.",

        "In this research we investigated if word associations extracted automatically from the Web are reasonable (semantically on topic) and if they can be successfully used in non-task-oriented dialogue systems.",
        "We also implemented such a system extraction module.",
        "It is able to automatically generate in real-time responses to user utterances by generating a proposition and adding modality retrieved from IRC chat logs.",
        "We conducted evaluation experiments on the overall influence of the modality usage and it improved the system.",
        "Therefore we showed that it is possible to construct a dialogue system that automatically generates understandable on-topic utterances without the need of creating vast amounts of rules and data beforehand.",
        "We also confirmed that our system can be used as a experimental platform which can be easily used by other researchers to test their algorithms with a more unpredictible (and less boring) \"chatbot\", an important factor for long tiring sessions of human-computer conversation.",
        "Currently there are several projects which use the system described here as a platform for experiments and we introduced two of them - on joke generation and affect analysis.",
        "There is still a lot of work left to be done.",
        "It is necessary for a non-task-oriented dialogue system to obtain not only word associations, but also different kinds of knowledge - of user's preferences or of dialogue itself - for example conversational strategies.",
        "At this moment the system generates utterances by applying word associations to the proposition templates and adding modality.",
        "We also need to more deeply consider semantics, speech acts and context to create a more advanced system.",
        "Finally, the system needs to recognize not only keywords, but also user's modality.",
        "We assume that the affect recognition mentioned above will help us to achieve this goal in near future and this is our next step.",
        "By opening the system's code and giving others the opportunity of adding their own modules and changes we hope to solve remaining problems.",
        "In this paper we focus on the impact of adding modality to a system.",
        "Comparing the system to Japanese versions of ELIZA (already available) and ALICE (not available in Japanese yet) is also one of our next steps.",
