        "Over the last twelve years, research in Psychology and AI into narrative structure has been marked by acrimonious disputes over the right to existence of the \"story grammar\" approach.",
        "The point at issue is whether it is possible, as story grammarians suggest, to identify structural regularities particular to narrative texts (Mandler and Johnson, 1980; Pemberton, 1987; Shen, 1988), or whether any structural regularities should be interpreted rather as world knowledge, usable in contexts other than stories (Gamham, 1983; Wilensky, 1980; Yazdani, 1982).",
        "The work described in this paper adopts the story grammarian position, arguing that a general model of story structure may be used, in conjunction with, but separate from, a model of the \"story world\", to generate stories.",
        "Moreover, a fuller version of such an account of story generation must draw not only on the general story structure model and the story world model, but also on aspects of the audience, the author, the medium of expression and the cultural context."

      "text": [
        "People are able to categorise texts into types, according to the global conditions of coherence which they perceive at work in texts.",
        "Knowledge of the particular structures of each text type is an element of the cultural competence of the speaker/hearer, enabling him/her to process varieties of cultural artefact such as jokes, sermons, weather reports, sets of instructions and so on, in appropriate ways (Ryan, 1981).",
        "Often, especially in \"realistic\" texts, it may seem that these conditions of coherence are reducible to the everyday concepts which we use to analyse aspects of the real world, especially notions such as plans, goals and intentions.",
        "On the other hand, the fact that the same real world events, e.g. a road accident, or a bank robbery, may be represented in texts of widely different types, such as a newspaper article, a telegram message, a joke, or a conversational anecdote, indicates that structuring models, in addition to those imposed by the structure of the content, are at work in texts.",
        "Such models facilitate the processing of texts, creating certain expectations when we recognise a text as an instance of a particular genre, and providing a set of patterns to guide the creation of new instances.",
        "Text types interact in complex ways with the other categorial features of texts, such as content, speaker type, speech situation, register and speech act identity.",
        "Sometimes, text types are highly constrained in this regard.",
        "For example, conventionally a text of the \"sermon\" genre is uttered in the \"church service\" speech situation, in a formal register: it is normally produced only by a priest-figure, and often serves as a \"warning\" or \"exhortation\" speech act.",
        "Texts of the story genre are not tightly linked to any such characteristics: they may be expressed by anyone, in any register, in almost any speech situation, and, while their illocutionary force is essentially \"assertion\", their intended perlocutionary forces may be many and varied.",
        "However, sub-genres such as the detective story, the narrative ballad, the traditional folk tale and so on, will impose further constraints of their own."

        "As this discussion of genre theory implies, story structure cannot be discussed in isolation from a variety of other constraints.",
        "A theory of story structure for the purposes of text generation must be situated within a broader theory of story production, which can perhaps best be described in terms of the sorts of knowledge which contribute to the creation of a story.",
        "A full story generating system would need access to many different kinds of separate but interacting knowledge.",
        "These would include knowledge of:",
        "(a) story structure (b) the audience (c) the author (d) the cultural context (e) the rules of the sub-genre",
        "Knowledge of the audience will influence what information should be included in the text and what can be taken as read.",
        "Characteristics of the author may lead, for instance, to choices which give a particular perlocutionary force to the text: a moralist might insist on a fictional wrongdoer coming to a sticky end, where a cynic might let him/her go unpunished.",
        "The cultural context refers to the socio-historical setting in which the text is produced, which restricts the particular sub-genres available: tales of saints' lives, for instance, all the rage in the Twelfth Century, are now out of vogue and so virtually \"untellable\".",
        "The rules of the sub-genre will place constraints not only on the content of the text, but also on the choice of expressive medium and on stylistic choices within the expressive medium: verse will be fine for a narrative ballad, inappropriate for a detective story.",

        "The textual level, which is not included in the study, may be thought of as the lexicalised version of the layer of analysis referred to as discourse.",

        "There are two types of motivation: general motivation looks back to the initial situation, while specific motivation looks forward to the action which will end the initial situation.",
        "An everyday example will illustrate this distinction: a person who is hungry will have a general motivation to end that state of hunger, but only when confronted with the sight of, say, a loaf of bread, will s/he acquire the specific motivation to end the undesirable state by an action.",
        "The stimuli which bring about general and specific motivation are referred to as motivating acts.",
        "The plan phase consists of the subject's acquisition of the knowledge needed to perform the main act: this knowledge is acquired via one or more informing acts.",
        "Similarly, qualification is the process of acquiring the power, material or physical, to carry out the main act, via a series of qualifying acts.",
        "The action is the subject's attempt to obtain the object, while resolution is the phase in which the success or failure of the action is made clear, determining whether the final situation is to be a negation or a reaffirmation of the initial state.",
        "Within this scheme, recursion allows for several attempts to be made on the same goal, or for a new goal to be set.",
        "The terminal elements of this grammar of the narrative model are narrative motifs, which, when instantiated, will make up the chronological flow of the text.",
