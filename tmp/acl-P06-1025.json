        "Designing a spoken dialogue system involves many non-trivial decisions.",
        "One factor that the designer has to take into account is the presence of speech recognition problems (SRP).",
        "Previous work (Walker et al., 2000) has shown that the number of SRP is negatively correlated with overall user satisfaction.",
        "Given the negative impact of SRP, there has been a lot of work in trying to understand this phenomenon and its implications for building dialogue systems.",
        "Most of the previous work has focused on lower level details of SRP: identifying components responsible for SRP (acoustic model, language model, search algorithm (Chase, 1997)) or prosodic characterization of SRP (Hirschberg et al., 2004).",
        "We extend previous work by analyzing the relationship between SRP and higher level dialogue factors.",
        "Recent work has shown that dialogue design can benefit from several higher level dialogue factors: dialogue acts (Frampton and Lemon, 2005; Walker et al., 2001), pragmatic plausibility (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004).",
        "Also, it is widely believed that user emotions, as another example of higher level factor, interact with SRP but, currently, there is little hard evidence to support this intuition.",
        "We perform our analysis on three high level dialogue factors: frustration/anger, certainty and correctness.",
        "Frustration and anger have been observed as the most frequent emotional class in many dialogue systems (Ang et al., 2002) and are associated with a higher word error rate (Bulyko et al., 2005).",
        "For this reason, we use the presence of emotions like frustration and anger as our first dialogue factor.",
        "Our other two factors are inspired by another contribution of our study: looking at speech-based computer tutoring dialogues instead of more commonly used information retrieval dialogues.",
        "Implementing spoken dialogue systems in a new domain has shown that many practices do not port well to the new domain (e.g. confirmation of long prompts (Kearns et al., 2002)).",
        "Tutoring, as a new domain for speech applications (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2004), brings forward new factors that can be important for spoken dialogue design.",
        "Here we focus on certainty and correctness.",
        "Both factors have been shown to play an important role in the tutoring process (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2005; Liscombe et al., 2005).",
        "A common practice in previous work on emotion prediction (Ang et al., 2002; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) is to transform an initial finer level emotion annotation (five or more labels) into a coarser level annotation (2-3 labels).",
        "We wanted to understand if this practice can im",
        "pact the dependencies we observe from the data.",
        "To test this, we combine our two emotion1 factors (frustration/anger and certainty) into a binary emotional/non-emotional annotation.",
        "To understand the relationship between SRP and our three factors, we take a three-step approach.",
        "In the first step, dependencies between SRP and our three factors are discovered using the Chi Square (χ2) test.",
        "Similar analyses on human-human dialogues have yielded interesting insights about human-human conversations (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2005; Skantze, 2005).",
        "In the second step, significant dependencies are combined to produce interesting insights regarding SRP and to propose strategies for handling SRP.",
        "Validating these strategies is the purpose of the third step.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the first two steps; the third step is left as future work.",
        "Our analysis produces several interesting insights and strategies which confirm the utility of the proposed approach.",
        "With respect to insights, we show that user emotions interact with SRP.",
        "We also find that incorrect/uncertain student turns have more SRP than expected.",
        "In addition, we find that the emotion annotation level affects the interactions we observe from the data, with finer-level emotions yielding more interactions and insights.",
        "In terms of strategies, our data suggests that favoring misrecognitions over rejections (by lowering the rejection threshold) might be more beneficial for our tutoring task – at least in terms of reducing the number of emotional student turns.",
        "Also, as a general design practice in the spoken tutoring applications, we find an interesting tradeoff between the pedagogical value of asking difficult questions and the system’s ability to recognize the student answer."

        "When interacting with ITSPOKE, students first type an essay answering a qualitative physics problem using a graphical user interface.",

        "The Frustration/Anger/Hyperarticulation dimension captures the perceived negative student emotional response to the interaction with the system.",
        "Three labels were used to annotate this dimension: frustration-anger, hyperarticulation and neutral.",
        "Similar to (Ang et al., 2002), because frustration and anger can be difficult to distinguish reliably, they were collapsed into a single label: frustration-anger (Figure 1, STD4).",
        "Often, frustration and anger is prosodically marked and in many cases the prosody used is consistent with hyperarticulation (Ang et al., 2002).",
        "For this reason we included in this dimension the hyperarticulation label (even though hyperarticulation is not an emotion but a state).",
        "We used the hyperarticulation label for turns where no frustration or anger was perceived but nevertheless were hyperarticulated.",
        "For our interaction experiments we define the FAH variable with three values: FrAng (frustration-anger), Hyp (hyperarticulation) and Neutral.",
        "The Certainty dimension captures the perceived student reaction to the questions asked by our computer tutor and her overall reaction to the tutoring domain (Liscombe et al., 2005).",
        "(Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2005) show that student certainty interacts with a human tutor’s dialogue decision process (i.e. the choice of feedback).",
        "Four labels were used for this dimension: certain, uncertain (e.g.",
        "Figure 1, STD1), mixed and neutral.",
        "In a small number of turns, both certainty and uncertainty were expressed and these turns were labeled as mixed (e.g. the student was certain about a concept, but uncertain about another concept needed to answer the tutor’s question).",
        "For our interaction experiments we define the CERT variable with four values: Certain, Uncertain, Mixed and Neutral.",
        "To test the impact of the emotion annotation level, we define the Emotional/Non-Emotional annotation based on our two emotional dimensions: neutral turns on both the FAH and the CERT dimension are labeled as neutral2; all other turns were labeled as emotional.",

        "A similar effect was observed in our previous work (Rotaru and Litman, 2005).",
        "The fact that it generalizes across annotation scheme and corpus, emphasizes its importance.",
        "When a finer level annotation is used, we find that rejections are followed more than expected by a frustrated, angry and hyperarticulated user (Table 6).",
        "Moreover, these subsequent turns can result in additional rejections (Table 3).",
        "Asking to repeat after a rejection does not also help in terms of correctness: the subsequent student answer is actually incorrect more than expected (Table 6).",
        "These interactions suggest an interesting strategy for our tutoring task: favoring misrecognitions over rejections (by lowering the rejection threshold).",
        "First, since rejected turns are more than expected incorrect (Table 5), the actual recognized hypothesis for such turns turn is very likely to be interpreted as incorrect.",
        "Thus, accepting a rejected turn instead of rejecting it will have the same outcome in terms of correctness: an incorrect answer.",
        "In this way, instead of attempting to acquire the actual student answer by asking to repeat, the system can skip these extra turn(s) and use the current hypothesis.",
        "Second, the other two SRP are less taxing in terms of eliciting FAH emotions (recall Table 6; note that a SemMis might activate an unwarranted and lengthy knowledge remediation subdialogue).",
        "This suggests that continuing the conversation will be more beneficial even if the system misunderstood the student.",
        "A similar behavior was observed in human-human conversations through a noisy speech channel (Skantze, 2005)."

        "Intuitively, asking a more complicated question when the student is not prepared to answer it will increase the likelihood of an incorrect or uncertain answer.",

        "This suggests an interesting tradeoff between the tutor’s question difficulty and the system’s ability to recognize the student answer.",

        "In this paper we analyze the interactions between SRP and three higher level dialogue factors that define our notion of student state: frustration/anger/hyperarticulation, certainty and correctness.",
        "Our analysis produces several interesting insights and strategies which confirm the",
        "utility of the proposed approach.",
        "We show that user emotions interact with SRP and that the emotion annotation level affects the interactions we observe from the data, with finer-level emotions yielding more interactions and insights.",
        "We also find that tutoring, as a new domain for speech applications, brings forward new important factors for spoken dialogue design: certainty and correctness.",
        "Both factors interact with SRP and these interactions highlight an interesting design practice in the spoken tutoring applications: the tradeoff between the pedagogical value of asking difficult questions and the system’s ability to recognize the student answer (at least in our system).",
        "The particularities of the tutoring domain also suggest favoring misrecognitions over rejections to reduce the negative impact of asking to repeat after rejections.",
        "In our future work, we plan to move to the third step of our approach: testing the strategies suggested by our results.",
        "For example, we will implement a new version of ITSPOKE that never rejects the student turn.",
        "Next, the current version and the new version will be compared with respect to users’ emotional response.",
        "Similarly, to test the tradeoff hypothesis, we will implement a version of ITSPOKE that asks difficult questions first and then falls back to simpler questions.",
        "A comparison of the two versions in terms of the number of SRP can be used for validation.",
        "While our results might be dependent on the tutoring system used in this experiment, we believe that our findings can be of interest to practitioners building similar voice-based applications.",
        "Moreover, our approach can be applied easily to studying other systems."
