        "Sentiment analysis (also called opinion mining) has been an active research area in recent years.",

        "2008).",
        "Formal definitions of different aspects of the sentiment analysis problem and discussions of major research directions and algorithms can be found in (Liu, 2006; Liu, 2009).",
        "A comprehensive survey of the field can be found in (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Our work is in the area of topic/feature-based sentiment analysis or opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "The existing research focuses on solving the general problem.",
        "However, we argue that it is unlikely to have a one-technique-fit-all solution because different types of sentences express sentiments/opinions in different ways.",
        "A divide-and-conquer approach is needed, e.g., focused studies on different types of sentences.",
        "This paper focuses on one type of sentences, i.e., conditional sentences, which have some unique characteristics that make it hard to determine the orientation of sentiments on topics/features in such sentences.",
        "By sentiment orientation, we mean positive, negative or neutral opinions.",
        "By topic, we mean the target on which an opinion has been expressed.",
        "In the product domain, a topic is usually a product feature (i.e., a component or attribute).",
        "For example, in the sentence, I do not like the sound quality, but love the design of this MP3 player, the product features (topics) are \"sound quality\" and \"design\" of the MP3 player as opinions have been expressed on them.",
        "The sentiment is positive on \"design\" but negative on \"sound quality\".",
        "Conditional sentences are sentences that describe implications or hypothetical situations and their consequences.",
        "In the English language, a variety of conditional connectives can be used to form these sentences.",

        "Â©2009 ACL and AFNLP",
        "the consequent clause, that are dependent on each other.",
        "Their relationship has significant implications on whether the sentence describes an opinion.",
        "One simple observation is that sentiment words (also known as opinion words) (e.g., great, beautiful, bad) alone cannot distinguish an opinion sentence from a non-opinion one.",
        "A conditional sentence may contain many sentiment words or phrases, but express no opinion.",
        "Example 1: If someone makes a beautiful and reliable car, I will buy it expresses no sentiment towards any particular car, although \"beautiful\" and \"reliable\" are positive sentiment words.",
        "This, however, does not mean that a conditional sentence cannot express opinions/sentiments.",
        "Example 2: If your Nokia phone is not good, buy this great Samsung phone is positive about the \"Samsung phone\" but does not express an opinion on the \"Nokia phone\" (although the owner of the \"Nokia phone\" may be negative about it).",
        "Clearly, if the sentence does not have \"if, the first clause is negative.",
        "Hence, a method for determining sentiments in normal sentences will not work for conditional sentences.",
        "The examples below further illustrate the point.",
        "In many cases, both the condition and consequent together determine the opinion.",
        "Example 3: If you are looking for a phone with good voice quality, don't buy this Nokia phone is negative about the \"voice quality\" of the \"Nokia phone\", although there is a positive sentiment word \"good\" in the conditional clause modifying \"voice quality\".",
        "However, in the following example, the opinion is just the opposite.",
        "Example 4: If you want a phone with good voice quality, buy this Nokia phone is positive about the \"voice quality\" of the \"Nokia phone\".",
        "As we can see, sentiment analysis of conditional sentences is a challenging problem.",
        "One may ask whether there is a large percentage of conditional sentences to warrant a focused study.",
        "Indeed, there is a fairly large proportion of such sentences in evaluative text.",
        "They can have a major impact on the sentiment analysis accuracy.",
        "Table 1 shows the percentage of conditional sentences (sentences containing the words if, unless, assuming, etc) and also the total number of sentences from which we computed the percentage in several user-forums.",
        "The figures definitely suggest that there is considerable benefit to be gained by developing techniques that can analyze conditional sentences.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no focused study on conditional sentences.",
        "This paper makes such an attempt.",
        "Specifically, we determine whether a conditional sentence (which is also called a conditional in the linguistic literature) expresses positive, negative or neutral opinions on some topics/features.",
        "Since our focus is on studying how conditions and consequents affect sentiments, we assume that topics are given, which are product attributes since our data sets are user comments on different products.",
        "Our study is conducted from two perspectives.",
        "We start with the linguistic angle to gain a good understanding of existing work on different types of conditionals.",
        "As conditionals can be expressed with other words or phrases than if, we will study how they behave compared to if.",
        "We will also show that the distribution of these conditionals based on our data sets.",
        "With the linguistic knowledge, we perform a computational study using machine learning.",
        "A set of features for learning is designed to capture the essential determining information.",
        "Note that the features here are data attributes used in learning rather than product attributes or features.",
        "Three classification strategies are designed to study how to best perform the classification task due to the complex situation of two clauses and their interactions in conditional sentences.",
        "These three classification strategies are clause-based, consequent-based and whole-sentence-based.",
        "Clause-based classification classifies each clause separately and then combines their results.",
        "Consequent-based classification only uses consequents for classification as it is observed that in conditional sentences, it is often the consequents that decide the opinion.",
        "Whole-sentence-based classification treats the entire sentence as a whole in classification.",
        "Experimental results on conditional sentences from diverse domains demonstrate the effectiveness of these classification models.",
        "The results indicate that the whole-sentence-based classifier performs the best.",
        "Since this paper only studies conditional sentences, a natural question is whether the proposed technique can be easily integrated into an overall sentiment analysis or opinion mining system.",
        "The answer is yes because a large proportion of conditional sentences can be detected using conditional connectives.",
        "Keyword search is thus sufficient to identify such sentences for special handling using the proposed approach.",

        "Unless: Most conditional sentences containing unless can be replaced with equivalent sentences with an if and a not.",
        "For example, the sentence Unless you need clarity, buy the cheaper model can be expressed with If you don't need clarity, buy the cheaper model.",
        "Even if: Linguistic theories claim that even if is a special case of a conditional which may not always imply an if-then relationship (Gauker 2005).",
        "However, in our datasets, we have observed that the usage of even if almost always translates into a conditional.",
        "Replacing even if by if will yield a sentence that is semantically similar enough for the purpose of sentiment analysis.",
        "Only if, provided/providing that, on condition that: Conditionals involving these phrases typically express a necessary condition, e.g., I will buy this camera only if they can reduce the price.",
        "In such sentences, only usually does not affect whether the sentence is opinionated or not.",
        "In case: Conditional sentences containing in case usually describe a precaution (I will close the window in case it rains), prevention (I wore sunglasses in case I was recognized), or a relevance conditional (In case you need a car, you can rent one).",
        "Identifying the conditional and consequent clauses is not straightforward in many cases.",
        "Further, in these instances, replacing in case with if may not convey the intended meaning of the conditional.",

        "However, these classifications are mainly based on semantic meanings which are difficult to recognize by a computer program.",
        "To build classification models, we instead exploit canonical tense patterns of conditionals, which are often used in pedagogic grammar books.",
        "They are defined based on tense and are associated with general meanings.",

        "As we will see in Section 5, canonical tense patterns help sentiment classification significantly.",

        "Zero Conditional: This conditional form is used to describe universal statements like facts, rules and certainties.",
        "In a zero conditional, both the condition and consequent clauses are in the simple present tense.",
        "An example of such sentences is: If you heat water, it boils.",
        "First Conditional: Conditional sentences of this type are also called potential or indicative conditionals.",
        "They are used to express a hypothetical situation that is probably true, but the truth of which is unverified.",
        "In the first conditional, the condition is in the simple present tense, and the consequent can be either in past tense or present tense, usually with a modal auxiliary verb preceding the main verb, e.g., If the acceleration is good, I will buy it.",
        "Second Conditional: This is usually used to describe less probable situations, for stating preferences and imaginary events.",
        "The condition clause of a second conditional sentence is in the past subjunctive (past tense), and the consequent clause contains a conditional verb modifier (like would, should, might), in addition to the main verb, e.g., If the cell phone was robust, I would consider buying it.",
        "Third conditional: This is usually used to describe contrary-to-fact (impossible) past events.",
        "The past perfect tense is used in the condition clause, and the consequent clause is in the present perfect tense, e.g., If I had bought the a767, I would have hated it.",
        "Based on the above definitions, we have developed approximate part-of-speech (POS) tags for the condition and the consequent of each pattern (Table 3), which do not cover all sentences, but overall they cover a majority of the sentences.",
        "For those not covered cases, the problem is mainly due to incomplete sentences and wrong grammars, which are typical for informal writings in forum postings and blogs.",
        "For example, the sentence, Great car if you need powerful acceleration, does not fall into any category, but it actually means It is a great car if you need powerful acceleration, which is a zero conditional.",

        "Our data consists of conditional sentences from 5 different user forums: Cellphone, Automobile, LCD TV, Audio systems and Medicine.",
        "We obtained user postings from these forums and extracted the conditional sentences.",
        "We then manually annotated 1378 sentences from this corpus.",
        "We also annotated the conditional and consequent clauses and identified the topics (or product features) being commented upon, and their sentiment orientations.",
        "In our annotation, we observed that sentences with no sentiment words or phrases almost never express opinions, i.e., only around 3% of them express opinions.",
        "There are around 26% sentences containing no sentiment words or phrases in our data.",
        "To make the problem challenging, we restrict our attention to only those sentences that contain at least one sentiment word or phrase.",
        "We have annotated topics from around 900 such sentences.",
        "Table 4 shows the class distributions of this data.",
        "At the clause level (topics are not considered), we observe that conditional clauses contain few opinions.",
        "At the topic-level, 43.5% of the topics have positive opinions, 26.4% of the topics have negative opinions, and the rest have no opinions.",
        "For the annotation of data, we assume that topics are known.",
        "One student annotated the topics first.",
        "Then two students annotated the sentiments on the topics.",
        "If a student found that a topic annotation is wrong, he will let us know.",
        "Some mistakes and missing topics were found but there were mainly due to oversights rather than disagreements.",
        "The agreement on sentiment annotations were computed using the Kappa score.",
        "We achieved the Kappa score of 0.63, which indicates strong agreements.",
        "The conflicting cases were then solved through discussion to reach consensus.",
        "We did not find anything that the annotators absolutely disagree with each other.",
        "We now present the results for different combinations of features and classification strategies.",
        "For model building, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM), and the LIBSVM implementation (Chang and Lin, 2001) with a Gaussian kernel, which produces the best results.",
        "All the results are obtained via 10-fold cross validation.",
        "Two-class classification: We first discuss the results for a simpler version of the problem that involves only sentences with positive or negative orientations on some topics (at least one of the clauses must have a positive/negative opinion on a topic).",
        "Neutral sentences are not used (~28% of the total).",
        "The results of all three classifiers are given in Table 5.",
        "The feature sets have been described in Section 4.1.",
        "For all the experiments below, features (1) and (2) are only used by the whole-sentence-based classifier, but not used by the other two classifiers for obvious reasons.",
        "{I+II}: This setting uses sentiment words and phrases, their positions and POS tags as features (we used Brill's POS tagger).",
        "This can be seen as the baseline.",
        "We observe that both the consequent-based and whole-sentence-based classifiers perform dramatically better than the clause-based classifier.",
        "The consequent-based classifier and the whole-sentence-based classifier perform similarly (with the latter being slightly better).",
        "The precision, recall, and F-score are computed as the average of the two classes.",

        "{I+II+III+IV}: This setting includes all the canonical tense based features.",
        "We see marked improvements for the consequent-based and whole-sentence-based classifiers both in term of accuracy and F-score, which are statistically significant compared to those of {I+II+III} at the 95% confidence level based on paired t-test.",
        "All: When all the features are used, the results of all the classifiers improve further.",
        "Two main observations worth mentioning:",
        "1.",
        "Both the consequent-based and whole-sentence-based classifiers outperform the clause-based classifier dramatically.",
        "This confirms our observation that the consequent usually plays the key role in determining the sentiment of the sentence.",
        "This is further reinforced by the fact that the consequent-based classifier actually performs similarly to the whole-sentence-based classifier.",
        "The condition clause seems to give no help.",
        "2.",
        "The second observation is that the linguistic knowledge of canonical tense patterns helps significantly.",
        "This shows that the linguistic knowledge is very useful.",
        "We also noticed that many misclassifications are caused by grammatical errors, use of slang phrases and improper punctuations, which are typical of postings on the Web.",
        "Due to language irregularities (e.g., wrong grammar, missing punctuations, sarcasm, exclamations), the POS tagger makes many mistakes as well causing some errors in the tense based features.",
        "Three-class classification: We now move to the more difficult and realistic case of three classes: positive, negative and neutral (no-opinion).",
        "Table 6 shows the results.",
        "The trend is similar except that the whole-sentence-based classifier now performs markedly better than the consequent-based classifier.",
        "We believe that this is because the neutral class needs information from both the condition and consequent clauses.",
        "This is evident from the fact that there is little or no improvement after {I+II} for the consequent-based classifier.",
        "We also observe that the accuracies and F-scores for the three-class classification are lower than those for the two-class classification.",
        "This is understandable due to the difficulty of determining whether a sentence has opinion or not.",

        "Table 7 shows how the accuracy changes as we increase the window size.",
        "We found that a window size of 6-10 yielded good accuracies.",
        "This is because lower values of n lead to loss of information regarding sentiment words as some sentiment words could be far from the topic.",
        "We finally used 8, which gave the best results.",
        "We also investigated ways of using the negation word in the sentence to correctly predict the sentiment.",
