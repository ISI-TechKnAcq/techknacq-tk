        "To provide users better experiences of search engines, inspecting users' activities and inferring users' interests are indispensible.",
        "Query logs recorded by search engines serves well for these purposes.",
        "Query log conveys the user interest information in the form of slices of the query stream.",
        "Thus the task of session detection consists in distinguishing slice that corresponds to a user interest from other ones, and thus this paper, we adopt the definition of a session following (Jansen et al., 2007):",
        "(A session is) a series of interactions by the user toward addressing a single information need.",
        "This definition is equivalent to that of the \"search goal\" proposed by Jones and Klinkner (2008), which corresponds to an atomic information need, resulting in one or more queries.",
        "This paper adopts a classification point of view to the task of session detection (Jones and Klinkner, 2008).",
        "Given a pair of successive queries in a query log, we examine it in various viewpoints (i.e. features) such as time proximity and similarity of the content of the two queries to determine whether these two queries cross a border of a search session.",
        "In other words, we classify the gap between the two queries into two classes: session shift and session continuation.",
        "In practice, search goals in a search mission and different search missions could be intermingled, and increase the difficulty of correctly identifying them.",
        "In this paper, we do not take this issue into account and simply treat all boundaries between intermingled search goals as session shifts.",
        "The chief advantage in this choice is that we will have the opportunity to make classification model working online without caching user's queries that are pending to be assigned to a session.",
        "Various studies built accurate models in predicting session boundaries and in distinguishing intermingled sessions, and they are summarized in Section 2.",
        "However, none of these works analyzed the contribution of individual features from a user-oriented viewpoint, or evaluated a feature's discrimination power in a general scenario independent of its usage, as this paper does by conducting ROC analyses.",
        "During these analyses, we found that the discrimination power of features varies dramatically, and for different users, the discrimination power of a particular feature also does not remain constant.",
        "Thus, it is appealing to build local models for users with have sufficient size of training examples, and combine the local models' predictions with those made by the global model trained by the whole training data.",
        "However, few of previous works build user-specific models for the sake of characterizing the variability in user's search activities, except that of Murray et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "To fully make use of these two aspects of variability, inspired by Murray et al., we build users' local models based on a much broader range of evidences, and show that different local models vary to a great extent, and experiments show that the local models do make significant improvements to the global model, although the amount is small.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the related work of the session detection task.",
        "In Section 3, we first describe our classification framework as well as the features utilized.",
        "Then we conduct various evaluations on both English and Chinese query logs.",
        "Section 4 introduces the approaches to building local models based on an analysis of the variability of the discrimination power of features, and combine predictions of local models with those of the global model.",
        "Section 5 discusses the experimental results and concludes this paper."

        "The simplest method in session detection is defining a timeout threshold and marking any time gaps of successive queries that exceed the threshold as session shifts.",
        "The thresholds adopted in different studies were significantly different, ranging from 5 minutes to 30 minutes (Silverstein et al., 1999; He and Göker, 2000; Radlinski and Joachims, 2005; Downey et al., 2007).",

        "However, Jones and Klinkner (2008) pointed out that single timeout criterion is always of limited utility, whatever its length is, and incorporating timeout features with other various features achieved satisfactory classification accuracy.",
        "An effective approach to combining the time out features with various evidences for session detection is machine learning.",

        "'s work, and explored other machine learning techniques such as neural networks, multiple linear regression, Monte Carlo simulation, conditional probabilities (Gayo-Avello, 2009), and HMMs (Özmutlu, 2009).",
        "In recent studies, Jones and Klinkner (2008) built logistic regression models to identify search goals and missions, and tackled the intermingled search goal/mission issue by examining arbitrary pairs of queries in the query log.",
        "Another contribution of Jones and Klinkner is that they made a thorough analysis of contributions of individual features.",
        "However, they explored the features' contributions from a feature selection point of view rather than from a user-oriented one, and thus failed to characterize the variability of the discrimination power of the features when applied to different users."

        "We adopt eight features covering both the temporal and the content aspect of pairs of successive queries.",
        "Most these features are commonly used by previous studies (He and Göker, 2000; Özmutlu, 2006; Jones and Klinkner, 2008).",
        "However, in this paper, we will analyze their contributions to the resulted model in a quite different way from that in previous works.",

        "# of char.-n-gram in qi occur in q ,",
        "Note that character-n-grams are accumulative and there could be multiple occurrences of a character-n-gram in a query, so the number of a character-n-gram is the sum of that of all m-grams with m < n, and multiple occurrences are all considered.",
        "At last, the average of character-n-gram distance (ACD) of the pair (qi, qi+1) is:",
        "There are seven features describing the content aspect of a query pair, and they are more or less overlapped (e.g. edit_distance vs. common_char).",
        "However, we show in the next subsection that all these features are beneficial to the final performance.",
        "The query logs we explored include an English search log tracked by AOL from Mar 1, 2006 to May, 31 2006 (Pass et al., 2006), and a Chinese search log tracked by Sogou.com, which is one of the major Chinese Search Engines, from Mar 1, 2007 to Mar 31, 2007.",
        "We applied systematic sampling over the user space on the two logs, which yielded 223 users and 2809 users, corresponding to 6407 and 6917 query instances respectively.",
        "Sampling over the user space instead of over the query space avoids the bias to the most active users who submit much more queries than average users.",
        "For each sampled dataset, we invited annotators who are familiar with IR and search process to determine each pair of successive queries of interest is across the border of a session.",

        "The results show that SVM method clearly outperforms the baseline methods, and timeout method performs poorly.",
        "It may be argued that the poor performance of timeout method is due to the improper threshold value chosen.",
