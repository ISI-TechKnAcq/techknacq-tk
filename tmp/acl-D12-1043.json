        "Whether in a first language (L1) or a second and foreign language (L2), learning to read has been and remains one of the major concerns of education.",

        "reading skills, he/she uses reading exercises, whether there are guided or independent.",
        "For this practice to be efficient, it is necessary that the texts suit the level of students (O?Connor et al2002).",
        "This condition is sometimes difficult to meet for teachers wishing to get off the beaten tracks by not using texts from levelled textbooks or readers.",
        "In this context, readability formulas have long been used to help teachers faster select texts for their students.",
        "These formulas are reproducible methods that aim at matching readers and texts relative to their reading difficulty level.",
        "The Flesch (1948) and Dale and Chall (1948) formulas are probably the best-known examples of those.",
        "They are typical of classic formulas, the first major methodological paradigm developed in the field during the 40's and 50?s.",
        "They were kept as parsimonious as possible, using linear regression to combined two, or sometimes, three surface features, such as word mean length, sentence mean length, or proportion of out-of-simple-vocabulary words.",
        "Later, some scholars (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979; Redish and Selzer, 1985) argued that the classic formulas suffer from several shortcomings.",
        "These formulas only take into account superficial features, ignoring other important aspects contributing to text difficulty, such as coherence, content density, inference load, etc.",
        "They also omit the interactive aspect of the reading process.",
        "In the 80?s, a second paradigm, inspired by structuro-cognitivist theories, intended to overcome these issues.",
        "It focused on higher textual dimensions, such as inference load (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979; Kemper, 1983), density of concepts (Kintsch and Vipond, 1979), or macrostructure (Meyer, 1982).",
        "However, these attempts did not achieve better results than the classic approach, even though they used more principled and more complex features.",
        "Recently, a third paradigm, referred to as the ?AI readability?",
        "by Franc?ois (2011a), has emerged in the field.",
        "Studies that are part of this current share three key features: the use of a large number of texts assessed by experts (coming from textbooks, simplified newspapers or web resources) as training data ; the use of NPL-enable features able to capture a wider range of readability factors, and the combination of those features through a machine learning",
        "algorithm.",
        "Since the work of Si and Callan (2001), this paradigm have spawn several studies for English (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Heilman et al., 2008; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Feng et al., 2010).",
        "However, for French, the field is far from being so thriving.",

        "Readability of French never enjoyed a large success: while readability studies on English dates back to the 20?s, it is only in 1957 that the French-speaking world discovered it through the work of Conquet (1957).",
        "Since then, only a few studies focused on the topic.",
        "The two first French L1 formulas were adaptations of the Flesch formula (Kandel and Moles, 1958; de Landsheere, 1963).",
        "It is only with Henry (1975) that French got a model fitting the particularities of the language.",
        "Henry used cloze tests to assess the level of 60 texts from primary and secondary school textbooks and trained three formulas on this corpus.",
        "It is worth mentioning that Henry's formulas have been applied to FFL by Cor-naire (1988).",
        "During the same time, Richaudeau explored a different path, as a representative of the structuro-cognitivist paradigm.",
        "He used the number of words recalled by a subject after he/she has just read a sentence as a device to measure understanding and provided an ?efficiency formula?",
        "of texts (Richaudeau, 1979).",
        "Although more modern in its conception, Richaudeau's hard-to-implement formula did not achieve the same recognition in the French speaking world as Henry?s.",
        "After those two major efforts, few works followed.",
        "It is worth mentioning two more authors: Mesnager (1989), who designed a classic formula for children that draw inspiration from the Dale and Chall (1948) formula and Daoust et al1996), who developed SATO-CALIBRAGE, a program assessing text difficulty from the first to the eleventh grade.",
        "It can be considered as the first ?AI formula?",
        "for French L1, since it made use of NLP-enabled features.",
        "It is also the last formula published for French L1, if we except the adaptation of the model by Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) to French.",
        "As regards to French L2, the literature is even sparser.",
        "Tharp (1939) published a first formula taking into account one particularity of the L2 context: the cognates.",
        "Those are words sharing a similar form and meaning across two languages and having a facilitating effect in reading.",
        "This idea was recently replicated by Uitdenbogerd (2005), who combined a syntactic feature, the mean number of words per sentence, with the number of cognates per 100 words in her formula.",
        "Although taking into account this effect of the L1 on L2 reading is very interesting, these two studies are confined to a limited audience: English speakers learning French.",
        "As regards a more generic approach, Franc?ois (2009) recently published an ?AI formula?",
        "for FFL, based on logistic regression and ten features.",
        "Among those, he stressed the use of verbal tense information as a way to improve performance.",
        "However, the set of features he experimented remains limited (about 20).",
        "From all this, it seems clear that FFL readability needs to be addressed more thoroughly, especially if we are willing to get a generic model, able to make predictions for L2 readers with any L1 background.",

        "Then, each text have to be assessed with a method able to measure the reading comprehension level of the target population.",
        "Regarding the scale, an obvious choice for the foreign language context was the beginner/intermediate/advanced continuum, recently redefined in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001) as the six following levels: A1 (Breakthrough); A2 (Waystage); B1 (Threshold); B2 (Vantage); C1 (Effective Operational Proficiency) and C2 (Mastery).",
        "This scale has now become the reference for foreign language education, at least in Europe.",
        "Assessing the reading difficulty of texts with respect to a target population of readers was a more challenging issue.",
        "Several techniques have been used in the literature, the most important of which are comprehension tests, cloze tests and expert judgements.",
        "They all postulate a given population of readers, although relying on expert judgements save the need for a sample of subjects to take a test.",
        "In this case, texts comes from textbooks whose content difficulty have been assessed by the publishers.",

        "Studies such as van Oosten et al2011) found that expert agreement on a same corpus of texts might be insufficient for a classification task.",

        "The complete set was classified in four families, depending on the kind of information each one is supposed to represent.",
        "These families were: ?lexical?, ?syntactic?, ?semantic?, and ?specific to FFL context?.",
        "Each of them was further divided in subfamilies, described in the rest of the section 1.",
        "Lexical features have been shown to be the most important level of information in many readability studies (Chall and Dale, 1995; Lorge, 1944).",
        "It is then not surprising that a wide range of lexical predictors have been developed in the literature.",
        "Our own set comprised the following subfamilies: Statistics of lexical frequencies: frequencies of words in a text are a good indicator of the text's overall difficulty (Stenner, 1996).",
        "They are usually summarized via the mean, but we also tested the median, the interquartile range, as well as the 75th and 90th percentiles.",

        "It is a lexicon including about 50,000 lemmas and 125,000 inflected forms whose frequencies were obtained from movie subtitles.",
        "Since French has a rich morphology, we considered the probabilities of both lemma and inflected forms.",
        "Moreover, following an idea from Elley (1969), we also computed the above mentioned statistics for given POS words, such as content word, nouns, verbs, etc.",

        "Word length: mean word length is another classic feature in readability (Flesch, 1948; Smith, 1961).",

        "N-grams models: Si and Callan (2001) shown that n-grams models can successfully be applied to readability.",
        "We then used both a simple unigram approach based on the frequencies from Lexique3, and a more complex bigram model trained on two different corpora: the Google n-grams (Michel et al. 2011) and a corpus of newspaper articles from Le Soir amounting to 5, 000, 000 words 2.",
        "Both were normalized according the length n of the text as follows:",
        "where wi is the ith word and h a limited history of length 0 (unigram) or 1 (bigram).",
        "2Smoothing algorithms used were respectively the simple Good-Turing algorithm (Gale and Sampson, 1995) for unigrams and linear interpolation (Chen and Goodman, 1999) for the bi-grams.",
        "Lexical diversity: the repetition effect is another factor known to affect the reading process (Bowers, 2000).",
        "It has been mainly implemented through the classic type-token ratio (TTR) that suffers from being dependent on the text length.",
        "This is why we defined a normalized TTR, which is the mean score of several TTRs, computed on text's fragments of equal length.",
        "This way, long texts were made comparable with short ones.",
        "Orthographic neighborhood: we finally suggested a new lexical variable, based on the fact that some characteristics of the orthographic neighbors 3 of a word are known to impact the reading of this word (Andrews, 1997).",
        "Thirteen predictors were implemented to account for the number or the frequency of the orthographic neighbors of all words in a text.",
        "The syntactic level of information is another traditional area of investigation in readability.",
        "Although most of the scholars in the field agree that it does not lead to such efficient predictors as the lexical level, they have noticed it can be combined with the latter to improve performance of readability formulas.",
        "We therefore investigated the following subfamilies: Sentence length: the traditional approach to syntactic difficulty relied on the number of words per sentence.",
        "We have approached it through various statistics such as the mean, the median, or several percentiles.",
        "Part of speech ratios: Bormuth (1966) demonstrated the good predictive power of some POS ratios in a text.",
        "We computed 156 ratios based on TreeTagger's POS (Schmid, 1994).",
        "They operated as proxies for the syntactic complexity of sentences, since we did not use features based on a parser 4.",
        "Verbs: although the tense and moods found in a text have been hardly considered in the field, Car-reiras et al1997) suggested that verbal aspects are important while building a mental representation of a text and therefore impact its understanding.",
        "They help the reader to distinguish between major and minor elements associated with events described by these verbs.",
        "We therefore replicated and enhanced the feature set proposed by Franc?ois (2009), considering either binary indicators or proportions of the use of tenses or moods in a text.",
        "The importance of semantic and cognitive factors have been particularly stressed by the structuro-cognitivist paradigm, although Miller and Kintsch (1980), as well as Kemper (1983), eventually admitted not being able to demonstrate the superiority of those new predictors over traditional ones.",
        "More recent work also reported limited evidence of this alleged superiority (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008; Feng et al2010).",
        "In order to clarify as much as possible the situation for FFL, we implemented the following features: Personnalization level: Dale and Tyler (1934) suggested that informal texts should be easier to read and that informality might be assessed through the type of personal pronouns found in a text.",
        "On this assumption, 13 variables were defined to take into account various personal pronouns proportions in the text.",
        "Conceptual density: Kintsch et al1975) showed that the number of propositions as well as the number of different arguments in a sentence influence its reading time.",
        "Following Kintsch's propositional model, we used Denside?es (Lee et al2010) to capture conceptual complexity.",
        "It is a program able to estimate the mean number of propositions per word in a text using 35 rules relying on lexical and POS clues.",
        "in its corpus, noticed that features based on parse trees were less efficient than classic ones, such as sentence length or part of speech ratios.",
        "Therefore, it seemed unlikely that the information collected by means of syntactic parsers, which are still committing a significant number of errors, at least for French, would belie these findings.",
        "Lexical cohesion : the level of cohesion in a text was measured as the average cosine of all pair of adjacent sentences in the text.",

        "defined by Graesser et al.",

        "For LSA, we applied a singular value decomposition (SVD), and after comparing various sizes with a cross-validation procedure, we retained a small 15-dimensional space.",
        "Apart from the effect of cognates (Uitdenbogerd, 2005; Tharp, 1939), few features specific to the L2 context were previously investigated.",
        "It is probably because such an approach requires to train a model for each pair of language of interest and gather suitable data for evaluation.",
        "Since our study intended to design a generic model, we focused on specific predictors affecting L2 reading, whatever the learner's mother tongue is: Multi-word expressions (MWE): MWEs are acknowledged to cause problems to L2 learners for production (Bahns and Eldaw, 1993).",
        "However, the effect of MWE on the reception side remains unclear, especially for beginners.",
        "Ozasa et al2007) tested the mean of the absolute frequency of all MWEs in a text as an indication of its difficulty, but it appeared non significant.",
        "In a latter experiment involving a larger set of MWE-based predictors, Franc?ois and Watrin (2011) detected a significant, but limited effect.",
        "We therefore replicated this set, which includes variables based on the frequencies of MWE, their syntactic structure, their number or their length.",

        "It should be noted that each of these measures was estimated through a tenfold cross-validation procedure, which allowed us to compare performances of different models with a T-test.",
        "The comparison between the models was performed in two steps.",
        "First, we computed T-tests based on adjacc to compare the models based on a same set of features (either Exp1, Exp2, or Auto).",
        "This allowed us to pick up the best classifier for each set.",
        "In a second step, these three best models were compared the same way, which resulted in the selection of the very best classifier.",
        "The decision of adopting the adjacent accuracy as a criterion instead of the accuracy was motivated by our conviction that our system should rather avoid serious errors (i.e. larger than one level) than be more accurate, while sometimes generating terrible mistakes.",
        "However, it appeared that both metrics were mostly consistent.",
        "The performance of the different models are displayed in Table 4.",
        "It is first interesting to note that the baseline (based on SVM) already gives interesting results.",
        "It reaches a classification accuracy of 34%, which is about twice the random.",
        "As regards the first model (Exp1), based on RLM and including four predictors, it outperforms the baseline by 5%, a difference close to significance (t(9) = 1.77; p = 0.055).",
        "Therefore, combining variables from several families seems to improve performance over the ?classic?",
        "baseline, limited to lexico-syntactic features.",
        "This finding is reinforced by the SVM model from Exp2, which includes eight features.",
        "It performs significantly better than the baseline (t(9) = 7Heilman et al2008) defined it as ?the proportion of predictions that were within one level of the human assigned label for the given text?.",
        "values for a random classification, and the ?classic?",
        "baseline.",
        "2.36; p = 0.02), with an accuracy gain of 7%.",
        "However, to that point, it was not clear whether this superiority was indeed a consequence of maximizing the kind of information brought to the model or merely the result of the increased number of predictor.",
        "We thus performed another experiment to address this issue.",
        "The model Exp1 was compared with Auto-OLR, the best ordinal logistic model obtained through the stepwise selection (see Tables 4 and 3), and previously discarded as a result of the T-test comparisons.",
        "Like Exp1, it also contains four predictors, but they are all lexical or syntactic features.",
        "Therefore, this model does not maximize the type of information.",
        "Surprisingly, we observed that Auto-OLR obtained similar and even slightly better performance than Exp1 (+2% for both acc and adjacc).",
        "Thus, the claim that maximizing the source of information should yield better models did not stand on our data.",
        "Finally, our best performing model was based on the Auto feature set and SVM.",
        "Its accuracy was increased by 8% in comparison with the Exp2 model, which is clearly a significant improvement (t(9) = 2.61; p = 0.01), and outperformed the baseline by 15%.",
        "As mentioned previously, this model includes 46 features coming from our four families.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the quality of the predictions is not the same across the levels, as shown in Table 5.",
        "They are more accurate for classes situated at both ends of the difficulty scale, namely A1, C1 and C2.",
        "For A1, this is explained because texts for beginners are more typical, having very short sentences and simple words.",
        "However, the case of C1 and C2 classes is more surprising and might be due to some specificities of the learning algorithm.",
        "A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 Adj.",
        "acc.",
        "100% 71% 67% 71% 86% 83% Table 5: Adjacent accuracy per level, computed on one of the 10 folds.",
        "Its adjacent accuracy was 79%, which is very similar to the average value of the model.",
        "We also assessed the specific contribution of each family of features in two ways: on one hand, we trained a model including only the features from this family; on the other hand, we trained a model including all features except those from this family.",
        "Results for the four families are displayed at Table 6.",
        "It appeared that the lexical family was the most accurate set of predictors (40.5%) and yielded the highest loss in performance when set aside, especially for adjacent accuracy.",
        "In fact, this was the only set whose absence significantly impacted adjacent accuracy, suggesting that the other type of predictors can only improve the accuracy of predictions, but are not able to reduce the amount of critical mistakes.",
        "The second best family was, expectedly, the syntactic one.",
        "Its accuracy closely match that of the lexical set, although more severe mistakes were made, as shown by the drop in adjacent accu",
        "racy.",
        "Finally, our two other families was clearly inferior, but they still improved slightly the accuracy of our model, although not the adjacent accuracy.",
        "Family only All except family Acc.",
        "Adj.",
        "acc.",
        "Acc.",
        "Adj.",
        "acc.",
        "for models either using only one family of predictors, or including all 46 features except those of one family.",
        "Comparisons with other FFL models are difficult to provide: not only there are few formulas available for FFL, but some of these focus on a different audience, making comparability low.",
        "This is why we were able to compare our results with only two previous models.",
        "The first of them is a classic readability formula by Kandel and Moles (1958), which is an adaptation of the Flesch (1948) formula for French: Y = 207?",
        "1.015lp?",
        "0.736lm (2) where Y is a readability score ranging from 100 (easiest) to 0 (harder); lp is the average number of words per sentence and lm is the average number of syllables per 100 words.",
        "Although it was not designed for FFL, we considered it, since it is one of the most well-known formula for French and the two features combined are very general.",
        "Their predictive power should not vary much in both contexts, as shown by Greenfield (2004) for English.",
        "We evaluated it on the same test corpus as our SVM model and obtained really lower values : a R of 0.55 and an accuracy of 33%.",
        "The second model was that of Franc?ois (2009), which is based on a multinomial logistic regression including ten features: a unigram model similar to ML3, the number of letters per word, the number of words per sentence, and binary variables indicating the presence of a past participle, present participle, imperfect, infinitive, conditional, future and present subjunctive tenses in the text.",
        "To our knowledge, this model is the best current generic model available for FFL.",
        "On our data, it yielded an accuracy of 41% and an adjacent accuracy of 72.7%, both estimated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure.",
        "Therefore, our new approach achieved an accuracy gain of 8% over this state-of-the-art model, which was considered as a significant difference (t(9) = 3.72; p = 0.002).",
        "Apart of those two studies, Uitdenbogerd (2005) also developed recently a FFL formula.",
        "However, as explained previously, this work focused on a specific category of L2 readers, the English-speakers learning FFL, which resulted in a different problem.",
        "She reported a higher R than us (0.87 against 0.73).",
        "However, this value might be the training one and was estimated on a small amount of novel beginnings.",
        "It is therefore likely that our model generalize better, especially across genres and L2 readers with different L1 backgrounds."

        "In this paper, we introduced a new ?AI readability?",
        "formula for FFL, able to predict the level of texts according to the largely-spread CEFR scale.",
        "Our model is based on a SVM classifier and combines 46 features corresponding to several levels of linguistic information.",
        "Among those, we suggested some new features: the normalized TTR and the set of variables based on several characteristics of words?",
        "neighbors.",
        "Comparing our approach with two previously published formulas, our model significantly outperformed both these works.",
        "Therefore, it represent a robust generic solution for FFL readers willing to find various kind of texts that suit their linguistic abilities.",
        "Besides the creation of a new FFL readability formula, this study produced two valuable insights.",
        "First, we showed that maximizing the type of linguistic information might not be the best path to go, since a model based on four lexico-syntactic features yielded predictions as accurate as those of a model relying on our Exp1 set of variables.",
        "However, this finding might be partly accounted by the lower predictive power of the features from the semantic and specific-to-FFL family, with the notable exception of the LSA-based predictor (avLocalLsa-Lem), which is the third best predictor when considered alone.",
        "This leads us to our second finding, relative to the",
        "set of semantic features.",
        "Yet their importance was largely praised in the structuro-cognitivist paradigm and in most of the recent works, our experiments cast serious doubts about their efficiency, at least in a L2 context.",
        "Not only the expert models, to which we imposed the presence of one or two semantic predictors, did not perform the best, but none of the features from our semantic set was retained during the automatic selection of the variables for the logistic models.",
        "On the contrary, in some subsets, the LSA-based feature was sometimes considered as collinear with the other variables.",
        "Finally and foremost, we showed that dropping the semantic features did not impact significantly the performance of our best model.",
        "With reservations one may have because of the limited number of semantic predictors in our set, these results however raise some concerns about whether the information coming from semantic variables is really different from that carried by lexico-syntactic features.",
        "Our results clearly show that this may not be the case.",
        "This conclusion contradicts the assumptions of the structuro-cognitivist paradigm, but corroborates Chall and Dale (1995)'s view that the information carried by semantic predictors is largely correlated with that of lexico-syntactical ones.",
        "Further investigation on this issue would definitely be worthwhile, since several facts could explain these contradictory findings.",
        "First, it might be that semantic and lexical predictors are correlated because the methods used for the parameterization of the semantic factors heavily relie on lexical information.",
        "This is the case for the LSA, as well as for the propositional approach of the content density.",
        "Alternatively, this difference with other work in L1 could be due to the L2 context.",
        "Chall and Dale (1995) explained that the lexicon and the syntax are more important for children learning to read than for more advanced readers, who then become more sensitive to organisationnal aspects.",
        "From the threshold hypothesis (Alderson, 1984), we know that before reaching a sufficient level of proficiency, L2 learners struggle mostly with the lexicon and the syntactic structures.",
        "This might explain why lexico-syntactic predictors were so predominant in our experiments.",
        "Some further experiments are thus needed to investigate which of these facts better account for our findings on the semantic features.",
        "A last avenue of research worth mentioning would be to develop the family of specific-to-FFL predictors, to determine whether taking into account the impact of a given L1 language on the readability of L2 texts would increase performance over a generic model enough so that tuning efforts are worthwhile."
