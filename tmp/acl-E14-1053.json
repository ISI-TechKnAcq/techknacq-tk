        "For search, the presence of links in a document collection adds valuable information over that contained in the text of the documents alone.",
        "Each act of linking can be interpreted as a latent judgement of authority or trust which is bestowed onto the linked documents (Kleinberg, 1998).",
        "This makes authority an objective measure of how important that paper is to a community who confer that authority.",
        "The citation count is the simplest of these, which has been used successfully for decades for biblio-metrics (Garfield, 1972) and for mapping out scientific fields via bibliometric coupling (Kessler, 1963) and co-citations (Small, 1978).",
        "More recently, citation counts have been shown to improve effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval (Meij and De Rijke, 2007; Fujii, 2007).",
        "In science, the peer review process ensures that the right to cite is hard-earned, but on the web, hy-perlinking is infinitely cheap.",
        "This means that that the authority of webpages cannot simply be approximated as the number of incoming links.",
        "Algorithmically more complex authority such as the random-surfer model PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) or the authorities/hub based algorithm HITS (Kleinberg, 1998)) have spectacularly improved search results in comparison to standard IR models relying on similarity calculations based on the words in the text and other text-internal informatioh.",
        "Much recent work in bibliographic search has been driven by the intuition that what works for the web should also work for science, even though citations are more comparable to each other in weight than hyperlinks.",
        "Case studies comparing PageRank-based authority measures against citation counts alone report some cases where PageRank is superior (Chen et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2008), but experimental proof of standard PageRank outperforming citation counts in a large-scale bibliographic search experiment is still outstanding.",
        "In at least one such experiment, PageRank performed worse than citation count (Bethard and Jurafsky, 2010).",
        "Straightforward PageRank calculations, when applied to the scientific literature, are hampered by two factors: on the one hand, the progression of time imposes a directional structure on the citation network.",
        "Therefore, PageRank values of older papers are systematically inflated as PageRank can only ever flow from newer to older papers (Walker et al., 2007).",
        "501 Secondly, and more interestingly, researchers earn their expertise in particular, well-defined scientific fields.",
        "We propose that this requires a more fine-grained notion of specific ?",
        "not global ?",
        "expertise.",
        "Our solution is to use LDA-derived topics (Blei et al., 2003) as approximations for scientific fields, and to model the importance of a paper as a mixture of its relative expertise in each of the topics it covers.",
        "The second aspect of our solution, somewhat more mundane but still necessary to adapt PageRank successfully to model scientific expertise, is to age-taper the resultant estimation.",
        "In this paper, we present ThemedPageRank (TPR), our model of topic-specific scientific exper-tise, which incorporates the two modifications, and provide evidence that both are necessary for the adequate application of PageRank-style authority calculations to the scientific literature.",
        "In two evalua-tions, our model beats standard PageRank and citation counts by a large margin.",
        "Previous models exist which combine the idea of personalising PageRank by topics, but our manipulation of both PageRank's bias and transition probabilities differs from these.",
        "Our experiments also support the claim of our sys-tem's superiority over these models.",
        "We use two tasks to evaluate the system's performance.",
        "The first is the reintroduction of an ar-ticle's reference items that have been artificially removed.",
        "The assumption here is that a good model of document?document similarity should be able to guess which articles any given paper would have cited.",
        "The second task is the automatic creation of reading lists, of the kind that an expert might prepare for their students.",
        "We asked experts to create a gold standard of such reading lists, and compare our system against the current de facto state-of-the-art in such tasks, Google Scholar, and again find that our system beats it comfortably.",
        "This article is structured as follows: the next section describes our model, which section 3 contrasts to related work.",
        "The evaluations are described in sections 4 and 5.",
        "Section 6 concludes.",
        "2 Authority Model Our model first determines an LDA space (Blei et al., 2003) representing the entire document collec-tion, which results in a set of topics describing the entirety of the field.",
        "It then calculates an author-Figure 1: A High-level view of LDA.",
        "ity model for each topic based on a modification of Personalised PageRank (Page et al., 1998).",
        "Depending on the search need, the input (one or more keyword(s) or paper(s)) is converted into a topic dis-tribution, which we then use to linearly combine the multiple topic-specific expertise scores of our model into a unique authority score representing the fit between search need and document.",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is a Bayesian generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data, which has become popular for the modelling of scientific text corpora (Wei and Croft, 2006; He et al., 2009; Blei and Lafferty, 2006).",
        "In LDA, a document in the corpus is modelled and explicitly represented as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics, while each topic is modelled as an infinite mixture over the underlying set of words in the corpus.",
        "We use LDA predominantly to produce the latent topics that form a foundation for the relationships between papers and technical terms in a corpus.",
        "Technical terms act as the terms in our model (rather than words), because technical terms are important artefacts for formulating knowledge from scientific texts (Ananiadou, 1994; Justeson and Katz, 1995), because descriptions of topics are better understandable using technical terms rather than words (Wallach, 2006; Wang et al., 2007); and to make our model more scalable to large corpora.",
        "The method we use to find technical terms is light-weight and requires little infrastructure, but does not represent state-of-the-art in terminology detection (Lopez and Romary, 2010; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "We collect all n-grams of words which appear in 2 or more titles of all documents in the corpus, filter out all unigrams appearing in the Scrabble TWL98 word list, then all n-grams starting or ending in stop words.",
        "To de-502 cide whether a subsumed term should be removed if the subsuming term exists (?statistical machine translation?",
        "subsumes both ?statistical machine?",
        "and ?machine translation?",
        "), we remove those n-grams whose frequency is lower than 25% of their subsuming terms.",
        "Finally, only the most frequent 25% of the remaining unigrams and bigrams are retained.",
        "We then build a D ?",
        "V matrix ?, which contains the counts of V technical-terms (the columns) in each of the D documents (the rows) in Fig. 1.",

        "To model topic-specific expertise in science, we modify the original PageRank calculation of Page at al. (1998) by adding a topic dimension to the score of both the bias and transition probabilities: TPR(t, d, k + 1) = ?B(t, d) +(1?",

        "This solution avoids the computational scalability problem with Richardson and Domingos?",

        "Several researchers followed Brin and Page and Haveliwala in altering only the bias 503 probabilities, including Wu et al. (2006) and Gori and Pucci (2006).",
        "In contrast, Narayan et al. (2003) and Pal and Narayan (2005) propose a model of personalisation that alters the transition probabilities instead of the bias probabilities.",
        "Under their model, the transition probability T (t, d) is proportional to the number of words in document d that are strongly present in the documents contained in topic t. Nie et al. (2006) produce a more computationally scalable version of the ideas presented in Pal and Narayan (2005) by associating a context vector with each document, with a fixed set of topics (12 in their case), for which they learn these context vectors using a naive Bayes classifier.",

        "al's model, one is picked with equal probability.",
        "In contrast, our model implements the obvious intuition that if one follows cita-tions, one should also favour those that are closely associated with the topic.",

        "Evaluation of a search model by RLR is cheap because of the readily available gold standard, and it thus allows for experiments with large data sets.",
        "State-of-the-art solutions to RLR combine lexical similarity (often via topic models), measures of authority over a citation graph, and information about social constructs and historic patterns of citation behaviour.",
        "Strohman et al. (2007) perform RLR with the paper text as a query to their recommendation system, using text similarity, citation counts, citation coupling, author information, and the citation graph.",
        "Their model achieves a mean-average precision of 0.102 against a corpus from the Rexa10 database.",
        "Bethard and Jurafsky (2010) improve on Strohman et al. by the use of a SVM with 19 features from 6 broad categories: similar terms; cited by others; recency; cited using similar terms; similar topics; and social habits.",
        "They achieve a MAP of 504 0.279 against the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008), with the following features performing best: publication age, citation counts, the terms in citation sentences, and the LDA topics of the citing documents.",
        "They also use (unchanged) PageRank authority counts as one of the features, but find that it provides little discriminative power to the SVM.",
        "A drawback of their method is the large amount of information that has to be provided to create their SVM features, and the expensive training routine, which is based on pairwise paper?paper comparisons in the corpus.",
        "Variations of the RLR tasks exist, which additionally determine the position in the text of a paper where each recommended citation should occur (Tang and Zhang, 2009; He et al., 2011; Lu, 2011), a task which is typically solved by comparing a moving window in the query paper against millions of previously located citation contexts with.",
        "The drawback of this technique in contrast to ours is the fact that new papers, which have not collected sufficient contexts in the literature, are severely disadvantaged and will never be recommended.",
        "We first create topics and then apply PageRank to find expertise within topical networks.",
        "It is however also possible to simultaneously model citations and terms (Cohn and Hofmann, 2001; Mann et al., 2006).",
        "Such models are not normally directly comparable to ours; for instance Bharat and Henzinger's (1998) model, a modified version of HITS (Klein- berg, 1998), is query-specific.",
        "There are numerous extensions to LDA that incorporate external information in addition to the lexical information inside the documents in a corpus, via author-topic models and models of publication venues (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2008).",
        "Erosheva et al. (2004) model a corpus using a multinomial distribution simultaneously over the citations and terms in each document.",
        "Topics (which they call aspects) are associated with a list of the most likely words (inter- pretable as topics) and citations (interpretable as au-thorities) in that aspect.",
        "Extensions of the model exist (Nallapati and Cohen, 2008; Gruber et al., 2007; Chang and Blei, 2010; Kataria et al., 2010; Dietz et al., 2007).",
        "We avoid the tight coupling of topic discovery and citation modeling that the above-mentioned works follow for several reasons.",
        "Firstly, such models only work for papers and citations that were present during the learning stage, and there is no mechanism for predicting influential citations for topics in gen-eral, or for combinations of topics.",
        "The tight coupling might also result in overlooking some author-ities, namely those that are authoritative across several topics, which will be penalised via low joint distribution probabilities in combined methods because of the division of the probabilities across several topics.",
        "Secondly, and more disturbingly, such models will not locate topics that lack an authority because the authority component of the joint distribution will be near-zero.",
        "This rules out niches in a corpus where papers are equally relevant to each other, or where the niches are so young that they do not yet have an established citation network.",
        "There is also a scalability issue with joint models of topics and citations.",
        "The evaluation data used in coupled models is generally small, with the number of papers ranging under around 2,000, the number of citations ranging under 10,000, and the number of topics in their models ranging from eight to twenty.",
        "But LDA has been shown to scale to corpora of millions of terms (Newman et al., 2006), and PageRank to billions (Page et al., 1998) of documents.",
        "Our model, which advocates a pipelined approach, benefits from the fact that separate topic modelling is computationally tractable using LDA, and the fact that citation graph modelling is cheap using Personalised PageRank.",

        "We removed from it corrupted documents, i.e., those of less than 100 characters or containing only control characters.",

        "We do not use this meta-data because we wanted to build as system that can be applied to any large collection of arti-cles, where external meta-data would not normally exist.",

        "The top part of Fig. 2 shows that our model (MAP=0.302) outperforms their best model (MAP=0.287; difference at 5% confidence with Wilcoxon Ranked Squares test), despite our model being a general, light-weight IR system, which relies on LDA and PageRank alone, and theirs is a specialised state-of-the art system, which relies on heavy-weight machine learning and on additional sociological features.",
        "The lower part of Fig. 2 compares the influence of citation count, global PageRank, topic similar-ity, and combinations of topic similarity with citation counts or global PageRank, and our model (TPR).",
        "For these tests, we use the entire corpus of 10,000 papers with more than 5 citations.",
        "Over the baseline (A), n-gram-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (NFIDF), both citation counts (B) and global PageRank (C) make a small improvement.",
        "Global LDA similarity scores (D) fare little better.",
        "As the performance of the full model (G; MAP=0.268) shows, the inclusion of topic models lead to a large improvement over any of the above.",
        "This is, as far as we are aware, the first time that a large-scale evaluation that finds significant improvements of a PageRank implementation over citation counts in scientific search.",
        "We next consider our two modifications, age-adjusting (E) and double-biasing (F), in isolation.",
        "We use two versions of our system where we switched off age-tapering and double-biasing (ie., we only work with a change in the bias probabili-ties, as do Nie etal.",
        "(2006), Havaliwala (2003) (al- though their models do not include automatically generated topics) and Yang et al. (2009)).",
        "Our model comfortably outperforms TPR-NoDB in both the 800 and 10,000 paper experiment.",
        "Similarly, the effect of age-tapering alone can be seen from the performance of TPR-NoAge (our model without age-adjusting), in the difference between 0.267 and 0.302 and that between 0.242 and 0.268 (signif- icant at 99%).",
        "This confirms our claim that a topic-specific age-tapered PageRank is superior to global PageRank in scientific citation networks.",
        "5 Evaluation 2: Reading Lists The aim of the second experiment is to test our model against a much cleaner, albeit smaller gold standard: on the task of reconstructing the material of expert-created reading lists.",
        "We compare our system's performance to three standard, commonly used search engines: Lucene TFIDF, the Google-indexed ACL Anthology, and Google Scholar.",
        "We chose Google-index and Google Scholar because they represent commonly used state-of-the-art commercial search engines, and the Google-index is what is currently offered as the standard ACL Anthology search tool.",
        "In contrast, Lucene TFIDF was chosen to represent an easy-to-interpret, repro-ducible, out-of-the-box baseline implementing the simplest kind of lexical similarity search without any notion of authority.",
        "Of the three search engines, 506 we would predict Google Scholar to be the toughest competitor to TPR, because it uses citation information directly and it is reasonable to expect that the Google Scholar algorithm employs some domain adaptation to the scientific domain.",
        "We created gold standard expert-written reading lists using the following protocol.",
        "Eight experts were recruited from the computational linguistics groups of two universities (3 from one, 5 from the other).",
        "All experts had a PhD in computational linguistics and several years of research experience.",
        "They were asked to choose a subject for an (imag- inary or existing) reading list for an MPhil student, concerning an area in which they know the literature well.",
        "We purposefully did not give them guidance as to the size of the reading list as we wanted to observe how experts create reading lists.",
        "During the interview, the experimenter documented the final list chosen by the expert and made sure all papers chosen were present in the 2010 version of the ACL Anthology Network.",
        "This procedure resulted in reading lists of the following topics and sizes: statistical parsing (22 pa-pers); parser evaluation (4); distributional semantics (14); domain adaptation for parsing (11); information extraction (9); lexical semantics (14); statistical machine translation models (5); and concept-to-text generation (16).",
        "In our retrieval model, which topic distribution is chosen for a query depends on whether the query is an exact match to one of the technical terms found by our model.",
        "If it is, then the topic distribution of the technical term is used directly as the query topic distribution ?q, t (i.e. a transposed renormalized ?",
        "in Fig. 1).",
        "If not, we perform a keyword-based search (using Lucene TFIDF), and use the average topic distribution of the top 20 documents returned as the query topic distribution (i.e. several ?i in Fig. 1).",
        "The query topic distribution is then used to linearly combine the topic-specific TPRs into a unique TPR tailored to the query.",
        "The 20 documents with the highest TPR are recommended.",
        "The three baselines are used as follows in the experiment: The experiment is performed by issuing the topic of the reading list (exactly as given to us by the experts) as a key-word based query to each system and recording the top 20 resulting papers answers.",
        "For Lucene TFIDF, we downloaded Lucene.NET v2.9.2 and indexed our 2010 snapshot of the ACL Anthology using standard Lucene parameters for the TFIDF model.",
        "For the Google-indexed ACL Anthology (AAN), we use the interface provided on the ACL Anthology website.",
        "In order to provide an identical search ground, we automatically exclude from the return lists papers added after the creation of the AAN snapshot.",
        "For Google Scholar (GS), we use the interface provided at scholar.google.com, and parse returns to exclude non-AAN material semi-automatically.",
        "In the case of Google Scholar, we restrict the search ground to the ACL Anthology by filtering the top 200 return sets (which may lead to fewer than 20 papers returned).",
        "We report FCSC, RCSC and F-score for each algorithm.",
        "FCSC and RCSC are new metrics which address the problem that F-score, being binary, does not support the notion of a ?close hit?, combined with the fact that we require a fine-grained comparison of the quality of different systems retrieved lists despite the small size of our gold standard.",
        "Citation Substitution Coefficient (FCSC), a new metric for RLR, gives higher scores to papers closely related to the target papers by citation distance.",
        "The FCSC of each expert paper is the inverse of the number of nodes in the minimal citation graph connecting each expert paper to any system-retrieved paper (thus ranging between 0 and 1; non-connected expert papers receive a zero score).",
        "We also introduce Reverse Citation Substitution Coefficient (RCSC), which measures the inverse of the number of nodes in the minimal citation graph connecting each system-retrieved paper to any expert paper.",
        "RCSC makes sure that systems cannot simply increase their FCSC values by returning many irrelevant papers.",
        "RCSC thus corresponds to preci-sion, while FCSC corresponds to recall.",
        "The system RCSC and FCSC scores we report are the average scores of all the system-retrieved and expert papers, respectively.",
        "Reporting both scores gives a good overall picture of system performance, particularly when read together with the F-score.",
        "Fig. 3 shows that our model comfortably beats the competitor systems according to all metrics.",
        "In par-ticular, our model > GS/AAN > Lucene TFIDF1.",
        "1For FCSC, the differences are statistically significant at 507 FCSC RCSC F-score AAN/Google 0.527 0.317 0.117 GS 0.519 0.364 0.112 Lucene TFIDF 0.412 0.330 0.040 TPR 0.563 0.456 0.128 Figure 3: Reading List Creation: Results.",
        "Concerning simpler methods of estimating author-ity, Fig. 4 shows that a multiplication of TFIDF by citation count (as Fujii (2007) does) results in a FCSC/RCSC of 0.419/0.359 (reported as TF-CC), and age-tapering of citation-count by dividing the citation count by the age of the paper in years (reported as TF-CC-A) results in FCSC/RCSC of 0.491/0.442.",
        "We again compare different versions of PageRank.",
        "Global PageRank can be built into the system by simple multiplication of PR scores as above, with and without age-tapering (reported as TF-PR and TF-PR-A, respectively).",
        "We observe a similar effect to the one reported by Bethard and Jurafsky and seen in experiment 1, namely that global PageRank only performs similar to citation counts (0.450/0.360 vs 0.419/0.359).",
        "With respect to double-biasing and age-tapering we see the same effect as in experiment 22.",
        "In fact, we can see from these results that global PageRank barely improves over standard TFIDF, while age-tapering even without topics already brings quite some improvement.",
        "Overall, these results confirms our claim of the superiority of a topic-specific PageRank over global PageRank in scientific citation networks.",
        "6 Conclusions We present here the first experiments that pinpoint which modifications to PageRank are necessary to 99% confidence via a two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, except that between GS and AAN (for which the confidence interval is only 96%) and that between Lucene and AAN, where it is 98%.",
        "Non-parametric paired tests such as the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test can be used on FCSC, but not on RCSC, as there are different sets of underlying system-retrieved papers in each case.",
        "For RCSC, differences between our model and all others at 99% confidence interval, between GS and AAN/Lucene TFIDF at the 95% interval.",
        "F-score is reported for completeness.",
        "2Wilcoxon Signed Rank test found all differences significant at the 99% level, except that between TF-PR and Lucene TFIDF (significant only at the 90% level), and the following equiva-lences: Lucene TFIDF = TF-CC; TF-PR = TF-CC; TF-CC-A = TF-PR-A; TF-CC-A = TF-PR.",
        "FCSC RCSC TF-CC 0.419 0.359 TF-CC-A 0.491 0.442 TF-PR 0.450 0.360 TF-PR-A 0.512 0.407 TPR-NoDB 0.541 0.440 TPR-NoAge 0.526 0.436 Figure 4: Citation counts and PageRank variants.",
        "adequately cater for the highly specialised situation we encounter in science.",
        "The modification we suggest are to use LDA-derived topics (Blei et al., 2003) as approximations for scientific fields, to calculate authority in a topic-specific way, and to age-taper the authority scores.",
        "We present formulae where topics personalise both the bias and the transition probabilities.",
        "This results in a general IR model for science incorporating a robust notion of authority.",
        "Our implementation requires only minimal resources and relies only on LDA and PageRank cal-culation, which means that it is efficient during train-ing, retraining and at search time.",
        "We perform two evaluations.",
        "In both, our model significantly outperforms not only state-of-the-art, but also standard PageRank, non-age-tapered (but topical) PageRank, and non-topical (but age-tapered) PageRank.",
        "Our model achieves its competitive performance by using only the raw text and citation links.",
        "It requires no external informa-tion, neither explicit sociological information such as past collaborations between authors, nor the expertise and cooperation of like-minded readers, as collaborative models do.",
        "While successful applications of collaborative filtering to bibliometric search are rife (Goldberg et al., 2001; Agarwal et al., 2005; McNee et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2004), including to reading list generation (Ekstrand et al., 2010), we wanted an entirely independent authority-based IR model similarity.",
        "CF also suffers from a cold-start phenomenon, where recommendations are generally poor where data is sparse, and has to wait for papers to be rated by a large number of authors (rather than cited) before it can rank them.",
        "Should the reader wish to evaluate the performance of TPR on their own PDF papers, it has been incorporated into the Qiqqa reference management software 3.",
