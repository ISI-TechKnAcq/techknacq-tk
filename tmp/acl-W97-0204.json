        "The research present here is to be conducted under the FrameNet research product at the University of California.' On this project our primary aim is to produce frame-semantic descriptions of lexical items; our concern with semantically tagged corpora is at both ends of our research.",
        "That is, we expect to use partially semantically tagged corpora in the investigation stage – perhaps nothing more than having WordNet hypemyms associated with nouns – but we will produce semantically tagged corpus lines as a by-product of our work.",
        "Most major grammatical theories now accept the general principle that some set of semantic roles (\"case roles\", \"thematic roles\", or \"theta roles\") is necessary for characterizing the semantic relations that a predicate can have to its arguments.",
        "This would seem to be one obvious starting-point for choosing a tag set for semantically annotating corpora, but there is no agreement as to the size of the minimal necessary set of \"universal\" roles.",

        "A semantic annotation of the constituents must identify at least",
        "• the action or state associated with the verb, possibly expressed in terms of primitives or some kind of metalanguage; • the participants (normally expressed as arguments); and • the roles of the participants in the action or state.",
        "A basic parse will identify the sentence's syntactic constituents; from the point of view of the head verb cure, then, a semantic annotation should reveal the mapping between the syntactic constituents and the frame-semantic elements they instantiate.",
        "In sentence (1) above, for example, the grammatical subject \"the waters of the spa\" corresponds to the thematic causer of the curing effect on the entity expressed as \"arthritis\", the verb's syntactic direct object and its thematic patient.2 However, there is something incomplete about such an analysis: it fails to anchor the arguments of",
        "cure within a \"generic medical event\" where it would be understood that the disease (arthritis) must be borne by some sufferer, and that a sufferer undergoing a treatment is participating as a patient in such an event.",
        "We identify such \"generic events\" as frames, and express our understanding of the structure of such events and the relationship of linguistic material to them in terms of the theory of frame semantics."

        "In frame semantics we take the view that word meanings are best understood in reference to the conceptual structures which support and motivate them.",
        "We believe, therefore, that any description of word meanings must begin by identifying such underlying conceptual structures.3 Frames have many properties of stereotyped scenarios – situations in which speakers expect certain events to occur and states to obtain.4 In general, frames encode a certain amount of \"real-world knowledge\" in schematized form.",
        "Consider the common scenario which exemplifies the commercial transaction frame: the elements of such frames are the individuals and the props that participate in such transactions (which we call FRAME ELEMENTS): the individuals in this case are the two protagonists in the transaction; the props are the two objects that undergo changes of ownership, one of them being money.",
        "Some frames encode patterns of opposition that human beings are aware of through everyday experience, such as our awareness of the direction of gravitational forces; still others reflect knowledge of the structures and functions of objects, such as knowledge of the parts and functions of the human body.",
        "The study of the frames which enter into human cognition is itself a huge field of research – we do not claim to know in advance how much frame knowledge must be specifically encoded in frame descriptions to make them useful for either linguistic or NLP purposes.",
        "We expect to be able to draw tentative conclusions about this based on what we find in corpora.",

        "More complicated cases require more elaborated frames.",
        "Thus, \"buy a house with a 30-year mort-gage\" involves a different frame from buying a candy bar, and entails a slightly different interpretation of the PAYMENT element.",
        "The relationship between frames is frequently hierarchical; for example, the frame elements BUYER, SELLER, PAYMENT, and GOODS will be common to all commercial transactions; the purchase of real estate contains all of them and (typically) adds a LOAN and a bank (typically) as LENDER.",
        "In our database, these two frames might",

        "would have to recognize Susan as playing slightly different roles in the two associated frames.",
        "A similar problem in using labels from frame semantic descriptions in the tagging of corpus lines is due to the fact that separate parts of any single sentence can evoke different semantic frames.",

        "In seeing this sentence merely as an expression evoking the commercial transaction frame, we could begin by tagging the subject of the sentence, \"George's cousin\", as the BUYER, and the object, \"a new Mer-cedes\" as the GOODS, and the oblique object, \"her portion of the inheritance\", marked by the preposition \"with\", as the PAYMENT.",
        "This could be done in a fairly natural and transparent way, as long as the tags were clearly seen as the names of frame elements specifically related to the head verb \"bought\" in that sentence.",

        "In the case of \"inheritance\", for example, the information that it gets used for buying something will make clear that this is an instance of estate-inheritance rather than genetic inheritance (or frame inheritance!",
        "), and the phrasing \"her portion\" fits frame understandings about the distribution of an inheritance among multiple heirs.",

        "Our direct purpose is not to create tagged corpora, but to tag enough corpus lines to allow us to make reliable generalizations on the meanings and on the semantic and syntactic valence of the lexical entries we have set out to describe.",
        "Whether we choose to tag more than what we need for our analysis will depend on the extent to which the process becomes automated and the resources available.",
        "Identifying the semantic frame associated with a word and the FEs with which it constellates does not, of course, constitute a complete representation of the word's meaning, and our semantic descriptions will not be limited to just this.",
        "However, we believe that such an analysis is a prerequisite to a theoretically sound semantic formalization.8 While any given frame description could be made more precise for other NLP/AI purposes (such as inference-generation), the development of such a formalism is not a central part of our current work.",
        "For our present purposes, the adequacy of lists of frame elements such as what we present in Table 1 for the vocabulary domain of health care can be established only if precisely these elements are the ones that are needed for distinguishing the semantic and combinatorial properties of the major lexical items that belong to that domain.",
        "An initial formulation of the combinatorial requirements and privileges of a frame's lexical members – here we concentrate on verbs – can be presented as a list of the groups of FEs that may be syntactically expressed or perhaps merely implied in the phrases that accompany the word.",
        "A Frame Element Group (FEG) is a list of the FEs from a given frame which occur in a phrase or sentence headed by a given word.",
        "Table 2 gives examples of such FEGs (including FEGs with only one member) paired with sentences whose constituents instantiate them.",
        "For purposes of this discussion, the frame elements are identified here using single letter abbreviations, and the structure of an FEG is shown as being merely a bracketed list.",
        "We recognize such a naming scheme is inadequate for a large annotation project, and certainly the representation of FEG structures will have to be more powerful.",
        "These, however, are minor problems with technical solutions.",
        "We focus below on other major issues we are confronting in interpreting the structure of frames as expressed by FEGs.",
        "At the lexicographic level of description we could simply list the full set of FEGs for a given lexical unit.",
        "However, in many cases the FEG potential of a verb can be expressed in one or more simplifying formulas, by, for example, recognizing some FEs as optional.",
        "Thus, since we find both {H, B} (\"The doctor cured my foot\") and 111, B, T1 (\"The doctor cured my foot with a new treatment\"), both sentences are using the verb cure in the same sense, we can represent both patterns in a single formula that treats the T element as an optional adjunct",
        "It will not be quite that automatic, however; further distinctions are needed.",
        "For example, while we can agree that the TREATMENT element in the previous examples was merely unmentioned, the omission of the DISEASE element in a sentence like \"The doctor cured me\" has a somewhat different status: there is clearly some DISEASE that the speaker has in mind, and its omission is licensed by the assumption that its nature is given in the context.",
        "That is, a possible \"of\" phrase was omitted from that sentence because its content had been previously mentioned or could otherwise be assumed to be known to both conversation participants.",

        "There are cases where different but related senses of a predicate have distinct FEG possibilities.",
        "For example, the verb heal has two uses, one of which participates in a Causative/Inchoative valency alternation (Levin, 1993) and one which does not.",
        "In the use where it refers to the growth of new tissue over a wound, it can be found in both transitive and intransitive clauses: \"The cut healed\" ({W}) and \"The ointment healed the cut\" (the ointment facilitated the natural process of healing – {M, W}).",
        "But there is also a purely transitive use with a meaning very close to that of cure, with {H, D} or {M, D}, as in \"The shaman healed my influenza\" or \"The waters healed my arthritis\", and this use of heal usually implies something extra-medical or supernatural.",
        "In this usage, there is no corresponding intransitive \"*My influenza/arthritis healed.\" The verb sense distinctions we make may sometimes be less detailed than those appearing in most dictionaries, since, as many researchers have noted, dictionary sense distinctions are often overprecise and incorporate pragmatic and world knowledge that do not properly speaking inhere in the word itself.",
        "An excellent example of this kind of excessive distinction is pointed out in (Ruhl, 1989), p.7: one of the dictionary definitions of break is \"to rupture the surface of and permit flowing out or effusing\" as in He broke an artery.",
        "On the other hand, we would expect to capture by this process all the kinds of alternations that (Levin, 1993) has shown to be linked to semantic distinctions, some of them quite subtle.",
        "The final versions of the lexical entries will encompass full semantic/syntactic valence descriptions, where the elements of each FEG associated with a verb sense will be linked to a specification of sortal features, indicating the \"selectional\" and syntactic properties of the constituents that can instantiate them."

        "We have suggested a theoretical basis and a working methodology for coming up with an appropriate set of semantic tags for the semantic frame elements, and believe that such frames may constitute a sort of \"basic level\" of lexical semantic description.",
        "As",
        "such they would be an appropriate starting-point for both a broad-coverage semantic lexicon and for the semantic tagging of corpora.",
        "We have also pointed out the importance of incorporating the notions of inheritance and other sub-structuring conventions in tagsets to reduce the size and complexity of the descriptions and to capture generalizations over natural classes.",
        "We recognize several shortcomings with our approach which we hope to be able to address in the future.",
        "First, it is clear that the size of the descriptions will increase rapidly as the annotation proceeds and we will need to find some explicit means of abbreviating representations, of collapsing FEGs in a principled way, and of relating frames together (both within and across semantic fields).",
        "This is both a practical and theoretical problem.",
        "We have shown a few clear examples in which the judicious use of the notion of inheritance, along the general lines of the ACQUILEX Project (Briscoe et al., 1993), should permit the concise representation of the lexical knowledge required to give a useful and relatively complete description of a word's semantic range.",
        "If the valence description (the FEG together with links to grammatical functions) associated with individual words is attached to each valence-bearing lexical token in a corpus, then if the corpus is parsed according to the same criteria by which the linking has been stated, we can avoid the problem of actually tagging the phrases that instantiate frame elements (and hence avoid the problem of multiple tagging for constituents that figure in more than one frame in the same sentence), because the constituents that play specific semantic roles in the sentence can be computed from the parse.",
        "The ability to accomplish something like that is desirable, but it is not something to which we are presently committed.",
        "We intend first to focus on prototypical or core uses of the words.",
        "However, our preliminary research indicates that it would be difficult, and undesirable, to exclude metaphorical uses, if only because the metaphorical uses can often shed light on the structure of the core uses.",
        "However, we are limiting our attention to a limited number of semantic domains, and metaphorical extensions from the words in our wordlist that go far beyond our semantic fields will probably have to be set aside.",
        "Finally, we should make a few remarks on the scope of our intended effort.",
        "We plan to create a \"starter lexicon\" containing some 5,000 lexical items indexed to examples of their use.",
        "With each entry we shall associate token frequencies with the various FEGs for each word sense, in order to assist NLP programs in picking likely interpretations.",
        "Initially the frequencies would be generated using our hand-tagged corpus examples; eventually we hope to be able to train on the hand-tagged examples and ultimately automate (at least partially) the tagging of instances, at least for preliminary word sense disambiguation, to be reviewed by a researcher.",
        "The automatic categorization of the arguments would use such information as WordNet synonyms and hy-pernyms (cf. (Resnik, 1993)), machine-readable thesauri, etc.,"
