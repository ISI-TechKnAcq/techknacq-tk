        "State-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) is bad at translating names that are not very common, particularly across languages with different character sets and sound systems.",
        "For example, consider the following automatic translation: SMT output musicians such as Bach",
        "Correct translation composers such as Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven, Schumann, Rachmaninoff, Ravel and Prokofiev",
        "The SMT system drops most names in this example.",
        "\"Name dropping\" and mistranslation happens when the system encounters an unknown word, mistakes a name for a common noun, or trains on noisy parallel data.",
        "The state-of-the-art is poor for two reasons.",
        "First, although names are important to human readers, automatic MT scoring metrics (such as BLEU) do not encourage researchers to improve name translation in the context of MT.",
        "Names are vastly outnumbered by prepositions, articles, adjectives, common nouns, etc.",
        "Second, name translation is a hard problem – even professional human translators have trouble with names.",
        "Here are four reference translations taken from the same corpus, with mistakes underlined:",
        "Refl composers such as Bach, missing name Chopin, Beethoven, Shumann.",
        "Rakmaninov.",
        "Ravel and Prokoviev",
        "Ref2 musicians such as Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Bethoven.",
        "Shuman.",
        "Rachmaninoff, Rafael and Brokoviev",
        "Ref3 composers including Bach, Mozart, Schopen, Beethoven, missing name Raphael, Rahmaniev and Brokofien",
        "Ref4 composers such as Bach, Mozart, missing name Beethoven, Schumann, Rachmaninov, Raphael and Prokofiev",
        "The task of transliterating names (independent of end-to-end MT) has received a significant amount of research, e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Al-Onaizan, 2002).",
        "One approach is to \"sound out\" words and create new, plausible target-language spellings that preserve the sounds of the source-language name as much as possible.",
        "Another approach is to phonetically match source-language names against a large list of target-language words and phrases.",
        "Most of this work has been disconnected from end-to-end MT, a problem which we address head-on in this paper.",
        "The simplest way to integrate name handling into SMT is: (1) run a named-entity identification system on the source sentence, (2) transliterate identified entities with a special-purpose transliteration component, and (3) run the SMT system on the source sentence, as usual, but when looking up phrasal translations for the words identified in step 1, instead use the transliterations from step 2.",
        "Many researchers have attempted this, and it does not work.",
        "Typically, translation quality is degraded rather than improved, for the following reasons:",
        "• Automatic named-entity identification makes errors.",
        "Some words and phrases that should not be transliterated are nonetheless sent to the transliteration component, which returns a bad translation.",
        "Not all named entities should be transliterated.",
        "Many named entities require a mix of transliteration and translation.",
        "For example, in the pair LjjjJLJLT j_L>./jnub kalyfurnya/Southern California, the first Arabic word is translated, and the second word is transliterated.",
        "Transliteration components make errors.",
        "The base SMT system may translate a commonly-occurring name just fine, due to the bitext it was trained on, while the transliteration component can easily supply a worse answer.",
        "• Integration hobbles SMT's use of longer phrases.",
        "Even if the named-entity identification and transliteration components operate perfectly, adopting their translations means that the SMT system may no longer have access to longer phrases that include the name.",
        "For example, our base SMT system translates (j*JJ",
        "(as a whole phrase) to \"Premier Li Peng\", based on its bitext knowledge.",
        "However, if we force *_L; to translate as a separate phrase to \"Li Peng\", then the term becomes ambiguous (with translations including \"Prime Minister\", \"Premier\", etc.",
        "), and we observe incorrect choices being subsequently made.",
        "To spur better work in name handling, an ACE entity-translation pilot evaluation was recently developed (Day, 2007).",
        "This evaluation involves a mixture of entity identification and translation concerns – for example, the scoring system asks for coreference determination, which may or may not be of interest for improving machine translation output.",
        "In this paper, we adopt a simpler metric.",
        "We ask: what percentage of source-language named entities are translated correctly?",
        "This is a precision metric.",
        "We can readily apply it to any base SMT system, and to human translations as well.",
        "Our goal in augmenting a base SMT system is to increase this percentage.",
        "A secondary goal is to make sure that our overall translation quality (as measured by BLEU) does not degrade as a result of the name-handling techniques we introduce.",
        "We make all our measurements on an Arabic/English newswire translation task.",
        "Our overall technical approach is summarized here, along with references to sections of this paper:",
        "We build a component for transliterating between Arabic and English (Section 3).",
        "We automatically learn to tag those words and phrases in Arabic text, which we believe the transliteration component will translate correctly (Section 4).",
        "We integrate suggested transliterations into the base SMT search space, with their use controlled by a feature function (Section 5).",
        "We evaluate both the base SMT system and the augmented system in terms of entity translation accuracy and Bleu (Sections 2 and 6)."

        "Dropping a comma or a the is penalized as much as dropping a name.",
