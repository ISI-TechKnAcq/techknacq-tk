        "Recent work on coreference resolution has shown that a rich feature space that models lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena is crucial to successfully address the task (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).",
        "When such a rich representation is available, even a simple deterministic model can achieve state-of-the-art performance (Haghighi and",
        "Klein, 2009).",
        "By and large most approaches decide if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over all these features and information local to the two mentions.",
        "This is problematic for two reasons: (1) lower precision features may overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones, and (2) local information is often insufficient to make an informed decision.",

        "Most state-of-the-art models will incorrectly link we to the israelis because of their proximity and compatibility of attributes (both we and the israelis are plural).",
        "In contrast, a more cautious approach is to first cluster the israelis with israel because the de-monymy relation is highly precise.",
        "This initial clustering step will assign the correct animacy attribute (inanimate) to the corresponding geopolitical entity, which will prevent the incorrect merging with the mention we (animate) in later steps.",
        "We propose an unsupervised sieve-like approach to coreference resolution that addresses these issues.",
        "The approach applies tiers of coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision.",
        "Each tier builds on the entity clusters constructed by previous models in the sieve, guaranteeing that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones.",
        "Furthermore, each model's decisions are richly informed by sharing attributes across the mentions clustered in earlier tiers.",
        "This ensures that each decision uses all of the information available at the time.",
        "We implemented all components in our approach using only deterministic models.",
        "All our components are unsupervised, in the sense that they do not require training on gold coreference links.",
        "The contributions of this work are the following:",

        "Our work reinforces this observation, and extends it by proposing a novel architecture that: (a) allows easy deployment of such features, and (b) infuses global information that can be readily exploited by these features or constraints.",
        "Most coreference resolution approaches perform the task by aggregating local decisions about pairs of mentions (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Finkel and anov, 2010).",

        "Haghighi and Klein (2010) propose a generative approach that models entity clusters explicitly using a mostly-unsupervised generative model.",
        "As previously mentioned, our work is not constrained by first-order or Bayesian formalisms in how it uses cluster information.",
        "Additionally, the deterministic models in our tiered model are significantly simpler, yet perform generally better than the complex inference models proposed in these works.",
        "From a high level perspective, this work falls under the theory of shaping, defined as a \"method of successive approximations\" for learning (Skinner, 1938).",
        "This theory is known by different names in many NLP applications: Brown et al.",
        "(1993) used simple models as \"stepping stones\" for more complex word alignment models; Collins (1999) used \"cautious\" decision list learning for named entity classification; Spitkovsky et al.",
        "(2010) used \"baby steps\" for unsupervised dependency parsing, etc.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this theory to coreference resolution."
