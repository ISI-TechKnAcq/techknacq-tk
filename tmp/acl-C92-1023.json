        "The paper develops further the idea of using the notion of the stock of shared knowledge (SSK) for anaphora resolution following a more subtle treatment of the influence of the topic/focus articulation of the sentence on the degrees of salience of items of the SSK.",
        "An algorithmic evaluation procedure of the SSK is formulated taking into account the notions of contextual boundness, syntactic associations, complexity of the sentences and existence/nonexistence of possible competitors, and a general evaluating function is proposed, essential for the process of anaphora resolution.",
        "In the present paper the analysis is performed for Czech; however, the considerations are claimed to be of a universal validity, the actual relations between different factors and the values, of course, being language-dependent.",
        "In our paper at Coling'90 we followed up the investigations presented in Haji6ovA, Vrbova (1982) and proposed an algorithm for solving pronominal anaphora with the use of \"stock of shared knowledge\" (SSK) - an abstract representation of the hierarchy of salience of the items of the knowledge assumed by the speaker to be shared by him and the hearer.",
        "The changes of degrees of salience were dependent solely on the bipolar division of the sentence into its topic and focus parts, respectively.",
        "In particular, the rules for computing the degrees of salience were specified as follows:",
        "(i) the items referred to in the focus part of the utterance be it by a noun or by a stressed pronoun receive the highest degree of salience (MAX); (ii) the items referred to by a noun in the topic part of the sentence are activated one degree less (MAX-1) than the items referred to in the focus part; (iii) a pronominal reference to an item in the topic part of the utterance keeps the activation unchanged; (iv) the items not mentioned in the given utterance subtract two degrees from their previous activation.",
        "As we stated already in the above mentioned paper, this was only a tentative solution on the way to a more sophisticated approach to organizing \"common knowledge\" or the speaker and the hearer.",
        "Supported by a thorough linguistic analysis of a large amount of Czech prosaic texts Hoskovec (1989), two possible improvements to the procedure have been suggested HajieovA, Hoskovec, Sgall (in press), namely: (i) to replace the binary account of topic/focus articulation of the sentence by a more atomic distinction between the contextually bound and non-bound elements of the sentence, thus enriching the numerical system of possible degrees of salience; (ii) to account explicitly for the empirical observations that items mentioned throughout the discourse are more likely to be referred to than those mentioned only once.",
        "In this paper we would like to argue that other important features should be taken into account in building the new evaluation system for the SSK.",
        "We believe that for a more sophisticated treatment of pronominal anaphora, an account of SSK must also allow for: (iii) a reflection of the topology of the surface structure of the text, in the simpliest form in terms of the distance of the possible antecedent and a refering expression measured by the number of interfering objects between them with respect to the sentence and paragraph boundaries; (iv) a capturing of some associations between lexical units describing objects in the text.",
        "We have limited our attention only to syntactic associations between governing and dependent words in the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "More general treatment of associations requires the use of semantic and/or pragmatic information (eg.",
        "semantic features, knowledge base etc.)",
        "which is not taken into consideration in the present version of the algorithm, but forms a promising subject of further investigations of possible improvements of the algorithm.",
        "Taking these observations into account, we present a new, enriched model of SSK here.",
        "In Section 2 we briefly discuss the relevance of the above mentioned features for anaphora resolution.",
        "Section 3 gives a proposal of the organization of SSK, together with the rules evaluating changes in degrees of salience of its items and a general algorithm for reference assignment based on the use of SSK.",
        "The possibility of customizing the algorithm for the purposes of a special language under consideration (in our case Czech) is discussed in Section 4."

        "( This case is rather rare and we do not consider it in our analysis for the sake of simplicity.)",
        "(iv) T consists of all the nodes not contained in F. Thus, for the purpose of this paper, only the difference between NB nodes and CB nodes on the first level of dependency is taken into consideration while specifying TFA of a sentence.",
