        "Two central challenges for dialogue systems are interpreting user utterances and selecting system dialogue moves.",
        "Recent years have seen an increased focus on data-driven techniques for addressing these challenging tasks (Bangalore et al., 2008; Frampton & Lemon, 2009; Hardy et al., 2006; Sridar et al., 2009; Young et al., 2009).",
        "Much of this work utilizes dialogue acts, built on the notion of speech acts (Austin, 1962), which provide a valuable intermediate representation that can be used for dialogue management.",
        "Data-driven approaches to dialogue act interpretation have included models that take into account a variety of lexical, syntactic, acoustic, and prosodic features for dialogue act tagging task-oriented domains, recent work has approached dialogue act classification by learning dialogue management models entirely from human-human corpora (Bangalore et al., 2008; Chotimongkol, 2008; Hardy et al., 2006).",
        "Our work adopts this approach for a corpus of human-human dialogue in a task-oriented tutoring domain.",
        "Unlike the majority of task-oriented domains that have been studied to date, our domain involves the separate creation of a persistent artifact, in our case a computer program, by the user during the course of the dialogue.",
        "Our corpus consists of human-human textual dialogue utterances and a separate, parallel stream of user-generated task actions.",
        "We utilize structural features including task/subtask, speaker, and hidden dialogue state along with lexical and syntactic features to interpret user (student) utterances.",
        "This paper makes three contributions.",
        "First, it addresses representational issues in creating a dialogue model that integrates task actions with hierarchical task/subtask structure.",
        "The task is captured within a separate synchronous event stream that exists in parallel with the dialogue.",
        "Second, this paper explores the performance of dialogue act classifiers using different lexical/syntactic and structural feature sets.",
        "This comparison includes one model trained entirely on lexical/syntactic features, an important step toward robust unsupervised dialogue act tagging (Sridhar et al., 2009).",
        "Finally, it investigates whether the addition of HMM and task/subtask features improves the performance of the dialogue act classifiers.",
        "The findings support this hypothesis for three student dialogue moves, each with important implications for tutorial dialogue."

        "A variety of modeling approaches have been investigated for statistical dialogue act classification, including sequential approaches and vector-based classifiers.",
        "Sequential approaches typically formulate dialogue as a Markov chain in which an observation depends on a finite number of preceding observations.",
        "HMM-based approaches make use of the Markov assumption in a doubly stochastic framework that allows fitting optimal dialogue act sequences using the Viterbi algorithm (Rabiner, 1989; Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Like this work, the approach reported here adopts a first-order Markov formulation to train an HMM on sequences of dialogue acts, but the prediction of this HMM is subsequently encoded in a feature vector for training a vector-based classifier.",
        "Vector-based approaches, such as maximum entropy modeling, also frequently take into account both lexical/syntactic and structural features.",
        "Lexical and syntactic cues are extracted from local utterance context, while structural features involve longer dialogue act sequences and, in task-oriented domains, task/subtask history.",
        "Work by Bangalore et al.",
        "(2008) on learning the structure of human-human dialogue in a catalogue-ordering domain (also extended to the Maptask and Switchboard corpora) utilizes features including words, part of speech tags, supertags, and named entities, and structural features including dialogue acts and task/subtask labels.",
        "In order to perform incremental decoding of dialogue acts and task/subtask structure, they take a greedy approach that does not require the search of complete dialogue sequences.",
        "Our work also accomplishes left-to-right incremental interpretation with a greedy approach.",
        "Our feature vectors differ from the aforementioned work slightly with respect to lexical/syntactic features and notably in the addition of a set of structural features generated by a separately trained HMM, as described in Section 4.2.",
        "Recent work has explored the use of lexical, syntactic, and prosodic features for online dialogue act tagging (Sridhar et al., 2009); that work explores the notion that structural (history) features could be omitted altogether from incremental left-to-right decoding, resulting in computationally inexpensive and robust dialogue act classification.",
        "Although our textual dialogue does not feature prosodic cues, we report on the use of lexical/syntactic features alone to perform dialogue act classification, a step toward a fully unsupervised approach.",
        "Like Bangalore et al.",
        "(2008), we treat task structure as an integral part of the dialogue model.",
        "Other work that has taken this approach includes the Amiti√©s project, in which a dialogue manager for a financial domain was derived entirely from a human-human corpus (Hardy et al., 2006).",
        "The TRIPS dialogue system also closely integrated task and dialogue models, for example, by utilizing the task model to facilitate indirect speech act interpretation (Allen et al., 2001).",
        "Work on the Maptask corpus has modeled task structure in the form of conversational games (Wright Hastie et al., 2002).",
        "Recent work in task-oriented domains has focused on learning task structure with unsupervised approaches (Chotimongkol, 2008).",
        "Emerging unsupervised methods, such as for detecting actions in multiparty discourse, also implicitly capture a task structure (Purver et al., 2006).",
        "Our domain differs from the task-oriented domains described above in that our dialogues center on the user creating a persistent artifact of intrinsic value through a separate, synchronous stream of task actions.",
        "To illustrate, consider a catalogue-ordering task in which one subtask is to obtain the customer's name.",
        "The fulfillment of this subtask occurs entirely through the dialogue, and the resulting artifact (a completed order) is produced by the system.",
        "In contrast, our task involves the user constructing a solution to a computer programming problem.",
        "The fulfillment of this task occurs partially in the dialogue through tutoring, and partially in a separate synchronous stream of user-driven task actions about which the tutor must reason.",
        "The stream of user-driven task actions produces an artifact of value in itself (a functioning computer program), and that artifact is the subject of much of the dialogue.",
        "We propose a representation that integrates task actions and dialogue acts from these streams into a shared vector-based representation, and we investigate the use of the resulting structural, lexical, and syntactic features for dialogue act classification."

        "The corpus captures approximately 48 hours of dialogue and contains 1,468 student utterances and 3,338 tutor utterances.",
        "Because the dialogue was textual, utterance segmentation consisted of splitting at existing sentence boundaries when more than one dialogue act was present in the utterance.",
        "This segmentation was conducted manually by the principal dialogue act annotator.",
        "The corpus was manually annotated with dialogue act labels and task/subtask features.",

        "These task actions were recorded as a separate event stream in parallel with the dialogue corpus.",

        "A total of 3,793 aggregated student subtask actions were identified through manual annotation.",
        "The task annotation scheme is hierarchical, reflecting the nested nature of the subtasks.",
        "A subset of this task annotation scheme is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "In the models reported in this paper, the 66 leaves of the task/subtask hierarchy were encoded in the input feature vectors.",
        "Each group of task events that occurred between dialogue utterances was tagged, possibly with many subtask labels, by a human judge.",
        "The judge aggregated the raw task keystrokes and tagged the task/subtask hierarchy for each cluster.",
        "(Please see Excerpt 1 in the appendix.)",
        "A second judge tagged 20% of the corpus in a reliability study for which one-to-one subtask identification was not enforced, an approach that was intended to give judges maximum flexibility to cluster task actions and subsequently apply the tags.",
        "All unmatched subtask tags were treated as disagreements.",
        "The resulting kappa statistic at the leaves was k= 0.58.",

        "overall, this classifier achieved 62.8% accuracy in tenfold cross-validation on the corpus.",
        "This performance is on par with other automatic dialogue act tagging models, both sequential and vector-based, in task-oriented domains that do not feature complex, user-driven parallel tasks.",
        "in a catalogue ordering domain with an integrated task and dialogue model, Bangalore et al.",
        "(2009) report 75% classification accuracy for user utterances using a maximum entropy classifier, a 275% improvement over baseline.",
        "classification accuracy by utilizing conversational game structure and speaker changes in the Maptask corpus, an improvement of 170% over baseline.",
        "Recent work on Maptask reports a classification accuracy of 65.7% using local utterance (such as lexical/syntactic) features alone, with prosodic cues yielding further slight improvement (sridhar et al., 2009).",
        "This classifier is analogous to our lexical/syntactic feature model, which achieved 60.2% accuracy.",
        "The results of these models demonstrate that, consistent with the findings in other task-oriented domains, lexical/syntactic features are highly useful for classifying student dialogue moves in this complex task-oriented domain.",
        "Models trained using those lexical/syntactic features performed almost universally better (with the exception of the binary classifier for GREETiNG) than models that were given the same left context of true dialogue act tags.",
        "it was hypothesized that leveraging both the hidden dialogue state and hierarchical subtask features would improve the performance of the classifiers.",
        "There is some evidence that the subtask structure was helpful for the overall classifier; however, no HMM features were kept during feature selection for the overall model.",
        "of the binary models, approximately half performed better than the overall model in terms of true positive rate; of those, three did so by including HMM or task/subtask features among the selected attributes to differentiate different tones of student feedback.",
        "However, this difference in performance was not statistically reliable.",
        "This finding suggests that, given lexical and syntactic features which are strong predictors of dialogue acts, the hidden dialogue state as captured by an an HMM may not contribute significantly to the dialogue act classification task."

        "Dialogue modeling for complex task-oriented domains poses significant challenges.",
        "An effective dialogue model allows systems to detect user dialogue acts so that they can respond in a manner that maximizes the chance of success.",
        "Experiments with the data-driven classifiers presented in this paper demonstrate that lexical/syntactic features can effectively classify student dialogue acts in the task-oriented tutoring domain.",
        "For POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, and Uncertain Elaborated student feedback acts, which play a key role in tutorial dialogue system, the addition of hidden dialogue state features (as learned by an HMM) and task/subtask features (annotated manually) improve classification accuracy, but not statistically reliably.",
        "The overarching goal of this work is to create a data-driven tutorial dialogue system that learns its behavior from corpora of effective human tutoring.",
        "The dialogue act classification models reported here constitute an important step toward that goal, by integrating the dialogue stream with a parallel user-driven task event stream.",
        "The next generation of data-driven systems should leverage models that capture the rich interplay between dialogue and task.",
        "Future work will focus on data-driven approaches to task recognition and tutorial planning.",
        "Additionally, as dialogue system research addresses increasingly complex task-oriented domains, it becomes increasingly important to investigate unsupervised approaches for dialogue act classification and task recognition.",
