        "Yet, far from being an obscure, endangered species, the noun compound is flourishing in modern language.",
        "It has already made five appearances in this paragraph and at least one diachronic study shows a veritable population explosion (Leonard, 1984).",
        "While substantial work on noun compounds exists in both linguistics (e.g. Levi, 1978; Ryder, 1994) and computational linguistics (Finin, 1980; McDonald, 1982; Isabelle, 1984), techniques suitable for broad coverage parsing remain unavailable.",
        "This paper explores the application of corpus statistics (Charniak, 1993) to noun compound parsing (other computational problems are addressed in Arens et al., 1987; Vanderwende, 1993 and Sproat, 1994).",

        "The parses assigned to these two compounds differ, even though the sequence of parts of speech are identical.",
        "The problem is analogous to the prepositional phrase attachment task explored in Hindle and Rooth (1993).",

        "There are at least four existing corpus-based algorithms proposed for syntactically analysing noun compounds.",
        "Only two of these have been subjected to evaluation, and in each case, no comparison to any of the other three was performed.",
        "In fact all authors appear unaware of the other three proposals.",
        "I will therefore briefly describe these algorithms.",
        "Three of the algorithms use what I will call the ADJACENCY MODEL, an analysis procedure that goes back to Marcus (1980, p253).",
        "Therein, the procedure is stated in terms of calls to an oracle which can determine if a noun compound is acceptable.",
        "It is reproduced here for reference: Given three nouns n1, n2 and n3:",
        "• If either [ni n2] or [n2 n3] is not semantically acceptable then build the alternative structure; • otherwise, if [n2 n3] is semantically preferable to [ni n21 then build [n2 ns]; • otherwise, build [ni n2].",
        "Only more recently has it been suggested that corpus statistics might provide the oracle, and this idea is the basis of the three algorithms which use the adjacency model.",
        "The simplest of these is reported in Pustejovsky et al. (1993).",
        "Given a three word compound, a search is conducted elsewhere in the corpus for each of the two possible subcomponents.",
        "Whichever is found is then chosen as the more closely bracketed pair.",
        "For example, when backup compiler disk is encountered, the analysis will be: Example 2",
        "(a) [backupN [compilerN diskN]] when compiler disk appears elsewhere (b) RbackupN compilerN] when backup compiler appears elsewhere",
        "Since this is proposed merely as a rough heuristic, it is not stated what the outcome is to be if neither or both subcomponents appear.",
        "Nor is there any evaluation of the algorithm.",
        "The proposal of Liberman and Sproat (1992) is more sophisticated and allows for the frequency of the words in the compound.",
        "Their proposal involves comparing the mutual information between the two pairs of adjacent words and bracketing together whichever pair exhibits the highest.",
        "Again, there is no evaluation of the method other than a demonstration that four examples work correctly.",
        "The third proposal based on the adjacency model appears in Resnik (1993) and is rather more complex again.",
        "The SELECTIONAL ASSOCIATION between a predicate and a word is defined based on the contribution of the word to the conditional entropy of the predicate.",
        "The association between each pair of words in the compound is then computed by taking the maximum selectional association from all possible ways of regarding the pair as predicate and argument.",
        "Whilst this association metric is complicated, the decision procedure still follows the outline devised by Marcus (1980) above.",
        "Resnik (1993) used unambiguous noun compounds from the parsed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus to estimate the association N alues and analysed a test set of around 160 compounds.",
        "After some tuning, the accuracy was about 73%, as compared with a baseline of 64% achieved by always bracketing the first two nouns together.",
        "The fourth algorithm, first described in Lauer (1994), differs in one striking manner from the other three.",
        "It uses what I will call the DEPENDENCY MODEL.",
        "This model utilises the following procedure when given three nouns ni, n2 and n3:",
        "• Determine how acceptable the structures [ni n2] and [ni n3] are; • if the latter is more acceptable, build [n2 n3] first; • otherwise, build [ni n2] first.",
        "Figure 1 shows a graphical comparison of the two analysis models.",
        "In Lauer (1994), the degree of acceptability is again provided by statistical measures over a corpus.",
        "The metric used is a mutual information-like measure based on probabilities of modification relationships.",
        "This is derived from the idea that parse trees capture the structure of semantic relationships within a noun compound.' The dependency model attempts to choose a parse which makes the resulting relationships as acceptable as possible.",
        "For example, when backup compiler disk is encountered, the analysis will be: Example 3",
        "(a) [backupN [compilerN disk4 when backup disk is more acceptable (b) RbackupN compilerN] disk1.11 when backup compiler is more acceptable",
        "I claim that the dependency model makes more intuitive sense for the following reason.",
        "Consider the compound calcium ion exchange, which is typically left-branching (that is, the first two words are bracketed together).",
        "There does not seem to be any reason why calcium ion should be any more frequent than ion exchange.",
        "Both are plausible compounds and regardless of the bracketing, ions are the object of an exchange.",
        "Instead, the correct parse depends on whether calcium characterises the ions or mediates the exchange.",
        "Another significant difference between the models is the predictions they make about the proportion 'Lauer and Dras (1994) give a formal construction motivating the algorithm given in Lauer (1994).",
        "of left and right-branching compounds.",
        "Lauer and Dras (1994) show that under a dependency model, left-branching compounds should occur twice as often as right-branching compounds (that is two-thirds of the time).",
        "In the test set used here and in that of Resnik (1993), the proportion of left-branching compounds is 67% and 64% respectively.",
        "In contrast, the adjacency model appears to predict a proportion of 50%.",
        "The dependency model has also been proposed by Kobayasi et al. (1994) for analysing Japanese noun compounds, apparently independently.",
        "Using a corpus to acquire associations, they bracket sequences of Kanji with lengths four to six (roughly equivalent to two or three words).",
        "A simple calculation shows that using their own preprocessing hueristics to guess a bracketing provides a higher accuracy on their test set than their statistical model does.",
