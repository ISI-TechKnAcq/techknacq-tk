        "Our motivation is to perform call routing of utterances without recourse to transcriptions of the training data, which are very expensive to obtain.",
        "We therefore use phonetic recognition of utterances and search for salient phonetic sequences within the decodings.",
        "An important issue in phonetic recognition is the language model.",
        "It has been demonstrated [1] that the use of an iterative language model gives benefits in speech recognition performance that are translated to improvements in utterance classification.",
        "However, an all-purpose language model sometimes produces decodings that are ambiguous, in that they apparently contain key phonetic sequences from several different routes, or non-informative, in that they apparently contain no useful phonetic sequences.",
        "This paper describes a method that uses multiple language models to detect useful information in such utterances.",
        "The outputs from recognizers that use these multiple models are examined by post-processing HMMs that decide whether putative sequences are present or not.",
        "It is found that using multiple language models increases performance significantly by classifying utterances that a single language model is unable to discriminate."

        "Call routing refers to the technique of automatically relaying a customer's telephone enquiry to one of several appropriate destinations, using computational speech and language processing techniques.",
        "Transcribing calls for training purposes for a particular application requires considerable human effort, and it would be preferable for the system to learn routes without transcriptions being provided [2].",
        "In this study, we assume that we are provided with a set of training utterances that have been labelled with their destination by an expert, but not transcribed into words or phonemes.",
        "We also assume (perhaps over-pessimistically) that we have no prior knowledge of the vocabulary or syntax of our application.",
        "In this situation, one possible course of action is to use phone recognition and attempt to identify phonetic sequences that are salient to particular routes.",
        "Unfortunately, the speech signals are often of very poor quality, being subject to the usual distortion, bandwidth restriction and noise associated with telephone signals, and often compounded by the fact that callers usually speak casually and spontaneously, and sometimes with a strong accent.",
        "Some approaches to the problem of extracting salient phonetic strings from these utterances are:",
        "• Improve phone accuracy by using a variable length language model and building models for insertion and substitution; [3,4] • Identify subword units (e.g. phonemes, phoneme",
        "strings, syllables and morphemes) from the recognised phonetic sequences by using clustering and segmentation methods; [5,6,7]",
        "• Use matrix-based methods for classification, such as",
        "LSA, LDA, ICA, SVM, etc.",
        "[8,9,10] Work at AT&T [1] showed that call routing performance using this phone-string utterance classification can be surprisingly close to what can be achieved by conventional methods involving word-trigram language models that require manual transcription.",
        "The method described in [1] combines automatic training of application-specific phonotactic language models together with token sequence classifiers.",
        "Our own experiments, using data different from that used by AT&T, showed that this technique gave only a small benefit in phone recognition accuracy, but was useful for finding salient phoneme strings.",
        "However, we found that, in some cases, it was impossible to obtain salient phoneme sequences from the recognised utterances even when it was known that they occurred within the utterance.",
        "The reason may be that when building a single language model with the collected utterances from all call routes, the salience of a particular sequence for a particular route is lost in the “noise” from mis-recognised sequences of phonemes from the other routes.",
        "Hence we sought a way of making the language model more sensitive to the keywords occurring in the utterances.",
        "In our system, an independent corpus is used to build an n-gram phonotactic language model that enables an initial recogniser to be built to decode all the training utterances.",
        "This model is refined iteratively using the output from the recogniser as the basis for the next language model.",
        "A specific language model for each call route is then built using the utterances from this call route.",
        "These are much more sensitive to key salient phoneme sequences in the utterance.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: in section 2, the data corpus used is introduced.",
        "Section 3 describes in detail the language modelling techniques, section 4 presents experiments and analysis of results, and we end with a Discussion in section 5.",
        "Figure 1 shows the method used to produce an initial language model.",
        "The algorithm follows that described in [1]:",
        "1.",
        "Build an n-gram language model (LM) using the dictionary transcriptions of the WSJ corpus (we used n=6).",
        "Make this the current LM.",
        "2.",
        "Use the current LM in the recognizer to produce a set of phone strings.",
        "3.",
        "Build a new LM based on the recognizer phone strings: 4.",
        "If niterations <=threshold, goto 2 else finish and produce a single language model for all routes.",
        "2.",
        "Database",
        "The application studied here was the enquiry-point for the store card for a large retail store.",
        "Customers were invited to call up the system and to make the kind of enquiry they would normally make when talking to an operator.",
        "Their calls were routed to 61 different destinations, although some destinations were used very infrequently.",
        "15 000 utterances were available, and a subset of 4511 utterances was used for training and 3518 for testing, in which 18 different call types were represented.",
        "Some of these call types are quite easily confused e.g. PaymentDue and PaymentDate, PaymentAddress and Changeaddress.",
        "Phoneme recognition of the input speech queries was performed using an HMM recogniser whose acoustic models had been trained on a large corpus of telephone speech and which had separate models for males and females.",
        "The average length of an utterance is 8.36 words.",
        "In addition, transcriptions of the prompts from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) database were used to generate phoneme-level statistical language models for initial training.",
        "These models were generated using a scheme for backing off to probability estimates for shorter n-grams.",
        "The size of the vocabulary is 1208 words.",
        "To get a feel for the difficulty of the task, the mutual information (MI) between each word and the classes was calculated.",
        "By setting a threshold on this figure, we observed that there were about 51 keywords occurring in 4328 utterances which were capable on their own of classifying a call with high accuracy (some utterances had no keywords)."

        "However, many utterances do not produce any sequences or produce several sequences from different routes.",
        "For recognition, we use a “divide and conquer” approach.",
        "Utterances that yield one or more sequences from the same route are classified immediately as that route, and utterances whose output is ambiguous, in that they yield no sequences, or sequences from several routes, or whose recognition confidence is too low to trust, are subject to a more detailed recognition pass in which separate LMs for each route are used.",

        "Putative sections of the speech that contain keywords are identified by comparing the symbolic output of a recognizer using a certain LM with the sequences that were used to form the HMMs of the clustered key phonetic sequences for this LM.",
        "These HMMs are then used to determine the likelihood of each sequence given the output string, and the utterance is assigned to the route of the highest likelihood.",
        "ELSEIF the number of key phonetic sequences is zero The utterance is not classified (rejected).",
        "Call type classification is done using a vector-based approach as described in [8].",
        "It is perhaps surprising that this classifier gets 100% accuracy (2553/2553) on utterances in which all the sequences are apparently from the same route – we attribute this to the fact that the 18 call-types were used were highly independent in their use of keywords."
