        "In this paper, we present an empirical study of the cognitive representations underpinning the uses of proximal descriptions in locative spatial expressions.",
        "A spatial locative expression consists of a locative prepositional phrase together with whatever the phrase modifies (noun, clause, etc.).",
        "In their simplest form, a locative expression consists of a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase, for example the man near the desk.",
        "People often use spatial locatives to denote objects in a visual scene.",
        "Understanding such references involves coordination between a perceptual event and a linguistic utterance.",
        "Consequently, the study of spatial locatives affords the opportunity to examine some aspects of the grounding of language in non-language.",
        "The conception of space underlying spatial locatives is fundamentally relativistic: the location of one object is specified relative to another whose location is usually assumed by the speaker to be known by the hearer.",
        "Moreover, underpinning this relativistic notion of space is the concept of proximity.",
        "Consequently, the notion of proximity is an important concept at the core of human spatial cognition.",
        "Proximal spatial relationships are often described using topological prepositions, e.g. at, on, near, etc.",
        "Terminology In this paper we use the term target (T) to refer to the head of a locative expression (the object which is being located by that expression) and the term landmark (L) to refer to the object in the prepositional phrase in that expression (relative to which the head’s location is described), see Example (1).",

        "Previous psycholinguistic work on proximal relations, (Logan and Sadler, 1996), has not examined the effects other objects in the scene (i.e., dis-tractors) may have on the spatial relationship between a landmark and a target.",
        "The experiment described in this paper compares peoples’ judgements of proximity between target and landmark objects when they are presented alone and when there are presented along with other distractor objects.",

        "In this section we review previous psycholinguistic experiments that examined proximal spatial relations.",
        "We then present example spatial contexts, that the previous experiments did not examine, which motivate the hypothesis tested in this paper: the location of other objects in a scene can interfere with the acceptability of a proximal description being used to describe the spatial relationship between a landmark and a target.",
        "ings for the relation near as a function of the position occupied by X. Spatial reasoning is a complex activity that involves at least two levels of representation and reasoning: a geometric level where metric, topological, and projective properties are handled, (Her-skovits, 1986); and a functional level where the normal function of an entity affects the spatial relationships attributed to it in context (for example, the meaning of ‘near’ for a bomb is quite different from the meaning of ‘near’ for other objects of the same size; (Vandeloise, 1991; Coventry, 1998; Garrod et al., 1999)).",
        "There has been a lot of experimental work done on spatial reasoning and language: (Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin, 1993; Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin, 1994; Hayward and Tarr, 1995; Gapp, 1995; Logan and Sadler, 1996; Carlson-Radvansky and Logan, 1997; Coventry, 1998; Garrod et al., 1999; Regier and Carlson, 2001; Kelleher and Costello, 2005).",
        "Of these only (Logan and Sadler, 1996) examined topological prepositions in a context where functional factors were excluded.",
        "The term spatial template denotes the representation of the regions of acceptability associated with a preposition.",
        "It is centred on the landmark and identifies for each point in its space the acceptability of the spatial relationship between the landmark and the target appearing at that point being described by the preposition (Logan and Sadler, 1996).",
        "The concept of a spatial template emerged from psycholinguistic experiments reported in (Logan and Sadler, 1996).",
        "These experiments examined various spatial prepositions.",
        "In these experiments, a human subject was shown sentences, each with a picture of a spatial configuration.",
        "Every sentence was of the form “The X is [relation] the O”.",
        "The accompanying picture contained an O in the center of an invisible 7-by-7 cell grid, and an X in one of the 48 surrounding positions.",
        "The subject then had to rate how well the sentence described the picture, on a scale from 1(bad) to 9(good).",
        "Figure 1 gives the mean goodness rating for the relation “near to” as a function of the position occupied by the X, as reported in (Logan and Sadler, 1996).",
        "If we plot the mean goodness rating for “near” against the distance between target X and landmark O, we get the graph in Figure 2.",
        "Both the figure and the graph make it clear that the ratings diminish as we increase the distance between X and O.",
        "At the same time, we can observe that even at the extremes of the grid the ratings were still above 1 (the minimum rating).",
        "In",
        "deed, in the four corners of the grid, the points most distant from the landmark, the mean ratings nearly average twice the minimum rating.",
        "However in certain contexts other factors, apart from the distance between the landmark and the target, affect the applicability of a proximal relation as a description of the target’s position relative to the landmark.",
        "For example, consider the two scenes (side-view) given in Figure 3.",
        "In the scene on the left-hand side, we can use the description “the blue box is near the black box” to describe object (a).",
        "However, consider now the scene on the right-hand side.",
        "In this context, the description “the blue box is near the black box” seems inappropriate as an expression describing (a).",
        "The placing of object (c) beside (b) would appear to interfere with the appropriateness of using a proximal relation to locate (a) relative to (b), even though the absolute distance between (a) and (b) has not changed.",
        "In summary, there is empirical evidence that indicates that as the distance between the landmark and the target increases the applicability of a proximal description decreases.",
        "Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence that the location of other distractor objects in context may interfere with applicability of a proximal description between a target and landmark object.",
        "The experiment presented in this paper is designed to empirically test the affect of distractor objects on proximity judgements."

        "Topological prepositions (e.g., at, on, in, near) are often used to describe proximal spatial relationships.",
        "However, the semantics of a given topological preposition also reflects functional (Garrod et al., 1999), directional (Logan and Sadler, 1996) and topological factors.1 Consequently, it was important to control for these factors during the design of the experiment.",

        "We test these hypotheses by varying target-distractor distance in our materials, but maintaining landmark-distractor distance constant.",

        "First, does the presence of a distractor make any noticable difference in people’s judgements of proximity?",
        "Second, if the presence of a distractor does influence proximity judgements, is this influence target-centered (based on the distance between the target object and the distractor) or landmark-centered (based on the distance between the landmark and the distractor).",
        "We address the first question (does the distractor object have an influence on proximity judgments) by comparing the results obtained for images in group x (in which there was no distractor) with results",
        "obtained from other groups.",
        "In particular, we compare the results from this group with those obtained from groups c, d and e: the three groups in which the distractor object is furthest from the set of target positions used (as Figure 4 shows, distractor positions c, d, and e are all on the opposite side of the landmark from the set of target positions).",
        "We focus on comparison with groups c, d, and e because results for the other groups are complicated by the fact that people’s proximity judgments are influenced by the closeness of a distractor object to the target (as we will see later).",
        "given by participants for the 6 targets 1 to 6 for group x (in which there was no distractor object) and for groups c, d, and e (in which distractors occurred on the opposite side of the landmark from the target).",
        "Clearly, all three sets of distractor responses are very similar to each other, and are all noticably different from the no-distractor response.",
        "This difference was shown to be statistically significant in a by-subjects analysis comparing subjects’ responses for groups c,d and e with their responses for group x.",
        "This comparison showed that subjects produced significantly lower proximity ratings for group c than group x",
        "for group e than group x (W+ = 51.50, W – = 3.50, N = 11, p <= 0.01).",
        "(We exclude one subject from this analysis because they mistakenly gave the lowest possible proximity rating of 0 to the item closest to the landmark in group x).",
        "These results show that the presence of a distractor object reliably influences people’s proximity judgements.",
        "But how does this influence operate?",
        "We examine this by comparing our experimental results with those expected by the target-centered and the landmark-centered hypotheses.",
        "We can formalise the landmark-centered hypothesis about proximity judgements as follows.",
        "Let T be the target whose proximity to the landmark we’re trying to judge, let L and D be the landmark and distractor objects respectively, and let dist(A, B) be the computed distance between",
        "two objects.",
        "Then under the landmark-centered hypothsis, the relationship between proximity and distance-to-landmark in our experiment should be as in Equation 1:",
        "Equation 1 states that the judged proximity of a target to a landmark rises as the target’s distance from the landmark falls (the closer the target is to the landmark, the higher its proximity score for the landmark will be), but falls as the distance between the landmark and the distractor falls (the closer the distractor is to the landmark, the lower the proximity score for the target will be).",
        "Recall, however, that in the design of our materials, the distance from landmark to distractor was kept constant.",
        "When applied to our materials, therefore, Equation 1 reduces to",
        "Equation 2 gives a good fit to people’s proximity judgments for targets in our experiment.",
        "For group x (the set of images for which there was no distractor object, just a target and the landmark), the correlation between dist(T, D) and people’s average proximity scores for target T was high (r = 0.95).",
        "The first graph in Figure 8 illustrates this correlation, comparing the average proximity value given by participants for each target in group x with the computed proximity value for each target in that group from Equation 2.",
        "We next compare our experimental data with the results expected by the target-centered hypothesis for proximity judgments.",
        "Under this hypothesis, the judged proximity of a target to a landmark rises as the target’s distance from the landmark decreases (the closer the target is to the landmark, the higher its proximity score for the landmark will be), but falls as the target’s distance from the distractor decreases (the closer the target is to the distractor, the lower its proximity score for the landmark will be).",
        "This relationship can be formalised as in Equation 3:",
        "Equation 3 states that if a target object is close to the landmark and far from the distractor it will have a high proximity score for that landmark.",
        "However, if it is close to the landmark and close to the distractor, its proximity score will be lower.",
        "The remaining seven graphs in Figure 8 assess this account by comparing the average proximity value given by participants for each target in the distractor groups a to g with the proximity value for each target in that group computed from Equation 2 (the landmark-centered equation) and with the proximity value for each target computed from Equation 3 (the target-centered equation).",
        "As these graphs show, for each group the proximity value computed from Equation 2 gives a fair match to people’s proximity judgements for target objects (the average correlation across the seven groups is around r = 0.93).",
        "However, the distance-to-distractor term in the computation of proximity in Equation 3 significantly improves the correlation in each graph, giving an average correlation across the seven groups of around r = 0.99.",
        "We conclude that participants’ proximity judgements for objects in our experiment are best represented by the model described in Equation 3, in which the proximity of a target to a landmark is a decreasing function of the target’s distance from that landmark and an increasing function of the target’s distance from distractor objects.",
        "Note that, in order to clearly display the relationship between proximity values given by participants for target objects, proximity computed in Equation 2 (using target-to-landmark distance only), and proximity computed in Equation 3 (using target-to-landmark and target-to-distractor distances) the values displayed in Figure 8 are normalised so that, across all groups and targets, the average proximity values given by participants have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, as do the proximity values computed in Equation 2 and those computed in Equation 3.",
        "This normalisation simply means that all values fall in the same region of the scale, and can be easily compared visually.",
        "This normalisation has no effect on the correlations obtained between the observed and computed proximity values."
