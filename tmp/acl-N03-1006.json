        "When such a dictionary is not available in an electronic format, an English-to-target-language hard-copy dictionary can be used (this was done for Slovene, with 35 minutes necessary to extract all the translations of the English seeds).",
        "This first approach is limited to the languages in which grammatical gender is related to natural gender.",
        "Also, the results may vary according to the usage of the selected natural gender nouns in the corpus (for example, words like niece or rooster may not be very frequent in newswire corpora).",
        "A second, more general approach is to extract from the corpus a list of nouns selected on the basis of frequency, number of contexts with which they co-occur, and suffix patterns, and to label them with gender information by dictionary lookup.",
        "This approach guarantees that the seeds used are representative for the given corpus, so that the bootstrapping has a better chance to succeed.",
        "On the other hand, it presumes the existence of a gender annotated mono or bilingual dictionary (which might be more difficult to find than an unannotated bilingual dictionary).",

        "Unfortunately, all neuter nouns are listed as masculine in this lexicon, probably because morphologically, neuters and masculine are alike in the singular â€“ for example, conac (tree) is masculine while conac (mansion) is neuter.",
        "Syntactically, neuter singular nouns occur in the same context as masculine singular nouns, so the gender agreement cannot be used to choose between the two class labels.",
        "Only 2,132 of the 17,053 known nouns appear in the corpus and we focus our attention on these nouns, as a relevant sample of nouns in the language.",
        "Starting from the English natural-gender words, seed nouns were obtained by projection using a scanned and OCRed bilingual Romanian-English dictionary.",
        "One major class of seed candidates were automatically and systematically eliminated, namely the multi-gender case where a male and female pair share the same translation (e.g. the masculine noun",
        "copil is a translation of both girl and boy, as well as daughter and son).",
        "All other seeds were retained (including poor ones) in order to avoid use of language-specific knowledge.",
        "For example, one of the Romanian seeds, fiu (son) is also a very frequent form of the verb a fi (to be), and therefore many verbal contexts are considered by the system from the beginning.",
        "One possible approach to correct this problem is to verify that the seeds extracted from the bilingual dictionary have only nominal meanings by checking them individually in a library dictionary.",
