        "In this paper we consider syntactic relations between words of a sentence that can be strongly predicted by local mechanisms.",
        "For instance, if a sentence contains a pair of words red block ..., then the reader immediately makes a conjecture that red is an adjective modifier for the noun block.",
        "The same is true for semantically abnormal pairs such as ... green ideas ... .",
        "Other examples of strong prediction are provided by pairs ... authors describe ... , ... problem is ... , for which a \"subject - verb\" relation takes place with high probability.",
        "In most cases, such simple hypotheses prove to be correct.",
        "However, sometimes they lead to errors, as for the pair problem is in the sentence (1) The solution of this problem is very simple.",
        "In this example, however, by the moment the word is has been read, the word problem is already engaged in other strongly predicted constructions, namely the prepositional phrase of this problem and even the whole noun phrase the solution of this problem.",
        "A conflict arises, and plausibility of the new hypothesis becomes much lower.",
        "Such syntactic relations may concern not only adjacent words.",
        "For instance, in (1) it is for the pair solution ... is that the \"subject - verb\" relation will be conjectured.",
        "In this paper, strong prediction of syntactic relations is modeled within the framework of dependency syntax (see MePark 1974, 1988).",
        "According to this theory, (surface) syntactic structure of a sentence is an oriented tree whose nodes are the words of the sentence (more precisely, their lexico-morphological interpretations).",
        "The arcs of the tree represent syntactic links between words and are labeled by names of syntactic relations.",
        "The result of strong prediction is a partial parse of the sentence, in which high-probability syntactic links are established.",
        "In our opinion, dependency structures are better adapted to partial parsing than constituent structures.",
        "The reason is that the dependency structure of a segment is the same both when the segment is considered as isolated and when it is considered as a part of some sentence (by \"segment\" we understand any sequence of words).",
        "Generally, this is not true for constituent structures.",
        "For instance, the segment I saw a man has the dependency structure •",
        "(2) 1-compl",
        "pred det I saw a – man both as a complete sentence and as a part of the sentence I saw a man with a telescope.",
        "The fact that the latter sentence is ambiguous does not hamper anything, as both its structures contain subtree (2) (and differ only in arcs that go into the word with):",
        "On the other hand, the constituent structure of the segment I saw a man is not fully inherited in the constituent structures of the longer sentence.",
        "In our opinion, this comparison demonstrates that, in a certain sense, dependency structures reflect the incremental nature of sentence comprehension from left to right better than constituent structures do.",
        "In this paper we describe a bottom-up, left-to-right algorithm of partial parsing that establishes high-probability syntactic links.",
        "It is implemented on a VAX 11/750 computer as a subsystem of a multipurpose linguistic processor developed in the Laboratory of Computational Linguistics of the Institute for Problems of Information Transmission, the Russian Academy of Sciences (Apresjan et al.",
        "1992).",
        "The partial parser is employed as a preprocessing unit before the operation of the main filter-type parser.",
        "It can also be used for automatic indexing and lemmatization.",
        "The algorithm is language-independent: all language-specific information is recorded in the dictionaries and the rules that establish links.",
        "• Full names of English syntactic relations that appear in examples are: predicative, determinative, 1st completive, prepositional, attributive, adverbial.",
        "The number of relations used In complete models of English and Russian syntax varies from 40 to 55 (MeEtbk 1974; Mel'euk and Pertsov 1987; Apresjan et al.",

        "The processing of a sentence begins with morphological analysis.",
        "As a result, each word is given a set of its possible lexico-morphological interpretations, henceforth called \"homonyms\".",
        "A homonym is a list that includes a lexeme identifier, a part-of-speech marker, and morphological features of the wordform.",
        "For instance, the morphological module of the ETAP-2 system (Apresjan et al.",
        "1989) will give for the word saw the following three homonyms: SEE, V, pt (-past tense); SAW1, V, mf (- main form); SAW2, N, sg.",
        "All morphological data are concentrated in a special morphological dictionary.",
        "The key role in parsing proper is played by a combinatorial (syntactic) dictionary that contains versatile information on syntactic properties of lexemes, i.e. on their ability to participate in various syntactic constructions (for details see Mertuk 1974, 1988; Apresjan et al.",
        "1989, 1992).",
        "The general scheme of parsing is as follows.",
        "After the morphological analysis, for each word there appears one or more homonyms.",
        "By \"fragment\" we shall understand a set of homonyms occupying one or more successive positions in the sentence (one homonym in each position) plus a tree of syntactic links defined on these homonyms as nodes.",
        "For instance, an isolated homonym is a trivial fragment; the whole dependency tree of a sentence is also a fragment.",
        "It should be noted that in trees (2) - (4) each word is represented by a certain homonym (for example, saw is represented by SEE, V, pt).",
        "Lejkina and Tsejtin (1975) described a bottom-up process for constructing dependency trees.",
        "It is based on the operation of adjunction.",
        "This operation is applied to two adjacent fragments and consists in establishing a link, marked by a certain syntactic relation, from a certain node of one fragment to the root of the other.",
        "The result of adjunction is a new fragment on the union of segments occupied by the initial fragments.",
        "This action is similar to generation of a new constituent from two adjacent constituents.",
        "However, unlike constituents, fragments at the moment of adjunction may be \"incomplete, i.e. they need not contain all the nodes that will be direct or indirect dependents of their roots in the structure of the sentence.",
        "These nodes may be added to them later (also by the operation of adjunction).",
        "Mitjushin (1985) described the class of trees that can be constructed from isolated homonyms by repeated adjunction, i.e. that can be built by the bottom-up process.",
        "Consider a tree with an ordered set of nodes.",
        "Let a \"tangle\" be a quadruple of nodes (a, b, c, d) with the following properties:",
        "1) a < b < c < d; 2) a and c are linked by an arc (in any direction); 3) b and d are linked by an arc (in any direction); 4) the path between a and d contains neither b nor c (here, orientation of arcs is ignored, so the path always exists).",
        "The following criterion is true: a tree can be constructed from its nodes by repeated adjunction if and only if it contains no tangles.",
        "The simplest tangle looks as follows:",
        "(direction of the arcs does not matter; there can be other nodes between a, b, c, and d).",
        "According to the criterion, a tree that contains such a subtree cannot be built by the bottom-up process.",
        "The class of trees obtainable by adjunction is much wider than the class of so-called projective trees (on projectivity see, for example, Gladkij 1985; Mereuk 1988).",
        "For the model of Russian syntax presented by Mernk (1974) and Apresjan et al.",
        "(1992), this class includes all syntactic structures permissible in scientific, technical, and business texts (however, it is not so for spoken language and poetry).",

        "We suppose that the correspondence between sentences and their syntactic structures is defined by some other means.",
        "The task of the parsing algorithm and the rules it employs is to build, for a given sentence, some set of its syntactic structures or their fragments, without losing the semantically correct ones.",
        "The concrete function of the rules is to check whether the given case of adjunction is feasible and, if so, to perform the operation of adjunction.",
        "Some additional operations can also be performed.",
        "The rules have access to any information about the structure of fragments to be adjoined and the homonyms they contain (their lexeme names, morphological features, and syntactic properties stated in the combinatorial dictionary).",
        "The rules may also use data on punctuation and limited data on homonyms not belonging to the given two fragments; they have no access to information about fragments built by the algorithm earlier.",
        "While formally the rules could be strongly context-sensitive within the limits of two given fragments, in most cases they only use information on nodes X and Y (those to be linked) and their nearest syntactic context.",
        "In fact, the rules currently emloyed do not consider nodes for which distance from X or Y exceeds 3 (where distance is the number of links in the path connecting two nodes in the dependency tree of a fragment).",
        "A rule is a program written in the form of a transition graph, with an elementary predicate or operation associated with each arc.",
        "The rule interpreter performs ordered search to find a path along \"true\" arcs that starts at a fixed entry node and ends at one of fixed exit nodes.",
        "No backtracking is used: if forward motion from some node proves to be impossible, interpretation is terminated.",
        "The fact that backtracking is not necessary has been discovered empirically; it is connected with the nature of syntactic events considered by the rules.",
        "On the other hand, when desirable, an explicit return may be made to a point passed earlier, with simple measures taken against infinite cycling.",
        "Each rule contains at least one operation LINK( X,Y,R) that establishes a link marked by a certain syntactic relation R between the given node X of one fragment and the root Y of the other (that is, performs the adjunction).",
        "The corpus of rules covers only those situations for which the probability that the established links are correct is estimated as close to 1.",
        "For instance, the rules do not establish links like attr and adv in structures (3) and (4) because attachment of prepositional postmodifiers is known as a \"classical\" case of structural ambiguity.",
        "It should be noted that the probability close to 1 characterizes here not individual links (it would be too strong a demand) but all complex of links established for the given words.",
        "This can be illustrated by the segment I saw, for which two fragments will be built with different homonyms for the word saw: pred pred I – SEE v,pt , SAW1 V,rnf Both these alternatives are syntactically correct.",
        "At the same time, they are mutually exclusive, and it is only their disjunction that has probability close to 1.",
        "This ambiguity is also inherited by larger fragments.",
        "(As a result, the sentence I saw a man with a telescope has four different parses, two of which are semantically abnormal.)",
        "Thus, high probability is a \"collective\" and not an \"individual\" property of links.",

        "All fragments of A (including isolated homonyms) become active successively, without leaps or returns.",

        "At the initial moment A contains a single element, namely one of the homonyms occupying the leftmost position of the sentence, and it is declared active.",
        "For each active fragment F the algorithm selects in A its left neighbors, i.e. fragments that are adjacent to F on its left.",

        "To improve the situation, special operations were defined that made it possible to cancel (from inside the ride) priority of longer neighbors or shorter links, and also to make the algorithm consider not only the rightmost node of the right fragment.",

        "1992).",
        "It contains over 10,000 entries, mainly general scientific vocabulary and terms from computer science and electrical engineering.",
        "The number of rules in the system is now about 100.",
        "Total number of arcs in their transition graphs is about 2,000.",
        "As a source of texts, we have taken several issues of the journal Computer Science Abstracts (Referativnyj zhurnal Vychisliier nyje Nauki, in Russian).",
        "Sentences are chosen at random.",
        "Sentences with formulas, occasional abbreviations, and non-Cyrillic words are excluded.",
        "Words absent in the dictionaries (about 8% of all word occurences in these texts) are replaced by \"dummy\" words that have syntactic properties most probable for the given category.",
        "At present, about 300 sentences have been processed.",
        "On the average, fragments produced by partial parsing include 3 - 4 words.",
        "It is not infrequent that they have 8 - 10 or more words, or present complete structures of sentences.",
        "On the other hand, a substantial part of fragments are isolated homonyms.",
        "For instance, subordinate conjunctions remain isolated in most cases because, as a rule, their links with other words are not considered having high probability.",
        "Frequently enough morphological, lexical, and structural ambiguity results in building 2 - 4 different fragments on the same segment.",
        "Sometimes their number is 8 - 12 and more, but such cases arc relatively rare.",
        "The record is now equal to 72 fragments on a segment of 9 words.",
        "For such cases, packing techniques can be developed similar to those described by 'fond ta (1987).",
        "Another possible method is to employ numerical estimates of syntactic preference (see, for example, Tsejtin 1975; Kulagina 1987, 1990; Tsujii et al.",
        "1988).",
        "On the average, the number of established links is 70 - 80 % of the total number of syntactic links in the sentence.",

        "(Here we do not take into account semantically abnormal sentences or the possibility of overlapping; these situations would require more accurate definitions.)",
        "In most cases, an error means that some link of a fragment is established erroneously, while all the others are correct.",
        "The experiments have shown that the frequency of errors for the algorithm described is fairly small.",
        "For the last 100 sentences, 12 errors were made (9 of the first type and 3 of the second), which is less than 1 % of the total number of links established in correct fragments.",
        "A stable estimate is not yet obtained because at this stage of experiments tuning of the rules is continued, and the error frequency decreases steadily.",
        "Errors of the first type are caused by inaccuracy of the lexicographic descriptions and imperfection of the rules.",
        "In the presence of adequate lexicographic information, these errors in principle are avoidable, as the rules may fully control internal properties of the fragments being created.",
        "The second type of error is intrinsic to our approach.",
        "The rules employed are local in two respects: they take no (or almost no) account of the context outside the fragments being adjoined, and they take no account of a very large part of syntax that concerns less probable links.",
        "The first restriction means that fragments may appear which arc grammatically feasible but do not agree with the context.",
        "The second one implies that we do not intend to obtain complete structures of sentences, and therefore shall not be able to reject a fragment for the reason that it is not engaged in any complete structure.",
        "In general, it is not at all surprising that a certain part of syntactic links can be reliably revealed by local mechanisms.",
        "Any flow of texts in any language must contain chains of words the parse of which weakly depends on the context (\"weakly\" can be understood here in the statistical sense: the share of those occurences for which the parse differs from the most probable one is small).",
        "The possibility of examining fragments in any detail permits to avoid situations in which the risk of creating a non-feasible fragment is too large.",
        "A more surprising fact is that the number of reliably established links is rather high - about 75 %.",
        "For the most part, these are links typical of the basic, most frequent syntactic constructions such as \"adjective +noun\", \"preposition + noun\", \"numeral + noun\", \"adverb + verb\", and also a large group of links connecting predicate words with their arguments.",
        "As regards the last type, preference for the predicate-argument interpretation of word combinations was often noted in the literature (this preference is a particular case of the Most Restrictive Context Principle proposed by Hobbs and Bear (1990)).",
        "Observations show that the number of established high-probability links noticeably depends on the type of text.",
        "The general trend is as follows: the more \"formal\" the text is, the more links are established.",
        "From this point of view, the language of scientific abstracts suits the given approach quite well.",
        "As regards comparative frequency of high-probability links in different languages, it would be natural to expect these links to be more typical of languages with rich morphology than of analytical ones (such as English).",
        "Nevertheless, preliminary experiments have shown no substantial difference in this respect between English and Russian scientific texts.",
        "We suppose that in case of high-probability links, the efficiency of local approach is additionally augmented due to factors \"of the second order\" concerning general mechanisms of text comprehension and generation.",
        "This opinion is based on the following assumptions.",
        "If someone reading a text sees that a high-probability link is possible between certain words and this link is compatible with the previous part of the text, then he makes a conjecture that this link is correct; such conjecture is abandoned only if some counter-evidence is obtained.",
        "When people generate texts, they take into account this property of the comprehension mechanism and tend not to disappoint expectations of the readers.",
        "In other words, they are careful not to create high-probability links that would prove to be incorrect.",
