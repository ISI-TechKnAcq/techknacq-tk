        "In the field of discourse research, it is now widely agreed that sentences/clauses are usually not understood in isolation, but in relation to other sentences/clauses.",
        "Given the high level of interest in explaining the nature of these relations and in providing definitions for them (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Martin, 1992; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Hovy and Maier, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998), it is surprising that there are no robust programs capable of identifying discourse relations that hold between arbitrary spans of text.",
        "Consider, for example, the sentence/clause pairs below.",
        "a.",
        "Such standards would preclude arms sales to (1) states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a U.N. embargo.",
        "b.",

        "a.",
        "South Africa can afford to forgo sales of guns (2) and grenades b. because it actually makes most of its profits",
        "from the sale of expensive, high-technology systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and battlefield mobility systems.",
        "In these examples, the discourse markers But and because help us figure out that a CONTRAST relation holds between the text spans in (1) and an EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relation holds between the spans in (2).",
        "Unfortunately, cue phrases do not signal all relations in a text.",
        "In the corpus of Rhetorical Structure trees (www.isi.edu/ – marcu/discourse/) built by Carlson et al.",
        "(2001), for example, we have observed that only 61 of 238 CONTRAST relations and 79 out of 307 EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relations that hold between two adjacent clauses were marked by a cue phrase.",
        "So what shall we do when no discourse markers are used?",
        "If we had access to robust semantic interpreters, we could, for example, infer from sentence 1.a that “can-notbuyarmslegally(libya)”, infer from sentence 1.b that “canbuyarmslegally(rwanda)”, use our background knowledge in order to infer that “similar(libya,rwanda)”, and apply Hobbs’s (1990) definitions of discourse relations to arrive at the conclusion that a CONTRAST relation holds between the sentences in (1).",
        "Unfortunately, the state of the art in NLP does not provide us access to semantic interpreters and general purpose knowledge bases that would support these kinds of inferences.",
        "The discourse relation definitions proposed by others (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998) are not easier to apply either because they assume the ability to automatically derive, in addition to the semantics of the text spans, the intentions and illocutions associated with them as well.",
        "In spite of the difficulty of determining the discourse relations that hold between arbitrary text spans, it is clear that such an ability is important in many applications.",
        "First, a discourse relation recognizer would enable the development of improved discourse parsers and, consequently, of high performance single document summarizers (Marcu, 2000).",
        "In multidocument summarization (DUC, 2002), it would enable the development of summarization programs capable of identifying contradictory statements both within and across documents and of producing summaries that reflect not only the similarities between various documents, but also their differences.",
        "In question-answering, it would enable the development of systems capable of answering sophisticated, non-factoid queries, such as “what were the causes ofX?” or “what contradicts Y?",
        "”, which are beyond the state of the art of current systems (TREC, 2001).",
        "In this paper, we describe experiments aimed at building robust discourse-relation classification systems.",
        "To build such systems, we train a family of Naive Bayes classifiers on a large set of examples that are generated automatically from two corpora: a corpus of 41,147,805 English sentences that have no annotations, and BLIPP, a corpus of 1,796,386 automatically parsed English sentences (Charniak, 2000), which is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (www.ldc.upenn.edu).",

        "In order to build a discourse relation classifier, one first needs to decide what relation definitions one is going to use.",
        "In Section 1, we simply relied on the reader’s intuition when we claimed that a CONTRAST relation holds between the sentences in (1).",
        "In reality though, associating a discourse relation with a text span pair is a choice that is clearly influenced by the theoretical framework one is willing to adopt.",
        "If we adopt, for example, Knott and Sanders’s (1998) account, we would say that the relation between sentences 1.a and 1.b is ADDITIVE, because no causal connection exists between the two sentences, PRAGMATIC, because the relation pertains to illocutionary force and not to the propositional content of the sentences, and NEGATIVE, because the relation involves a CONTRAST between the two sentences.",
        "In the same framework, the relation between clauses 2.a and 2.b will be labeled as CAUSAL-SEMANTIC-POSITIVE-NONBASIC.",
        "In Lascarides and Asher’s theory (1993), we would label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EXPLANATION because the event in 2.b explains why the event in 2.a happened (perhaps by CAUSING it).",
        "In Hobbs’s theory (1990), we would also label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EXPLANATION because the event asserted by 2.b CAUSED or could CAUSE the event asserted in 2.a.",
        "And in Mann and Thompson theory (1988), we would label sentence pairs 1.a, 1.b as CONTRAST because the situations presented in them are the same in many respects (the purchase of arms), because the situations are different in some respects (Libya cannot buy arms legally while Rwanda can), and because these situations are compared with respect to these differences.",
        "By a similar line of reasoning, we would label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EVIDENCE.",
        "The discussion above illustrates two points.",
        "First, it is clear that although current discourse theories are built on fundamentally different principles, they all share some common intuitions.",
        "Sure, some theories talk about “negative polarity” while others about “contrast”.",
        "Some theories refer to “causes”, some to “potential causes”, and some to “explanations”.",
        "But ultimately, all these theories acknowledge that there are such things as CONTRAST, CAUSE, and EXPLANATION relations.",
        "Second, given the complexity of the definitions these theories propose, it is clear why it is difficult to build programs that recognize such relations in unrestricted texts.",
        "Current NLP techniques do not enable us to reliably infer from sentence 1.a that “cannotbuyarmslegally(libya)” and do not give us access to general purpose knowledge bases that assert that “similar(libya,rwanda)”.",
        "The approach we advocate in this paper is in some respects less ambitious than current approaches to discourse relations because it relies upon a much smaller set of relations than those used by Mann and Thompson (1988) or Martin (1992).",
        "In our work, we decide to focus only on four types of relations, which we call: CONTRAST, CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE (CEV), CONDITION, and ELABORATION.",
        "(We define these relations in Section 2.2.)",
        "In other respects though, our approach is more ambitious because it focuses on the problem of recognizing such discourse relations in unrestricted texts.",
        "In other words, given as input sentence pairs such as those shown in (1)–(2), we develop techniques and programs that label the relations that hold between these sentence pairs as CONTRAST, CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE, CONDITION, ELABORATION or NONE-OF-THE-ABOVE, even when the discourse relations are not explicitly signalled by discourse markers."

        "We hypothesized that the flattening of the learning curve is explained by the noise in our training data and the vast amount of word pairs that are not likely to be good predictors of discourse relations.",
