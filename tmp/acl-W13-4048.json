        "Although Koller et al(2012) explored listener gaze in that context, it is known that gaze patterns differ in interactions, depending on whether one speaks or listens (Jokinen et al., 2009).",
        "Facelab provides a mapping between a person's gaze vector and the screen, which yields an intersection point in pixel coordinates.",

        "sible that the gaze vector does not intersect the model of the screen when the subject is looking at pieces near screen corners.",
        "For this reason, we first perform offline linear interpolation, artificially extending the screen by 200 pixels in each direction, by means of linear regression of the x, y components of the gaze vector with the x, y pixel coordinates, respectively (R2 > 0.95 in all cases).",
        "Figure 2 shows the probability density function of intersection points before (left) and after this process (right), for one of the subjects.",

        "To do this, we calculate the euclidean distance between each piece and the fixation centroid, and assign the piece a probability of being gazed at, which is inversely proportional to its distance from the centroid.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates the gazing behaviour of the subjects during 1051 episodes: After an initial rapid scan of the whole screen (typically before they start speaking), subjects fixate on the piece they are going to describe (the ?gold piece?).",
        "This is denoted by the rising number of fixations on the gold piece between seconds 5?10.",
        "At the same time, the average rank of the gold piece is higher (i.e. closer to 1, hence lower in the plot).",
        "Subsequently, the average rank drops as subjects tend to casually look around the screen for possible dis-tractors (i.e. pieces that are identical or similar to the gold piece).",
