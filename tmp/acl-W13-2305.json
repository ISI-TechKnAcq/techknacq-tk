        "Human annotations of language are often required in natural language processing (NLP) tasks for evaluation purposes, in order to estimate how well a given system mimics activities traditionally performed by humans.",
        "In tasks such as machine translation (MT) and natural language generation, the system output is a fully-formed string in a target language.",
        "Annotations can take the form of direct estimates of the quality of those outputs or be structured as the simpler task of ranking competing outputs from best-to-worst (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "A direct estimation method of assessment, as opposed to ranking outputs from best-to-worst, has the advantage that it includes in annotations not only that one output is better than another, but also the degree to which that output was better than the other.",
        "In addition, direct estimation of quality within the context of machine translation extends the usefulness of the annotated data to other tasks such as quality-estimation (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "For an evaluation to be credible, the annotations must be credible.",
        "The simplest way of establishing this is to have the same data point annotated by multiple annotators, and measure the agreement between them.",
        "There has been a worrying trend in recent MT shared tasks ?",
        "whether the evaluation was structured as ranking translations from best-to-worst, or by direct estimation of fluency and adequacy ?",
        "of agreement between annotators decreasing (Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "Inconsistency in human evaluation of machine translation calls into question conclusions drawn from those assessments, and is the target of this paper: by revising the annotation process, can we improve annotator agreement, and hence the quality of human annotations?",
        "Direct estimates of quality are intrinsically continuous in nature, but are often collected using an interval-level scale with a relatively low number of categories, perhaps to make the task cognitively easier for human assessors.",
        "In MT evaluation, five and seven-point interval-level scales are common (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).",
        "However, the interval-level scale commonly used for direct estimation of translation quality (and other NLP annotation tasks) forces human judges to discretize their assessments into a fixed number of categories, and this process could be a cause of inconsistency in human judgments.",
        "In particular, an assessor may be repeatedly forced to choose between two categories, neither of which really fits their judgment.",
        "The continuous nature of translation quality assessment, as well as the fact that many statistical methods exist that can be applied to continuous data but not interval-level data, motivates our trial of a continuous rating scale.",
        "We use human judgments of translation fluency as a test case and compare consistency levels when",
        "the conventional 5-point interval-level scale and a continuous visual analog scale (VAS) are used for human evaluation.",
        "We collected data via Amazon's Mechanical Turk, where the quality of annotations is known to vary considerably (Callison-Burch et al., 2010).",
        "As such, we test two quality-control techniques based on statistical significance ?",
        "made possible by the use of the continuous rating scale ?",
        "to intrinsically assess the quality of individual human judges.",

        "Measurement of fluency as a component of MT evaluation has been carried out for a number of years (LDC, 2005), but it has proven difficult to acquire consistent judgments, even from expert assessors.",
        "Evaluation rounds such as the annual Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) use human judgments of translation quality to produce official rankings in shared tasks, initially using an two-item assessment of fluency and adequacy as separate attributes, and more recently by asking judges to simply rank system outputs against one another according to ?which translation is better?.",
        "However, the latter method also reports low levels of agreement between judges.",
        "For example, the 2007 WMT reported low levels of consistency in fluency judgments in terms of both intra-annotator agreement (intra-aa), with a kappa coefficient of ?",
        "= 0.54 (moderate), and inter-annotator agreement (inter-aa), with ?",
        "= 0.25 (slight).",

        "= 0.47 for intra-aa, and ?",
        "= 0.23 for inter-aa.",
        "While concerns over annotator agreement have seen recent WMT evaluations move away from using fluency as an evaluation component, there can be no question that fluency is a useful means of evaluating translation output.",
        "In particular, it is not biased by reference translations.",
        "The use of automatic metrics is often criticized by the fact that a system that produces a good translation which happens not to be similar to the reference translations will be unfairly penalized.",
        "Similarly, if human annotators are provided with one or more reference sentences, they may inadvertently favor translations that are similar to those references.",
        "If fluency is judged independently of adequacy, no reference translation is needed, and the bias is removed.",
        "In earlier work, we consider the possibility that translation quality is a hypothetical construct (Graham et al., 2012), and suggest applying methods of validating measurement of psychological constructs to the validation of measurements of translation quality.",
        "In psychology, a scale that employs more items as opposed to fewer is considered more valid.",

        "Several guides exist for instructing researchers from various backgrounds on using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) (Gibson et al., 2011; Callison-Burch, 2009), and allowance for the use of AMT is increasingly being made in research grant applications, as a cost-effective way of gathering data.",
        "Issues remain in connection with low payment levels (Fort et al., 2011); nevertheless, Ethics Approval Boards are typically disinterested in projects that make use of AMT, regarding AMT as being a purchased service rather than a part of the experimentation that may affect human subjects.",

        "sponse rates for languages other than to-English were problematic, and we also received a number of apparently-genuine requests from native speakers residing outside the target countries.",

        "On the other hand, crowd-sourced judgments also offer the potential of being more valid than those of experts, since person-in-the-street abilities might be a more useful yardstick for some tasks than informed academic judgment, and because a greater number of judges may be available.",
