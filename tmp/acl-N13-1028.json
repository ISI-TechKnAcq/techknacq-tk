        "The development of objective metrics to assess the distances between different languages is of great theoretical and practical importance.",
        "Currently, subjective measures have generally been employed to assess the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between different languages (Gooskens & Heeringa, 2004; Van-Bezooijen & Heeringa, 2006; Van-Hout & M?nstermann, 1981), and those subjective decisions are, for example, the basis for classifying separate languages, and certain groups of language variants as dialects of one another.",
        "It is well known that languages are complex; they differ in vocabulary, grammar, writing format, syntax and many other characteristics.",
        "This presents levels of difficulty in the construction of objective comparative measures between languages.",
        "Even if one intuitively knows, for example, that English is closer to French than it is to Chinese, what are the objective factors that allow one to assess the levels of distance?",
        "This bears substantial similarities to the analogous questions that have been asked about the relationships between different species in the science of cladistics.",
        "As in cladistics, the most satisfactory answer would be a direct measure of the amount of time that has elapsed since the languages?",
        "first split from their most recent common ancestor.",
        "Also, as in cladistics, it is hard to measure this from the available evidence, and various approximate measures have to be employed instead.",
        "In the biological case, recent decades have seen tremendous improvements in the accuracy of biological measurements as it has become possible to measure differences between DNA sequences.",
        "In linguistics, the analogue of DNA measurements is historical information on the evolution of languages, and the more easily measured?though indirect measurements (akin to the biological phenotype)?are either the textual or acoustic representations of the languages in question.",
        "In the current article, we focus on language distance measures derived from both text and acoustic formats; we apply two different techniques, namely Levenshtein distance between orthographic word transcriptions, and distances between language pitch means in order to obtain measures of dissimilarity amongst a set of languages.",
        "These methods are used to obtain language groupings which are represented graphically using multidimensional scaling and dendrograms?two standard statistical techniques.",
        "This allows us to visualize and assess the methods relative to known linguistic facts in order to judge their relative reliability(Zulu, Botha, & Barnard, 2008).",
        "Our evaluation is based on six of the eleven official languages of South Africa.",
        "The eleven official languages fall into two distinct groups, namely the Germanic group (represented by English and Afrikaans) and the South African Bantu languages, which belong to the South Eastern Bantu group.",
        "The South African Bantu languages can further be classified in terms of different sub-groupings: Nguni (consisting of Zulu, Xhosa, Ndebele and Swati), Sotho (consisting of Southern So-tho, Northern Sotho and Tswana), and a pair that falls outside these subfamilies (Tsonga and Ven-da).",
        "The six languages chosen for our evaluation are English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Northern So-tho (also known as Sepedi) and Tswana, which equally represent the three groups; Germanic, Nguni and Sotho.",
        "We believe that an understanding of these language distances is not only of inherent interest, but also of great practical importance.",
        "For purposes such as language learning, the selection of target languages for various resources and the development of Human Language Technologies, reliable knowledge of language distances would be of great value.",
        "Consider, for example, the common situation of an organization that wishes to publish information relevant to all languages in a particular multilingual community, but has insufficient funding to do so.",
        "Such an organization can be guided by knowledge of language distances and mutual intelligibility between languages to make an appropriate choice of publication languages.",
        "The following sections describe the Levenshtein distance and pitch characteristics in detail.",

        "Data for all eleven languages is available on the Lwazi website: (http://www.meraka.org.za/lwazi/index.php).",

        "which is generally required in order to produce good results.",

        "Finally, it would be valuable to compare various distance measures against other criteria for language similarity (e.g. historical separation or mutual intelligibility) in a rigorous fashion."
