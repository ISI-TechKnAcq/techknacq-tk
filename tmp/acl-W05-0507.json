        "Chomsky (1957, 1980) has argued that the child’s acquisition of grammar is ‘hopelessly underdeter-mined by the fragmentary evidence available.’ He attributed this indeterminacy to two major sources.",
        "The first is the degenerate nature of the input.",
        "According to Chomsky, the sentences heard by the child are so full of retracing, error, and incompletion that they provide no clear indication of the possible sentences of the language.",
        "Coupled with this problem of input degeneracy is the problem of unavailability of negative evidence.",
        "According to this view, children have a hard time knowing which forms of their language are acceptable and which are unacceptable, because parents fail to provide consistent evidence regarding the ungrammaticality of unacceptable sentences.",
        "Worse still, when such evidence is provided, children a p-pear to ignore it.",
        "Chomsky’s (1957) views about the degeneracy of the input did not stand up well to the test of time.",
        "As Newport, Gleitman & Gleitman (1977) reported, ‘the speech of mothers to children is unswervingly well-formed.’ More recently, Sagae, Lavie & MacWhinney (2004) examined several of the corpora in the CHILDES database and found that adult input to children can be parsed with an accuracy level parallel to that for corpora such as the Wall Street Journal database.",
        "This evidence for well formedness of the input did not lead to the collapse of the ‘argument from poverty of stimulus’ (APS).",
        "Ho wever, it did place increased weight on the remaining claims regarding the absence of relevant evidence.",
        "The overall claim is that, given the absence of appropriate positive and negative evidence, no child can acquire language without guidance from a rich set of species-specific innate hypotheses.",
        "Some refer to the argument from poverty of stimulus as the ‘logical problem of language acquisition (Baker, 1979), while others have called it ‘Plato’s Problem,’ ‘Chomsky’s Problem,’ ‘Gold’s Problem,’ or ‘Baker’s Paradox.’"

        "In the 1970s, generativist analyses of learnability (Wexler & Hamburger, 1973) relied primarily on an analysis presented by Gold (1967).",
        "Gold’s analysis contrasted two different language-learning situations: text presentation and informant presentation.",
        "With informant presentation, the language learner can receive feedback from an infallible informant regarding the grammaticality of every candidate sentence.",
        "This corrective feedback is called ‘negative evidence’ and it only requires that",
        "ungrammatical strings be clearly identified as u n-acceptable.",
        "Whenever the learner formulates an overly general guess about some particular linguistic structure, the informant will label the resulting structure as ungrammatical and the learner will use this information to restrict the developing grammar.",
        "Based on initial empirical results reported by Brown & Hanlon (1970), Gold argued that negative evidence is not available to the child and that language learning cannot be based on informant presentation.",
        "Marcus (1993) has argued that the feedback that parents provide does not discriminate consistently between grammatical and ungrammatical constructions.",
        "As a result, children cannot rely on simple, overt negative evidence for recovery from over-generalization.",
        "Although I will argue that parents provide positive evidence in a form that solves the logical problem (Bohannon et al., 1990), I agree with the observation that this evidence does not constitute overt grammatical correction of the type envisioned by Gold."

      "text": [
        "Beginning about 1980, generative analyses of learnability began to shift away from an emphasis on the unavailability of negative evidence to arg u-ments based on the unavailability of positive evidence.",
        "This conceptual shift led to a relative decline in attention to recovery from overgenerali-zation and an increase in attention to reported cases of error free learning.",
        "For example, Chomsky’s (1980) statement of the logical problem relies on the notion of error-free learning without positive evidence.",
        "The argumentation here is that, if a structure is never encountered in the input, correct use of this structure would have to indicate innate knowledge.",
        "Researchers have claimed that the child produces error-free learning without receiving positive evidence for structures such as: structural dependency, c-command, the binding conditions, subjacency, negative polarity items, that-trace deletion, nominal compound formation, control, auxiliary phrase ordering, and the empty category principle.",
        "In each of these cases, it is necessary to assume that the underlying universal is a part of the non-parameterized core of universal grammar.",
        "If the dimension involved were parameterized, there would be a need for some form of very early parameter setting (Wexler, 1998), which could itself introduce some error.",
        "Thus, we would expect error-free learning to occur primarily for those aspects of the grammar that are completely universal and not parameterized.",
        "Parameterized features, such as subject pro-drop, could still be guided by universal grammar.",
        "However, their learning would not necessarily be error -free."

        "The paradigm case of error-free learning is the child’s obedience to the Structural Dependency condition, as outlined by Chomsky in his formal discussion with Jean Piaget (Piattelli-Palmarini, 1980).",
        "Chomsky notes that children learn early on to move the auxiliary to initial position in questions, such as ‘Is the man coming?’ One formulation of this rule is that it stipulates the movement of the first auxiliary to initial position.",
        "This formulation would be based on surface order, rather than structural relations.",
        "However, if children want to question the proposition given in (1), they will never produce a movement such as (2).",
        "Instead, they will always produce (3).",
        "1.",
        "The man who is running is coming.",
        "2.",
        "Is the man who __ running is coming?",
        "3.",
        "Is the man who is running __ coming?’",
        "In order to produce (3), children must be basing the movement on structure, rather than surface order.",
        "Thus, according to Chomsky, they must be innately guided to formulate rules in terms of structure.",
        "In the theory of barriers (Chomsky, 1986), the repositioning of the auxiliary in the tree and then in surface structure involves a movement of INFL to COMP that is subject to the head movement constraint.",
        "In (2) the auxiliary would need to move around the N’ of ‘man’ and the CP and COMP of the relative clause, but this movement would be blocked by the head movement constraint (HMC).",
        "No such barriers exist in the main clause.",
        "In addition, if the auxiliary moves as in (2), it leaves a gap that will violate the empty category principle (ECP).",
        "Chomsky’s discussion with Piaget does not rely on these details.",
        "Chomsky simply argues that the child has to realize that phrasal structure is somehow involved in this process and that one cannot formulate the rule of auxiliary movement as ‘move the first auxiliary to the front.’",
        "Chomsky claims that, ‘A person might go through much or all of his life without ever having been exposed to relevant evidence, but he will nevertheless unerringly employ the structure-dependent generalization, on the first relevant occasion.’ A more general statement of this type provided by Hornstein & Lightfoot (1981) who claim that, ‘People attain knowledge of the structure of their language for which no evidence is available in the data to which they are exposed as children.’ In order to evaluate these claims empirically, we need to know when children first produce such sentences and whether they have been exposed to relevant examples in the input prior to this time.",
        "In searching for instances of relevant input as well as first uses, we should include two types of sentences.",
        "First, we want to include sentences such as (3) in which the moved verb was a copula in the relative clause, as well as sentences with auxiliaries in both positions, such as ‘Will the boy who is wearing a Yankee’s cap step forward?’ The auxiliaries do not have to be lexically identical, since Chomsky’s argument from poverty of stimulus would also apply to a child who was learning the movement rule on the basis of lexical class, as opposed to surface lexical form.",
        "Examining the TreeBank structures for the Wall Street Journal in the Penn TreeBank, Pullum & Scholz (Pullum & Scholz, 2002) estimate that adult corpora contain up to 1% of such sentences.",
        "However, the presence of such structures in formal written English says little about their presence in the input to the language-learning child.",
        "A search by Lewis & Elman (2001) of the input to English-speaking children in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000) turned up only one case of this structure out of approximately 3 million utterances.",
        "Since CHILDES includes good sampling of target children up to age 5;0, we can safely say that positive evidence for this particular structure is seldom encountered in the language addressed to children younger than 5;0.",
        "Because children do not produce sentences of this type themselves, it is difficult to use production data to demonstrate the presence of the constraint.",
        "Crain & Nakayama (1987) attempted to get around this problem by eliciting these forms from children directly.",
        "They asked children (3;2 to 5;11) to, ‘Ask Jabba if the boy who is watching Mickey is happy.’ Children responded with a variety of structures, none of which involved the movement of the auxiliary from the relative clause.",
        "Unfortunately, this elicitation procedure encourages children to treat the relative clause (‘the boy who is watching Mickey’) as an imitated chunk.",
        "Despite the serious methodological limitation in this particular study, it seems reasonable to believe that four-year-old children are beginning to behave in accordance with the Structural Dependency condition for sentences like (2) and (3).",
        "But does this mean that they reach this point without learning?",
        "There is another type of sentence that provides equally useful positive evidence regarding auxiliary movement.",
        "These are wh-questions with embedded relative clauses.",
        "It turns out that there are hundreds of input sentences of this type in the CHILDES corpus.",
        "Most of these have the form of (4), but some take the form of (5).",
        "4.",
        "Where is the dog that you like?",
        "5.",
        "Which is the dog that is clawing at the door?",
        "In (5) the child receives clear information demonstrating that moved auxiliaries derive from the main clause and not the relative clause.",
        "Using evidence of the type provided in (4), the child simply learns that moved auxiliaries and the wh-words that accompany them are arguments of the verb of the main clause.",
        "Sentences like (4) and (5) are highly frequent in the input to children and both types instruct the child in the same correct generalization.",
        "Based on evidence from the main clause, the child could formulate the rule as a placement after the wh-word of the auxiliary that is conceptually related to the verb being questioned.",
        "In other words, it is an attachment to the wh-word of an argument of the main verb.",
        "This is a complex application of the process of item-based construction generation proposed in MacWhinney (1975, 1982).",
        "This formulation does not rely on barriers, ECP, HCP, INFL, COMP, or movement.",
        "It does rely on the notion of argument structure, but only as it emerges from the application of item-based constructions.",
        "Given this formulation, a few simple yes–no questions would be enough to demonstrate the pattern.",
        "When children hear ‘is the baby happy’ they can learn that the initial copula auxiliary ‘is’ takes a subject argument in the next slot and a predicate argument in the following slot.",
        "They will learn similar frames for each of the other fronted auxiliaries.",
        "When they then encounter sentences such as (11) and (12), they will further elaborate the item-based auxiliary frames to allow for positioning of the initial wh-words and for attachment of the auxiliaries to these wh -words.",
        "One might argue that this learning scenario amounts to a restatement of Chomsky’s claim, since it requires the child to pay attention to relational patterns, rather than serial order as calculated from the beginning of the sentence.",
        "However, if the substance of Chomsky’s claim is that children learn to fill argument slots with compound constituents, then his analysis seems indistinguishable from that of MacWhinney (1975; 1987a)."

        "Neural network models that rely on back-propagation assume that negative evidence is continually available for every learning trial.",
        "For this type of model to make sense, the child would have to depend heavily on both expressive and receptive monitoring.",
        "It is unlikely that these two mechanisms operate as continuously as would be required for a mechanism such as back-propagation.",
        "However, not all connectionist models rely on the availability of negative evidence.",
        "For example, Kohonen’s self-organizing feature map model",

        "The seventh solution to the logical problem of language acquisition relies on the computation of indirect negative evidence.",
        "This computation can be illustrated with the error ‘*goed.’ To construct indirect negative evidence in this case, children need to track the frequency of all verbs and the frequency of the past tense as marked by the regular ‘-ed.’ Then they need to compute regular ‘-ed’ as a percentage of all verbs.",
        "Next they need to track the frequency of the verb ‘go’ in all of its uses and the frequency of ‘*goed”.",
        "To gain a bit more certainty, they should also calculate the frequency of a verb like ‘jump’ and the frequency of ‘jumped.’ With these ratios in hand, the child can then compare the ratio for ‘go’ with those for ‘jump’ or verbs in general and conclude that the attested cases of ‘*goed’ are fewer than would be expected on the basis of evidence from verbs like ‘jump.’ They can then conclude that ‘*goed’ is ungrammatical.",
        "Interestingly, they can do this without receiving overt correction.",
        "The structures for which indirect negative evidence could provide the most useful accounts are ones that are learned rather late.",
        "These typically involve low-error constructions of the type that motivate the strong form of the logical problem.",
        "For example, children could compute indirect negative evidence that would block wh-raising from object-modifying relatives in sentences such as (37).",
        "36.",
        "The police arrested the thieves who were carrying the loot.",
        "37.",
        "*What did the police arrest the thieves w ho were carrying?",
        "38.",
        "To do this, they would need to track the frequency of sentences such as: 39.",
        "Bill thought the thieves were carrying the loot.",
        "40.",
        "What did Bill think the thieves were carrying?",
        "Noting that raising from predicate complements occurs fairly frequently, children could reasonably conclude that the absence of raising from object modification position means that it is ungrammatical.",
        "Coupled with conserv atism, indirect negative evidence can be a useful mechanism for avoiding overgeneralization of complex syntactic structures.",
        "The item-based acquisition component of the Competition Model provides a framework for computing indirect negative evidence.",
        "The indirect negative evidence tracker could note that, although ‘squeeze’ occurs frequently in the input, ‘*unsqueeze’ does not.",
        "This mechanism works through the juxtaposition of a form receiving episodic support (‘squeeze’) with a predicted inflected form (‘unsqueeze’).",
        "This mechanism uses analogic pressure to predict the form ‘*unsqueeze.’ This is the same mechanism as used in the generation of ‘*goed.’ However, the child does not need to actually produce ‘*unsqueeze,’ only to hypothesize its existence.",
        "This form is then tracked in the input.",
        "If it is not found, the comparison of the near-zero strength of the unconfirmed form ‘unsqueeze’ with the confirmed form ‘squeeze’ leads to the strengthening of competitors such as ‘release’ and blocking of any attempts to use ‘unsqueeze.’ Although this mechanism is plausible, it is more complicated than the basic competition mechanism and places a greater requirement on memory for tracking of non-occurrences.",
        "Since the end result of this tracking of indirect negative evidence is the same as that of the basic competition mechanism, it is reasonable to imagine that learners use this mechanism only as a fall back strategy, relying on simple competition to solve most problems requiring recovery from overgeneralization."

        "This analysis suggests that we should not longer speak of language learning as being confined by the poverty of positive evidence or negative evidence.",
        "Both types of evidence are far more abundant than has been imagined.",
        "Nor should we assume that recovery from overgeneralization involves a fundamental logical problem.",
        "Recovery is supported by a set of four powerful processes (competition, cue construction, monitoring, and indirect negative evidence) that provide redundant and complementary solutions to the logical problem.",
        "In addition, we know that alternative characterizations of the nature of the target grammar can",
        "take much of the logical bit out of the logical problem.",
        "Finally, we have seen that the language addressed to children is not at all unparsable or degenerate, once a few superficial retracing structures are repaired.",
        "We have reviewed seven solutions to the logical problem that work together to buffer the process of language acquisition.",
        "When we consider the interaction of the seven solutions in this way, we soon come to realize the pivotal role played by the item-based construction.",
        "First, the item-based construction directly enforces conservatism by requiring that each generalization of each argument frame be based on directly observable positive evidence.",
        "Second, the probabilistic competition between item-based constructions provides a meaningful way of understanding the probabilistic nature of grammar.",
        "Third, the competition between item-based constructions directly promotes recovery from overgeneralization.",
        "Fourth, the additional mechanisms of cue construction, indirect negative evidence, and monitoring serve to fine-tune the operations of competition.",
        "These processes operate particularly in those cases where uniqueness is not fully transparent or where the restriction of a general process requires additional fine-tuning of cues.",
        "The current analysis assigns great importance to good positive data.",
        "Marcus (1993) has suggested that parents are inconsistent in their provision of negative evidence to the child.",
        "But the Competition Model assumes that it is positive data that is crucial for learning.",
        "One way in which a parent can provide crucial positive evidence is through recasting, but other methods are possible too.",
        "In various cultures and subgroups, positive evidence can be presented and focused through elicited repetition, choral recitation of stories, interaction with siblings, or games.",
        "Methods that emphasize shared attention and shared understanding can guide children toward the control of literate expression.",
        "This shared attention can arise in groups of co-wives in Central Africa just as easily as it can from isolated mother–child dyads in New England.",
        "Recently, Hauser, Chomsky, & Fitch (2002) have argued that the core evolutionary adaptation that was required to support human language involved the introduction of a facility for recursion.",
        "The analysis in the current paper modifies and extends this claim by emphasizing the evolutionary (MacWhinney, 2005) and developmental (Tomasello, 2000) centrality of the item-based construction as the controller of recursive composition of phrases and sentences.",
        "However MacWhinney (2005) views linguistic recursion as emerging gradually from preexisting structures in spatial cognition, rather than as appearing suddenly during the Late Pleistocene.",
        "Studies of the functional neural underpinnings of recursion can go a long ways toward clarifying the details of these issues."
