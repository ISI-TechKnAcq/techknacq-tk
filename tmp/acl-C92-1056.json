        "The problem of word-sense disambiguation is central to text processing.",
        "Recently, promising computational methods have been suggested [Lesk, 1986; McDonald et al., 1990; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990; 7,ernik and Jacobs, 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Hearst, 1991] which attempt to use the local context of the word to be disambiguated together with information about each of its word senses to solve this problem.",
        "Lesk [1986] described a technique which measured the amount of overlap between a dictionary sense definition and the definitions of the words in the local context of the word to be disambiguated.",
        "He illustrated his method by successfully disambiguating the word \"cone\" in the phrases \"pine cone\" and \"ice cream cone\".",
        "Later researchers have extended this basic idea in various ways.",
        "Wilks et al., [1990] identified neighborhoods of the 2,187 control vocabulary words in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) [Procter, 1978] based on the co-occurrence of words in LDOCE dictionary definitions.",
        "These neighborhoods were then used to expand the word sense definitions of the word to be disambiguated, and the overlap between the expanded definitions and the local context was used to select the correct sense of a word.",
        "A similar method reported by Guthrie et al., [1991] who defined subject specific neighborhoods of words, using the subject area markings in the machine readable version of LDOCE.",
        "Hearst [1991] suggests using syntactic information and part-of-speech tagging to aid in the disambiguation.",
        "She gathers co-occurrence information Acres DE COLING-92, NANrras, 23-28 AO&F 1992 3 5 9 Mum.",
        "OE COLING-92, NAMES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 from manually sense-tagged text.",
        "Zernik and Jacobs [1990] also derive their neighborhoods from a training text which has been sense-tagged by hand.",
        "Their method incorporates other clues as to the sense of the word in question found in the morphology or by first tagging the text as to part of speech.",
        "Although each of these techniques look somewhat promising for disambiguation, the techniques have only been applied to several words, and the results have been based on experiments which repeatedly disambiguate a single word (or in [Zernik and Jacobs, 1990], one of three words) in a large number of sentences.",
        "In the cases where a success rate for the technique is reported, the results vary from 35% to 80%, depending on whether the correct sense is desired, or some coarser grained distinction is considered acceptable.",
        "Since only one sense is computed at a time, the question arises as to whether and how to incorporate the fact that a sense has been chosen for a word when attempting to disambiguate the next.",
        "Should this first choice be changed in light of how other word senses are selected?",
        "Although these problems were pointed out in Lesk's original paper, they have not yet been addressed.",
        "A method of word sense disambiguation which is designed to operate on a large scale and simultaneously for several words was suggested by Veronis and Ide [1990].",
        "The basis of this method is the construction of large neural networks which have words and word senses (chosen from the machine readable version of the Collins Dictionary) as nodes.",
        "Links are established from a word to each of its senses, and from each sense to every word in its definition.",
        "Inhibiting links are constructed between senses of the same word.",
        "In order to disambiguate a sentence, the words in the sentence are activated in the network, and this activation is allowed to spread with feedback.",
        "This cycle is repeated a preselected number of times, e.g., 100.",
        "At the end of this process, each word in the sentence is disambiguated by choosing its sense which is most highly activated.",
        "The authors report encouraging results on word pairs such as \"page\" and \"pen\" and \"pen\" and \"goat\".",
        "The only complete sentence reported on was \"The young page put the goat in the pen\" in which \"page\" and \"pen\" might be expected to work together to cause the wrong sense of each to be chosen.",
        "The inclusion of the word \"young\" overcomes this problem, and both \"page\" and \"pen\" are correctly disambiguated.",
        "The authors report that problems are presented by such factors as maintaining a balance between the activation of a word and its senses and the fact that a word with many senses tends to have more connections than one with fewer senses.",
        "They indicate that matters such as setting thresholds and rates of decay also present some difficulties.",
        "In contrast to the somewhat numerical techniques described above, more principled methods based on linguistic information such as selection restrictions or semantic preferences [Wilks, 1975a; 1975b; Wilks and Fass, 1991] have also been used for lexical disambiguation.",
        "These methods require extensive hand crafting by specialists of lexical items: assigning semantic categories to nouns, preferences to verbs and adjectives, etc..",
        "Maintaining consistency in these categories and preferences is a problem, and these methods are also susceptible to the combinatorial explosion described above.",
        "In this paper we suggest the application of a computational method called simulated annealing to this general class of methods (including some of the numerical methods referenced above) to allow all senses to be determined at once in a computationally effective way.",
        "We describe the application of simulated annealing to a basic method similar to that of Lesk [1986] which also uses the subject area markings in LDOCE, but which doesn't make use of other features such as part of speech tagging.",
        "The simplicity of the technique makes it fully automatic, and it requires no hand-tagging Acres DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 3 6 0 PRoc.",
        "OF COLING-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 of text or hand-crafting of neighborhoods.",
        "When this basic method operates under the guidance of the simulated annealing algorithm, sense selections are made concurrently for all ambiguous words in the sentence in a way designed to optimize their choice.",
        "The system's performance on a set of test sentences was encouraging and can be expected to improve when some of the refinements mentioned above are incorporated."

        "In our first experiment, the algorithm described above was used to disambiguate 50 example sentences from LDOCE.",
        "A stop list of very common words such as \"the\", \"as\", and \"of\" was removed from each sentence.",
        "The sentences then contained from two to fifteen words, with an average of 5.5 ambiguous words per sentence.",
        "Definitions in LDOCE are broken down first into broad senses which we call \"homographs\", and then into individual senses which distinguish among the various meanings.",
        "For example, one homograph of \"bank\" means roughly \"something piled up.\" There are five senses in this homograph which distinguish whether the thing piled up is snow, clouds, earth by a river, etc.",
        "Results of the algorithm were evaluated by having a literate human disambiguate the sentences and comparing these choices of word senses with the output of the program.",
        "Using the human choices as the standard, the algorithm correctly disambiguated 47% of the words to the sense level, and 72 % to the homograph level.",

        "It appears that in some cases the fact that our success rates include not only highly ambiguous words, but some words with only a few senses is offset by the fact that other researchers have used a broader definition of word sense.",
        "For example, the four senses of \"interest\" used by Zernik and Jacobs [1990] may correspond more closely to our two homographs and not our ten senses of \"interest.\" Their success rate in tagging the three words \"interest\", \"stock\", and \"bond\" was 70%.",
