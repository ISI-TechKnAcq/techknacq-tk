        "Minor variations exist between languages and dialects (for example the use of the period as decimal delimiter), and rule variations exist that guide its collocation with abbreviations.",

        "From this ternary distinction, two binary tasks can be derived, viz. the detection of abbreviations (MAM and EAM), and the detection of sentence endings (NSD and EAM).",

        "Figure 1 shows the pattern used to identify periods of interest for this study.",

        "2.2 Context evaluation The right context is evaluated first (Algorithm 1).",
        "It is based on the following assumptions: (i) Whenever a period terminates a sentence, the first character in the following token is capitalized.",
        "For a subset of words this can be ascertained by looking up the closed word class dictionary CCDict (the restriction to ?closed classes?",
        "is due to the fact that German nouns are mandatorily capitalized, including nominalized adjectives and verbs); (ii) A sentence can never be split by a line break, therefore a period that precedes the break necessarily marks the end of the previous sentence; (iii) Most punctuation signs that follow a period strongly indicate that the period character here plays the role of an abbreviation marker and does not coincide with an end-of-sentence marker.",

        "even when word is an abbreviation.",
        "These cases, for which the weighted log?",
        "is nega-tive, could then nevertheless be pushed to the positive side in the result of a strong S 4 .",
        "For the final decision in favor of an abbrevi-ation, we required that the following two conditions hold: (i) (S 1 ?",

        "S 3 ?",
        "S 4 )(log?)",

        "3 Results For the evaluation methodology, a gold standard was created by a random selection of 500 text frames, centered around a period with its left and right context (each 60 characters) from the evaluation set.",
        "The two authors rated each period in the center of the snippet as being an NSD, a MAM or an EAM.",
        "A subset of 100 was rated by both authors in order to compute the inter-rater agreement.",
        "We obtained a Cohen's kappa (Di Euge-nio and Glass, 2004, Hripcsak and Heitjan, 2002) of 0.98, when rating both abbreviation vs. non-abbreviation, and sentence delimiter vs. non sentence delimiter, respectively.",
        "Accuracy, true and false negative rates (Manning et al., 2008), are computed for the two processing steps in isolation.",
        "This required making some default assumptions for the cases in which the result was ambiguous.",
        "The assumptions are based on frequency distributions of the three values in the learning set.",
        "The left context processing detects abbreviations, but is unable to distinguish between EAM and MAM.",
        "As the frequency of MAM is much higher, this value is set wherever NSD is discarded.",
        "In the processing of the right context, the algorithm may fail to disambiguate between NSD vs. EAM, or even terminate with any decision (NSD vs. EAM vs. MAM), cf. Algorithm 1.",
        "In the latter case MAM is set, as this was determined to be the most frequent phenomenon in the learning data (0.53).",
        "In 98 the former case, NSD is given preference over EAM, which has a low frequency in the learning set (0.03).",
        "Table 1 shows accuracy and false positive / negative rates obtained by left, right and combined context evaluations.",

        "It is remarkable that the combination of both algorithms only produces a moderate gain in accuracy.",
        "For the minimization of certain false negatives and false positives, it can be advantageous to consider the right or left context separately.",
        "For in-stance, the right context algorithm alone is better at minimizing false positive sentence recognitions, whereas the left context algorithm is better suited at minimizing cases of false positive abbreviation detections.",
        "Apart from known issues such as the above mentioned parsing problems, for which the reader needs to be familiar with the domain and the style of the documents, the analysis of mis-classifications revealed several weaknesses: sensitivity to spelling and punctuation errors (espe- cially missing spaces after periods) and abbreviations that can also be read as a normal word (e.g.",
        "?Mal.?",
        "for ?Malignit?at?",
        "or ?Mal?",

        "5 Conclusion and Outlook We have presented and evaluated a method for disambiguating the period character in German-language medical narratives.",
        "It is a combination of a simple rule set and a statistical approach supported by lexicons.",
        "Whereas the crafting of the rule base considers peculiarities of the document language, primarily by exploiting language-specific capitalization rules, the processing of the external language resources and the statistical methodology are unsupervised.",
        "Given these pa-rameters, the accuracy values of about 93% for both abbreviation detection and sentence delineation are satisfactory, especially when one considers that the texts are error laden and highly compact, which also resulted in large numbers of ad-hoc abbreviations.",
        "We expect that with a limited training effort this rate can still be raised further.",
        "We are aware that the described period disambiguation procedure should be embedded into an NLP processing pipeline, where it must be preceded by a cleansing process that identifies ?hid- den?",
        "periods and restores the adherence to basic punctuation rules by inserting white spaces where necessary.",
        "An improved result can facilitate the creation of a sufficiently large, manually annotated corpus, which could then be used as the basis for the application of machine learning methods.",
        "Fur-thermore, the impact of the different modifications regarding the left context approach must be evaluated in more detail.",
