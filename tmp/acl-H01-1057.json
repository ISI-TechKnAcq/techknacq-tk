        "Many researchers have been trying to develop and implement in order to gain higher accuracy.",
        "Unlike in English, word segmentation in Thai, as well as in many other Asian languages, is more complex because the language does not have any explicit word boundary delimiters, such as a space, to separate between each word.",
        "It is even more complicated to precisely segment and identify the word boundary in Thai language because there are several levels and several roles in Thai characters that may lead to ambiguity in segmenting the words.",
        "In the past, most researchers had implemented Thai word segmentation systems based on using a dictionary ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7]).",
        "When using a dictionary, word segmentation has to cope with an unknown word problem.",
        "Up to present, it is clear that most researches on Thai word segmentation with a dictionary suffer from this problem and then introduce some particular process to handle such problem.",
        "In our preliminary experiment, we extracted words from a pre-segmented corpus to form a dictionary, randomly deleted some words from the dictionary and used the modified dictionary in segmentation process based two well-known techniques; Maximum and Longest Matching methods.",
        "The result is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The percentages of accuracy with different percentages of unknown words are explored.",
        "We found out that in case of no unknown words, the accuracy is around 97% in both maximum matching and longest matching but the accuracy drops to 54% and 48% respectively, in case that 50% of words are unknown words.",
        "As the percentage of unknown words rises, the percentage of accuracy drops continuously.",
        "This result reflects seriousness of unknown word problem in word segmentation.1",
        "In this paper, to take care of both known and unknown words, we propose the implementation of a non-dictionary-based system with the knowledge based on the decision tree model ([5]).",

        "For example:ไปหามเหสี (go to see the queen) will be incorrectly segmented as: ไป(go) หาม (carry) เห (deviate) สี (color), while the correct one that cannot be found by the algorithm is: ไป(go) หา(see) มเหสี (Queen)."

        "Nevertheless, when the alternatives have the same number of words, the algorithm cannot determine the best candidate and some other heuristics have to be applied.",

        "From the result, we observed that our method presented the satisfactory in the percentage of accuracy and both in precision and recall compared to those numbers of the original TCC performance.",
        "The TCC corpus has 100% recall but has 52.12% precision, and 44.93% accuracy.",
        "Using the decision tree learned from a Thai corpus, the precision improves up to 94.11-99.85% and the accuracy increases up to 85.51-87.41%.",
        "However, the recall drops to 63.72-94.52%.",
        "For a high CF, say 100 %, recall drops a little because there are few cases to merge two TCCs but precision and accuracy improve dominantly to 63.72% and 62.97, respectively.",
        "For a lower CF, say 50%, recall drops dominantly but precision and accuracy dramatically improve to 94.52% and 85.51% respectively.",
        "However, from 50 to 100% CF, at approximately 80% CF, the accuracy had declined.",
        "The reason to this declination is that with a very high level of merging permission, there are a few chances for removing ‘|’ because of the %CF at those leaves are lower than this permission level.",

        "In conclusion, the appropriate level of merging permission has to be used in order to achieve high accuracy.",

        "Due to the problem of the unknown words that most of the existing Thai word segmentation systems have to cope with, this paper has introduced an alternative method for avoiding such problem.",
        "Our approach is based on using the decision tree as the decision support model with no need of dictionary at all.",
        "The experimental results clearly show that our method gives some promises on achieving high accuracy when suitable and appropriate merging permission factor is used.",
        "In our experiments, the best level of permission that leads to the highest accuracy is approximately equals to 70%, which gives the accuracy equal to 87.41%, as shown in Figure 6.",
        "The dictionary-based method so-called the feature-based system with context independence gives the highest accuracy equals to 99.74% and with context dependence, which has the highest accuracy equals to 95.33% ([3]).",
        "In [1], the Japanese word segmentation is explored based on decision tree.",
        "However, it focuses on the part-of-speech for word segmentation.",
        "Another two well known dictionary-based methods, Maximum and Longest Matching methods, have the accuracy equal to 86.21% and 82.60% respectively when there are 20% of unknown words, which are lower than our system accuracy, and their accuracy drops as percentage of unknown words increases.",
        "By comparing these percentages of accuracy, we can conclude that our method can achieve satisfied accuracy even without dictionary.",
        "Therefore, our method is useful for solving an unknown word problem and it will be even more useful to apply our method to the dictionary-based system in order to improve the system accuracy.",
        "In addition, our results seem to suggest that our method is efficient not only for Thai texts but also for any language when suitable and appropriate syntactic attributes are used.",
        "Our plan for further research is to apply our method to the dictionary based system in order to take care of the unknown word parts.",
        "This would improve the accuracy of the system regardless of the level of the unknown words found in the context."
