        "Question-Answering (QA) systems are useful in that QA systems return the answer itself, while most information retrieval systems return documents that may contain the answer.",

        "In these workshops, the inputs to systems are only single-sentence questions, which are defined as the questions composed of one sentence.",
        "On the other hand, on the web there are a lot of multiple-sentence questions (e.g., answer bank3,AskAnOwner4), which are defined as the questions composed of two or more sentences: For example, \"My computer reboots as soon as it gets started.",
        "OS is Windows XP.",
        "Is there any homepage that tells why it happens?\".",
        "For conventional QA systems, these questions are not expected and existing techniques are not applicable or work poorly to these questions.",
        "Therefore, constructing QA systems that can handle multiple-sentence questions is desirable.",
        "An usual QA system is composed of three components: question processing, document retrieval, and answer extraction.",
        "In question processing, a given question is analyzed, and its question type is determined.",
        "This process is called \"question classification\".",
        "Depending on the question type, the process in the answer extraction component usually changes.",
        "Consequently, the accuracy and the efficiency of answer extraction depend on the accuracy of question classification.",
        "Classification of Multiple-Sentence Questions 427",
        "Therefore, as a first step towards developing a QA system that can handle multiple-sentence questions, we propose a method for classifying multiple-sentence questions.",
        "Specifically, in this work, we treat only questions which require one answer.",
        "For example, if the question \"The icon to return to desktop has been deleted.",
        "Please tell me how to recover it.\"",
        "is given, we would like \"WAY\" to be selected as the question type.",
        "We thus introduce core sentence extraction component, which extracts the most important sentence for question classification.",
        "This is because there are unnecessary sentences for question classification in a multiple-sentence question, and we hope noisy features should be eliminated before question classification with the component.",
        "If a multiple-sentence question is given, we first extract the most important sentence for question classification and then classify the question using the only information in the sentence.",
        "In Section 2, we present the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we explain our proposed method.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our experiments and results, where we can confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "This section presents some existing methods for question classification.",
        "The methods are roughly divided into two groups: the ones based on hand-crafted rules and the ones based on machine learning.",
        "The system \"SAIQA\" [1], Xu et al.",
        "[2] used hand-crafted rules for question classification.",
        "However, methods based on pattern matching have the following two drawbacks: high cost of making rules or patterns by hand and low coverage.",
        "Machine learning can be considered to solve these problems.",
        "Li et al.",
        "[3] used SNoW for question classification.",
        "The SNoW is a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for learning in the presence of a very large number of features.",
        "Zukerman et al.",
        "[4] used decision tree.",
        "Ittycheriah et al.",

        "Suzuki [6] used Support Vector Machines (SVMs).",
        "Suzuki [6] compared question classification using machine learning methods (decision tree, maximum entropy, SVM) with a rule-based method.",
        "The result showed that the accuracy of question classification with SVM is the highest of all.",
        "According to Suzuki [6], a lot of information is needed to improve the accuracy of question classification and SVM is suitable for question classification, because SVM can classify questions with high accuracy even when the dimension of the feature space is large.",
        "Moreover, Zhang et al.",
        "[7] compared question classification with five machine learning algorithms and showed that SVM outperforms the other four methods as Suzuki [6] showed.",
        "Therefore, we also use SVM in classifying questions, as we will explain later.",
        "However, please note that we treat not only usual single-sentence questions, but also multiple-sentence questions.",
        "Furthermore, our work differs from previous work in that we treat real data on the web, not artificial data prepared for the QA task.",
        "From these points, the results in this paper cannot be compared with the ones in the previous work.",

        "The next process changes depending on whether the given question is a single-sentence question or a multiple-sentence question.",
        "If the question consists of a single sentence, the question is sent directly to question classification component.",
        "If the question consists of multiple sentences, the question is sent to core sentence extraction component.",
        "In the component, acore sentence, which is defined as the most important sentence for question classification, is extracted.",
        "Then, the core sentence is sent to the question classification component and the question is classified using the information in the core sentence.",
        "In Figure 1, \"core sentence extraction\" is peculiar to multiple-sentence questions.",

        "Classification of Multiple-Sentence Questions 429",
        "\"I have studied the US history.\"",
        "would be a misleading information in terms of question classification.",

        "We then extract features for constructing a classifier which returns Score(Si).",
        "We use the information on the words as features.",
        "Only the features from the target sentence would not be enough for accurate classification.",
        "This issue is exemplified by the following questions (core sentences are underlined).",
        "Please advise a medication effective for hay fever.",

        "While the sentence \"I want to relieve my headache and stuffy nose.\"",
        "written in boldfaced type is the core sentence in Question 2, the sentence is not suitable as the core sentence in Question 1.",
        "These examples show that the target sentence alone is sometimes not a sufficient evidence for core sentence extraction.",
        "Thus, in classification of a sentence, we use its preceding and following sentences.",
        "For that purpose, we introduce a notion of window size.",
        "\"Window size is n\" means \"the preceding n sentences and the following n sentences in addition to the target sentence are used to make a feature vector\".",
        "For example, if window size is 0, we use only the target sentence.",
        "If window size is oo,we use all the sentences in the question.",
        "We use SVM as a classifier.",
        "We regard the functional distance from the separating hyperplane (i.e., the output of the separating function) as Score(Si).",
        "Word unigrams and word bigrams of the target sentence and the sentences in the window are used as features.",
        "A word in the target sentence and the same word in the other sentences are regarded as two different features.",
        "As discussed in Section 2, we use SVM in the classification of questions.",
        "We use five sets of features: word unigrams, word bigrams, semantic categories of nouns, question focuses, and semantic categories of question focuses.",
        "The semantic categories are obtained from a thesaurus (e.g., SHOP, STATION, CITY).",
        "\"Question focus\" is the word that determines the answer class of the question.",
        "The notion of question focus was described by Moldovan et al.",
        "[8].",
        "For instance, in the question \"What country is â€“ ?",
        "\",the question focusis\"coun-try\".",
        "In many researches, question focuses are extracted with hand-crafted rules.",
        "However, since we treat all kinds of questions including the questions which are not in an interrogative form, such as \"Please teach me -\" and \"I don't know -\", it is difficult to manually create a comprehensive set of rules.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we automatically find the question focus in a core sentence according to the following steps :",
        "step 1 find the phrase5 including the last verb of the sentence or the phrase with \"?\"",
        "at the end.",
        "step 2 find the phrase that modifies the phrase found in step 1.",
        "step 3 output the nouns and the unknown words in the phrase found in step 2.",
        "The output of this procedure is regarded as a question focus.",
        "Although this procedure itself is specific to Japanese, we suppose that we can extract question focus for other languages with a similar simple procedure."
