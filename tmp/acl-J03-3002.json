        "Parallel corpora – bodies of text in parallel translation, also known as bitexts – have taken on an important role in machine translation and multilingual natural language processing.",
        "They represent resources for automatic lexical acquisition (e.g., Gale and Church 1991; Melamed 1997), they provide indispensable training data for statistical translation models (e.g., Brown et al.",
        "1990; Melamed 2000; Och and Ney 2002), and they can provide the connection between vocabularies in cross-language information retrieval (e.g., Davis and Dunning 1995; Landauer and Littman 1990; see also Oard 1997).",
        "More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training: Given a parallel corpus in English and a less resource-rich language, we project English annotations across the parallel corpus to the second language, using word-level alignments as the bridge, and then use robust statistical techniques in learning from the resulting noisy annotations (Cabezas, Dorr, and Resnik 2001; Diab and Resnik 2002; Hwa et al.",
        "2002; Lopez et al.",
        "2002; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Riloff, Schafer, and Yarowsky 2002).",
        "For these reasons, parallel corpora can be thought of as a critical resource.",
        "Unfortunately, they are not readily available in the necessary quantities.",
        "Until very recently, for example, statistical work in machine translation focused heavily on French-English translation because the Canadian parliamentary proceedings (Hansards) in English and French were the only large bitext available.",
        "Things have improved somewhat, but it is still fair to say that for all but a relatively few language pairs, parallel corpora tend to be accessible only in specialized forms such as United Nations proceedings (e.g., via the Linguistic Data Consortium, (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu)), religious texts (Resnik, Olsen, and Diab 1999), localized versions of software manuals (Resnik and",
        "Melamed 1997; Menezes and Richardson 2001), and the like.",
        "Even for the top handful of majority languages, the available parallel corpora tend to be unbalanced, representing primarily governmental or newswire-style texts.",
        "In addition, like other language resources, parallel corpora are often encumbered by fees or licensing restrictions.",
        "For all these reasons, it is difficult to follow the “more data are better data” advice of Church and Mercer (1993), abandoning balance in favor of volume, with respect to parallel text.",
        "Then there is the World Wide Web.",
        "People tend to see the Web as a reflection of their own way of viewing the world – as a huge semantic network, or an enormous historical archive, or a grand social experiment.",
        "We are no different: As computational linguists working on multilingual issues, we view the Web as a great big body of text waiting to be mined, a huge fabric of linguistic data often interwoven with parallel threads.",
        "This article describes our techniques for mining the Web in order to extract the parallel text it contains.",
        "It presents, in revised and considerably extended form, our early work on mining the Web for bilingual text (STRAND) (Resnik 1998, 1999), incorporating new work on content-based detection of translations (Smith 2001, 2002), and efficient exploitation of the Internet Archive.",
        "In Section 2 we lay out the STRAND architecture, which is based on the insight that translated Web pages tend quite strongly to exhibit parallel structure, permitting them to be identified even without looking at content; we also show how we have improved STRAND’s performance by training a supervised classifier using structural parameters rather than relying on manually tuned thresholds.",
        "In Section 3 we present an approach to detecting translations that relies entirely on content rather than structure, demonstrating performance comparable to STRAND’s using this orthogonal source of information.",
        "In Section 4 we describe how we have adapted the STRAND approach to the Internet Archive, dramatically improving our ability to identify parallel Web pages on a large scale.",
        "Section 5 puts all the pieces together, using structural and combined content-structure matching of pages on the Internet Archive in order to obtain a sizable corpus of English-Arabic Web document pairs.",

        "STRAND (Resnik 1998, 1999) is an architecture for structural translation recognition, acquiring natural data.",
        "Its goal is to identify pairs of Web pages that are mutual translations.",
        "In order to do this, it exploits an observation about the way that Web page authors disseminate information in multiple languages: When presenting the same content in two different languages, authors exhibit a very strong tendency to use the same document structure (e.g., Figure 1).",
        "STRAND therefore locates pages that might be translations of each other, via a number of different strategies, and filters out page pairs whose page structures diverge by too much.",
        "In this section we describe how STRAND works, and we also discuss several related Web-mining methods, focusing on the overall architecture these systems have in common and the important system-specific variations.",

        "Finding parallel text on the Web consists of three main steps:",
        "• Location of pages that might have parallel translations",
        "Example of a candidate pair.",
        "• Generation of candidate pairs that might be translations • Structural filtering out of nontranslation candidate pairs We consider each of these steps in turn.",
        "using the AltaVista search engine’s (http://www.av.com) advanced search to search for two types of Web pages: parents and siblings.",
        "A parent page is one that contains hypertext links to different-language versions of a document; for example, if we were looking for English and French bitexts, the page at the left in Figure 2 would lead us to one such candidate pair.",
        "To perform this search for the English-French language pair, we ask AltaVista for pages in any language that satisfy this Boolean expression: (anchor: \"english\" OR anchor: \"anglais\") AND (anchor: \"french\" OR anchor: \"fran¸cais\").",
        "A 10-line distance filter is used to restrict attention to pages on which the English and French pointers occur reasonably close to one another – specifically, those for which the regular expression (in Perl) / (english |anglais) / is satisfied within 10 lines of the Perl regular expression / (french |fran\\w+ais) / in the HTML source.",
        "This helps filter out a page that contained, for example, a link to “English literature courses” and also contained an unrelated link to “French version” at the top.",
        "A sibling page is a page in one language that itself contains a link to a version of the same page in another language; for example, the page at the right of Figure 2 contains a link on the left that says “This page in english.” To perform this search for English pages matching a given French page, we request pages in French that match the Boolean expression anchor: \"english\" OR anchor: \"anglais\".",
        "More recent versions of STRAND (unpublished) have added a “spider” component for locating pages that might have translations.",
        "Given a list of Web sites thought to contain bilingual text for a given language pair (e.g., sites identified using the AltaVista-based search), it is possible to download all the pages on each site, any",
        "Excerpts from a parent page (left) and a sibling page (right).",
        "The parent page is in Italian and contains links marked “Italiano/Italian,” “Francese/French,” and “Inglese/English.” The sibling page is in Dutch and contains a link marked “This page in english” in the leftmost column.",
        "of which might have a translation on that site.",
        "Although simple to implement, this method of locating pages shifts the burden of narrowing down the possibilities to the process of generating candidate document pairs.",
        "The results reported here do not make use of the spider.",
        "2.1.2 Generating Candidate Pairs.",
        "Pairing up potentially translated pages is simple when a search engine has been used to generate parent or sibling pages: One simply pairs the two child pages to which the parent links, or the sibling page together with the page to which it links.",
        "When all the pages on a site are under consideration, the process is rather different.",
        "The simplest possibility is to separate the pages on a site into the two languages of interest using automatic language identification (Ingle 1976; Beesley 1988; Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994), throwing away any pages that are not in either language, and then generate the cross product.",
        "This potentially leads to a very large number of candidate page pairs, and there is no particular reason to believe that most of them are parallel translations, other than the fact that they appear on the same Web site.",
        "The spider component of STRAND adds a URL-matching stage, exploiting the fact that the directory structure on many Web sites reflects parallel organization when pages are translations of each other.",
        "Matching is performed by manually creating a list of substitution rules (e.g., english – > big5),1 and for each English URL, applying all possible rules to generate URLs that might appear on the list of pages for the other language.",
        "If such a URL is found, the pair with similar URLs is added to the list of candidate document pairs.",
        "For example, suppose an English-Chinese site contains a page with URL (http://mysite.com/english/homeen.html), on which one combination of substitutions might produce the URL (http://mysite.com/big5/homech.html).",
        "The original page and the produced URL are probably worth considering as a likely candidate pair.",
        "Owing to the combinatorics (an exponential number of possible substitutions), only a fixed number of substitution combinations can be tried per English URL; however, in Section 4.3 we describe a more scalable URL-matching algorithm.",
        "Another possible criterion for matching is the use of document lengths.",
        "Texts that are translations of one another tend to be similar in length, and it is reasonable to assume that for text E in language 1 and text F in language 2, length(E) ≈ C · length(F), where C is a constant tuned for the language pair.",
        "The use of a document length filter is described in Smith (2001), in which such a filter is shown, at the sentence level, to reduce the size of the search space exponentially in the confidence p in a (1 − p) confidence interval for a linear regression model with only linear loss of good pairs.",
        "relies on analysis of the pages’ underlying HTML to determine a set of pair-specific structural values, and then uses those values to decide whether the pages are translations of one another.",
        "The first step in this process is to linearize the HTML structure and ignore the actual linguistic content of the documents.",
        "We do not attempt to exploit nonlinear structure (e.g., embedded chunks), for two reasons.",
        "First, we suspect that many HTML authors use tags for formatting text rather than for indicating document structure; therefore any “tree” structure is likely to be inconsistent or poorly matched.",
        "Second, we required the matching algorithm to be fast, and algorithms for aligning tree structures are more demanding than those for linear structures.",
        "Both documents in the candidate pair are run through a markup analyzer that acts as a transducer, producing a linear sequence containing three kinds of token: [START:element_label] [END:element_label] [Chunk : length] e.g., [START:A], [START:LI] e.g., [END:A] e.g., [Chunk: 174] The chunk length is measured in nonwhitespace bytes, and the HTML tags are normalized for case.",
        "Attribute-value pairs within the tags are treated as nonmarkup text (e.g., <FONT COLOR=\"BLUE\"> produces [START:FONT] followed by [Chunk:12]).",
        "The second step is to align the linearized sequences using a standard dynamic programming technique (Hunt and McIlroy 1975).",
        "For example, consider two documents that begin as follows:",
        "Using this alignment, we compute four scalar values that characterize the quality of the alignment: dp The difference percentage, indicating nonshared material (i.e., alignment tokens that are in one linearized file but not the other).",
        "n The number of aligned nonmarkup text chunks of unequal length.",
        "r The correlation of lengths of the aligned nonmarkup chunks.",
        "p The significance level of the correlation r. The difference percentage (dp) quantifies the extent to which there are mismatches in the alignment: sequence tokens on one side that have no corresponding token on the other side.",
        "In the example above, one document contains an H1 header that is missing from the second document.",
        "Large numbers of such mismatches can indicate that the two documents do not present the same material to a great enough extent to be considered translations.",
        "This can happen, for example, when two documents are translations up to a point (e.g., an introduction), but one document goes on to include a great deal more content than another.",
        "Even more frequently, the difference percentage is high when two documents are prima facie bad candidates for a translation pair.",
        "The number of aligned nonmarkup text chunks (n) helps characterize the quality of the alignment.",
        "The dynamic programming algorithm tries to optimize the correspondence of identical tokens, which represent markup.2 As a side effect, the nonmarkup text chunks are placed in correspondence with one another (e.g., the “Emergency Exit” and “Sortie de Secours” chunks in the above example).",
        "The more such pairings are found, the more likely the candidate documents are to represent a valid translation pair.",
        "The remaining two parameters (r and p) quantify the extent to which the corresponding nonmarkup chunks are correlated in length.",
        "When two documents are aligned with one another and are valid translations, there is a reliably linear relationship in the length of translated chunks of text: short pieces correspond with short pieces, medium with medium, and long with long.",
        "The Pearson correlation coefficient r for the lengths will be closer to one when the alignment has succeeded in lining up translated pieces of text, and the p value quantifies the reliability of the correlation; for example, the standard threshold of p < .05 indicates 95% confidence that the correlation was not obtained by chance.",
        "In our original work, we used fixed thresholds, determined manually by inspection of development (nontest) data for English-Spanish, to decide whether a candidate pair should be kept or filtered out.",
        "Thresholds of dp < 20% and p < 0.05 were used."

        "As with most search tasks, performance at finding parallel Web pages can be evaluated using standard measures of precision and recall and by combining those figures using the F-measure.",
        "It is not possible for us to measure recall relative to the entire set of document pairs that should have been found; this would require exhaustive evaluation using the entire Web, or pooling results from a large number of different systems, as is done in the TREC information retrieval evaluations.",
        "Therefore, recall in this setting is measured relative to the set of candidate pairs that was generated.",
        "Since the “truth” in this task is a matter for human judgment, we rely on bilingual speakers to judge independently whether page pairs are actually translations of each other for any given test set.",
        "In our experience no bilingual speaker is completely comfortable saying that another person’s translation is a good translation, so in creating the gold standard, we instead ask, “Was this pair of pages intended to provide the same content in the two different languages?” Asking the question in this way leads to high rates of interjudge agreement, as measured using Cohen’s κ measure.",
        "2.2.1 Using Manually Set Parameters.",
        "Using the manually set thresholds for dp and n, we have obtained 100% precision and 68.6% recall in an experiment using STRAND to find English-French Web pages (Resnik 1999).",
        "In that experiment, 326 candidate pairs, randomly selected from a larger set of 16,763 candidates, were judged by two human annotators.",
        "The humans agreed (i.e., both marked a page “good” or both marked a page “bad”) on 261 page pairs (86 “good” and 175 “bad”), and it is relative to those 261 that we compute recall.",
        "A modified version of STRAND was used to obtain English-Chinese pairs (see related work, below), and in a similar formal evaluation, we found that the resulting set had 98% precision and 61% recall for Chinese (http://umiacs.umd.edu/∼resnik/strand/).",
        "Both these results are consistent with our preliminary findings for English-Spanish using a less rigorous evaluation (using the judgments of the first author rather than independent bilingual evaluators) and a very small test set; precision in this preliminary experiment was near ceiling and recall was in the vicinity of 60% (Resnik 1998).",
        "2.2.2 Assessing the STRAND Data.",
        "Although our focus here is finding parallel text, not using it, a natural question is whether parallel text from the Web is in fact of value.",
        "Two sources of evidence suggest that it is.",
        "First, Web-based parallel corpora have already demonstrated their utility in cross-language information retrieval experiments.",
        "Resnik, Oard, and Levow (2001) showed that a translation lexicon automatically extracted from the French-English STRAND data could be combined productively with a bilingual French-English dictionary in order to improve retrieval results using a standard cross-language IR test collection (English queries against the CLEF-2000 French collection, which contains approximately 21 million words from articles in Le Monde).",
        "During document translation, backing off from the dictionary to the STRAND translation lexicon accounted for over 8% of the lexicon matches (by token), reducing the number of untranslatable terms by a third and producing a statistically significant 12% relative improvement in mean average precision as compared to using the dictionary alone.",
        "Similarly, Nie and Cai (2001) have demonstrated improved cross-language IR results for English and Chinese using data gathered by the PTMiner system (Chen and Nie 2000), a related approach that we discuss in Section 2.3.",
        "Second, since bag-of-words IR experiments are not very illuminating with respect to fluency and translation quality, we conducted a ratings-based assessment of English-Chinese data, asking two native Chinese speakers (who are fluent in English) to assign ratings to a set of English-Chinese items.",
        "The set contained:",
        "• 30 human-translated sentence pairs from the FBIS (Release 1) English-Chinese parallel corpus, sampled at random.",
        "• 30 Chinese sentences from the FBIS corpus, sampled at random, paired with their English machine translation output from AltaVista’s Babelfish (http: //babelfish.altavista.com).",
        "• 30 paired items from Chinese-English Web data, sampled at random from “sentence-like” aligned chunks as identified using the HTML-based chunk alignment process of Section 2.1.3.",
        "The human-translated and machine-translated pairs were included in order to provide upper-bound and lower-bound comparisons.",
        "The items were presented to one judge in a random order, and to the other judge in the reverse order.",
        "Chinese-English Web data were those collected by Jinxi Xu using a modified version of STRAND (see Section 2.3), excluding those that did not pass STRAND’s structural filter with the manually set thresholds.",
        "Sentence-like chunk pairs were defined as those in which the English side was 5–50 whitespace-delimited tokens long and that began with an uppercase alphabetic character and contained at least one token from an English stop list.",
        "3 This fairly strict filter provided a set of approximately 7,000 pairs from which the 30 test items were sampled.",
        "Participants were asked to provide each pair of items with three ratings, assessing English fluency, Chinese fluency, and adequacy of the translation.",
        "The choice and wording of the ratings criteria were derived from the human evaluation measures proposed by Dabbadie et al.",
        "(2002), with the wording of the translation assessment criterion modified to eliminate references to the direction of translation.",
        "(See Appendix B.)",
        "For all three measures, the two judges’ ratings were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001).",
        "Figure 3 shows additional quantitative results of the assessment, comparing judgments among human-translated, Web-generated, and machine-translated data.",
        "The ratings indicate that pairs from the Web contain on average somewhere between “mostly the same meaning” and “entirely the same meaning” (median 3.25).4 In comparison, current commercial-quality machine translation output achieves performance only between “much of the same meaning” and “mostly the same meaning” (median 2.5).",
        "Moreover, it is very likely that the Web translation quality is an underestimate: Some of the low-scoring outliers within the Web data could be eliminated by using state-of-the-art sentence alignment techniques and automatic detection and",
        "Translation adequacy ratings: Distribution over scores for human-translated (Human), Web-generated (WWW), and machine-translated (MT) data.",
        "The left plot provides results for judge 1, the right plot for judge 2.",
        "elimination of noisy pairs at the sentence level (cf. Nie and Cai [2001]).",
        "We observe that the distribution of scores for Web data peaks at the highest rating and that the data are in both cases modestly bimodally distributed.",
        "Machine-translated pairs, on the other hand, have generally lower quality.",
        "This suggests that high-quality parallel translations are present in this corpus and that poor-quality parallel translations are very poor (whether because of misalignment or simply because of poor translation quality at the document level) and might therefore be easily distinguishable from the better material.",
        "We plan to address this in future work.",
        "Qualitatively, the results are a source of optimism about parallel data from the Web.",
        "Looking monolingually, fluency of the English side is statistically comparable to that of English sentences from the FBIS parallel corpus (essentially at ceiling), and on average the Chinese Web data are judged somewhere between “fairly fluent” and “very fluent,” with the median at “very fluent” (only the second judge found the fluency of the Chinese Web sentences to be significantly worse than the human-generated Chinese sentences, Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.02).",
        "several language pairs, it appears that STRAND’s structure-based filter consistently throws out around one-third of the candidate document pairs it has found in order to maintain its precision in the 98–100% range.",
        "It does so by respecting parameter thresholds that were determined manually using English-Spanish development data; the same parameters seem to have worked reasonably well not only for English-Spanish, but also for English-French and English-Chinese pairs.",
        "It is possible, however, that classification can be tuned for better performance.",
        "In order to investigate this possibility, we took a machine-learning approach: We used the four structural values (dp, n, r, and p) as features characterizing each document pair and treated the problem as a binary decision task, using supervised learning to make an attempt at better predicting human judgments.",
        "Using the English-French data, we constructed a ninefold cross-validation experiment using decision tree induction to predict the class assigned by the human judges.",
        "The decision tree software was the widely used C5.0 (http://www.rulequest.com/ demoeula.html).",
        "We used a decision tree learner because it is transparent (it is easy to see which features are being used to classify page pairs).",
        "In addition, a decision tree produced by C5.0 can be translated into a fast C program that is a rapid classifier of document pairs.",
        "Each fold had 87 test items and 174 training items; the fraction of good and bad pairs in each fold’s test and training sets was roughly equal to the overall division (33% to 67%, respectively).",
        "Precision and recall results are reported in Table 1, together with baseline results from STRAND’s untuned classifier as reported above.",
        "Looking at the decision trees learned, we see that they are very similar to one another.",
        "In every case a tree that looked like the following was learned:",
        "else... where the remaining branch involved various additional partitionings of the candidate pairs that had few aligned text chunks (small n) and relatively low (but perhaps unreliable) difference percentage (dp).",
        "That branch handled around 10% of the document set and was prone to overtraining.",
        "(The documents handled by this branch were mostly marked “bad” by the judges but appear to have been difficult to classify based",
        "on the structural features.)",
        "Note that the learned classifiers were substantially different from the heuristic threshold used earlier.",
        "Without tuning, the manually set parameters result in good document pairs’ being discarded 31% of the time.",
        "Our cross-validation results indicate that tuning the parameters cuts that figure in half: Only 16% of the good pairs will be discarded, at a cost of admitting 4 false positives from every 100 candidate pairs.",
        "This approach is quite general and uses only a minimum of language-dependent knowledge.",
        "The features we are using are the same for any language pair.",
        "The tuning process needs to be done only once per language pair and requires only a few hours of annotation from untrained speakers of both languages to obtain the small labeled sample."

        "In addition, we used a list of .com domains known to originate in Arabic-speaking countries.",
        "This list provided an additional 21 specific domains (e.g., (emiratesbank.com), (checkpoint.com)); note that the list is by no means exhaustive.",
        "In the experiments we report here, we mined two crawls from 2001, comprising 8TB and 12TB (i.e., less than one-sixth of the Archive as it existed at the time of the mining effort in early 2002) spread over 27 machines.",
        "Our list of URLs with relevant domains, obtained through pattern matching in Archive index files, numbers 19,917,923 pages.22 The language-specific substrings given earlier were subtracted from these URLs to generate handles, resulting in 786,880 buckets with an average of 25 pages per bucket.",

        "This number is lower than what might be expected, given the huge number of buckets, because many buckets were monolingual; note that only pairs of one English and one Arabic document are deemed to be candidates.",
        "A random sample of two hundred candidate pairs was given to two human evaluators, bilingual in English and Arabic, who were asked (independently) to answer, for each pair, the question “Is this pair of pages intended to show the same material to two different users, one a reader of English and the other a reader of Arabic?” The judges’ answers showed a Cohen’s κ agreement of 0.6955, which is generally considered fair to good reliability.",

        "Taking the set of 149 labeled pairs on which the two judges agreed (134 were marked “good,” 15 “bad”), we carried out an evaluation of the full candidate set similar to the one for English-French discussed in Section 2.2.3.",
        "This was a threefold cross-validation experiment in which decision tree classifiers were tuned on the features extracted for each candidate pair by structure-based classification .23 In addition to the four structural scores, we included two language identification confidence scores (one for the English page, one for the Arabic page); these were available as part of the Internet Archive’s bookkeeping information for each URL and required no additional computation on our part.",
        "Table 5 shows precision and recall of each fold’s classifier applied to the corresponding test set of page pairs.",
        "The value of the parameter-tuning process is dramatically confirmed by comparing the learned parameters with STRAND’s default parameters (manually determined by Resnik [1999]).",
        "Note, however, that the candidate generation system is highly precise to begin with; only around 10% of the pairs in the random sample of candidates were considered “bad” by both judges.",
        "A baseline system in which no filtering is done at all achieves 89.93% precision on the full labeled set (with 100% recall).",
        "Depending on the relative importance of precision and recall, these structure-based classifiers might be considered worse than that baseline.",
        "Upon inspection, we discovered that nearly 5,000 of the pairs in our candidate set were from a single domain, (maktoob.com).",
        "This site supports an online marketplace, and many of the pages discovered by our search were dedicated to specific merchandise categories within that service; a large portion of these were simply “no items available” and one or two similar messages.",
        "We ignored this domain completely in order to be conservative about the yield of page pairs, though we note that many of the pages within it are legitimate parallel text that could be extracted if a good duplicates filter were applied.24 In order to construct a final classifier, we trained a decision tree on all 149 of the manually judged examples on which both judges agreed.",
        "This was then applied to the candidate pairs, producing a set of 1,741 HTML document pairs hypothesized to be valid translations of one another.",
        "By way of simple duplicate detection, if a pair of URLs appeared multiple times (under case-insensitive matching), it was counted only once.",
        "(Note that when this occurs, the duplicate pair will differ by at least one time stamp, and therefore a more sophisticated technique for eliminating duplication might extract more text.)",
        "The remaining set contained 1,399 pairs .25 Converting from HTML to plain text and tokenizing, the English documents in this corpus total approximately 673,108 tokens, with an average of 481 tokens per document; the Arabic side contains 845,891 tokens, averaging 605 tokens per document.26"

        "Because Arabic is a highly inflected language with many surface forms, we found it necessary to use morphological preprocessing in order to make effective use of a dictionary.",
        "For English, we tokenized the text and used the WordNet lemmatizer to strip suffixes.",
        "The Arabic texts were tokenized at punctuation, then romanized and converted to root forms using a morphological analysis tool (Darwish 2002).",
        "This approximately halved the vocabulary size for the Arabic texts (from 89,047 types to 48,212 types).",
        "The translation lexicon used to compute tsim contained 52,211 entries, each containing one English lemma and one Arabic root.27 Of these, 16,944 contained two items that were both present in the candidate set of 8,294 Web page pairs.",
        "The approximations discussed in Section 3.2.2 were employed: Competitive linking on the first 500 words in each document was used to compute the score.",
        "Carrying out the same cross-validation experiment (on the same random split of data), the combined structural and content-based classifier produced the results in Table 6.",
        "Also shown is the performance of the tsim-only classifier, assuming an 24 One of our human evaluators confirmed that no other domains appeared to significantly dominate the candidate pairs as did (maktoob.com), providing some assurance that the rest of the data are diverse.",
        "25 Within that set, some documents (not pairs) were present multiple times; there were 1,385 unique (apart from case) English URLs and 1,385 unique (apart from case) URLs.",
        "Since this is only a 1% duplication rate for each language, we did not attempt to filter further.",
        "optimal threshold is chosen.",
        "Averaged over three folds, the classifier achieved 95.06% precision and 98.48% recall (1.8% and 5.24% better than without tsim, respectively).",
        "After building a single classifier on all 149 test pairs (the set on which both human judges agreed), we reclassified the entire candidate set.",
        "Ignoring again pages from the (maktoob.com) domain, 2,206 pairs were marked as translations.",
        "The same crude duplicate filter was applied, cutting the set back to 1,821 pairs.28 Table 7 shows word counts for various tokenization schemes: the morphological analysis used for computing tsim, the Egypt tokenizer (which is aggressive), and counting only tokens with some alphabetic character from the Egypt tokenizer (a conservative approximation).",
        "The analogous results, using the classifier from Section 5.2, are shown for comparison.",
        "To summarize the results, using the content-based similarity score as a feature not only improved precision, it increased the size of the corpus (in words) by 51–63%, depending on the tokenization scheme.29"

        "A number of the techniques we have used to mine parallel data from the Web can be improved, and we suggest here some directions.",
        "28 There were 1,796 unique English URLs and 1,779 unique Arabic URLs, giving document duplication rates of 1.4% and 2.4%, respectively.",
        "29 A list of Wayback Machine URLs is available at (http://umiacs.umd.edu/ – resnik/strand/); a sample of the document pairs is included in Appendix A.",
        "With respect to classifying document pairs as translations, the reader will notice that our approach to content-based cross-lingual similarity essentially boils down to a greedy matching of some of the words in a document pair using a dictionary.",
        "It remains to be seen whether weights in the dictionary can be exploited (Smith [2001] suggests that empirically estimated joint translation probabilities for word pairs are not useful).",
        "We suggest that the incorporation of scores from information retrieval (e.g., inverse document frequency) might be useful in discerning which lexicon entries are the strongest cues of translational equivalence.",
        "We also have not explored any filtering on the noisy translation lexicon; doing so might improve the quality of the tsim score.",
        "The competitive linking approximation (which, without weights, is essentially random matching of word pairs) and the use of only the initial portion of each document provide significant computational savings.",
        "In our experience, neither of these has significantly hurt the performance of tsim-based classifiers (as compared to finding the maximum cardinality bipartite matching and/or using the full documents), and in some cases competitive linking seems to improve performance.",
        "It is possible that some sample selection of words from document candidates might be profitable (e.g., creating a sample of size proportional to the document length, as opposed to a fixed size, or sampling only from content words, or sampling only words present in the dictionary).",
        "Smith (2002) suggested a bootstrapping paradigm for the construction of parallel corpora.",
        "Beginning with a seed set of translation information (either parallel corpora or a bilingual dictionary), high-precision initial classifiers might be constructed using content and/or structural features (whichever are available).",
        "We might then iteratively select additional page pairs in which the current classifier has high confidence of translational equivalence, gradually increasing the pool of parallel data and at the same time expanding the bilingual lexicon.",
        "This approach to minimally supervised classifier construction has been widely studied (Yarowsky 1995), especially in cases in which the features of interest are orthogonal in some sense (e.g., Blum and Mitchell 1998; Abney 2002).",
        "With respect to the generation of candidate pairs, we have described a progression from index-based searches on AltaVista to exhaustive matching of URLs on the Internet Archive.",
        "The combination of these approaches may be profitable, particularly for languages that are represented only very sparsely on the Web.",
        "For such languages, index-based searches on words from a language of interest might be used to identify sites potentially containing parallel text.",
        "Within such sites, it would likely be profitable to look for parallel documents in the full cross product of documents in the two languages of interest, obtained both on the Internet Archive and via crawling all pages on relevant sites.",
        "Finally, we plan to utilize parallel texts mined from the Web in our work on machine translation and acquisition of bilingual lexicons, and in the creation of resources for new languages via projection of annotations from English."

      "heading": "7. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "Although efforts at discovering parallel text on the Web were first reported in 1998, Web-based parallel corpora appear to have had only a limited impact on the community.",
        "Three reasons for this suggest themselves.",
        "Too few languages.",
        "Parallel text from the Web has been made available to the community in only a few pairs of languages.",
        "As of this writing, the STRAND Web site (http://umiacs.umd.edu/ – resnik/strand/), presenting URL pairs discovered via STRAND runs, contains collections only for English-French, English-Chinese, English",
        "Basque, and now English-Arabic, and we are not aware of any other efforts to disseminate Web-based parallel data publicly.",
        "Up to this point, it simply has not been easy to search the Web for parallel text in new language pairs.",
        "The most difficult part is finding the candidates: A year or two ago, we attempted to apply the original Web-based STRAND to the problem of finding English-Arabic text, and we were unable to locate enough search engine hits or sites to yield useful results.",
        "Too little data.",
        "Very large Web-based parallel text collections are not available to the community.",
        "The largest appear to have been obtained by Chen and Nie (2000), who acquired collections on the order of 15,000 document pairs for English-French, English-German, English-Dutch, English-Italian, and English-Chinese using the PTMiner system.",
        "However, these collections have not been made available to the general community.30 In contrast, the STRAND collections, which are available to the community in the form of URL pairs, are modest in size: The English-Chinese collection contains fewer than 3,500 document pairs, and the English-French fewer than 2,500.",
        "Difficulty with dissemination.",
        "Web-based collections are difficult to distribute.",
        "Standard mechanisms of the sort used by the LDC (a CD or downloadable file) are fraught with difficult legal issues, since, technically speaking, redistributing the actual content of Web pages could require permission from the author of every page.",
        "For example, presumably as a risk reduction strategy, the Web track for TREC-2002 (Text Retrieval Conference) limited its attention to the .gov domain and required the recipient of the data to sign a form that reduced the distributor’s liability.31 Similarly, the Google Programming Contest data set arrived with a limited-use license, indemnification from third-party claims, and a collection limited to the .edu domain, from which, presumably, authors are less likely to bring expensive lawsuits (http://www.google.com/programming-contest/).",
        "A possible fourth reason may have to do with questions about the utility of the data.",
        "For example, a Web-based parallel collection may be unpredictable in terms of its coverage, and the community is well aware of the dangers of using training data that are not representative of the test domain.",
        "A solution to this problem might be to extract topically relevant subsets of the collection for particular domains or applications, but of course this requires a “more is better” approach in order to obtain subsets that are large enough to be useful.",
        "The work reported in this article addresses each of these major problems.",
        "With respect to the number of language pairs, the Internet Archive offers us a huge sample of pages on the Web, and our techniques make it easy to explore that collection in an efficient way.",
        "Although it is probably impossible to crawl more than a small fraction of the Web, the Internet Archive is storing the results of commercial-scale Web crawling and has as its explicit mission the permanent storage of everything that can be found.",
        "The fact that we were able to find a substantial quantity of English-Arabic text (on the order of a million words per side, looking at less than a sixth of the Archive in 2002) offers the hope that it will be possible to find data for the less well-represented language pairs, if and when those data actually exist.",
        "Moreover, the final implementation we described here retains the almost entirely language-independent character of the original STRAND system, adding only the requirement of a reasonable translation",
        "lexicon.",
        "Therefore success in mining for parallel text in other languages depends primarily on whether the data exist in the Archive.",
        "With regard to corpus size, we demonstrated that the recall of structural matching, and hence its yield, can be significantly improved by simple and automatic classifier construction, requiring only a few hours’ work from a bilingual annotator to create the training material.",
        "These results are further improved by adding content-based similarity as a feature.",
        "Our success with English-Arabic, a language pair that is not one of those usually considered well represented on the Web, encourages us to believe that for other languages of interest, we will be similarly successful.",
        "We have also done a bit of exploration to gauge the potential of the Archive for better-represented language pairs, using English-Chinese as an example.",
        "By way of context, Chen and Nie (2000) reported that PTMiner found around 15,000 English-Chinese document pairs by crawling 185 sites in the .hk (Hong Kong) domain, with the run taking about a week.",
        "We did a STRAND search of the two Internet Archive crawls used in the English-Arabic study, seeking English-Chinese parallel text in multiple domains where Chinese is a dominant language (e.g., .hk, .tw, .cn).",
        "Our initial candidate pair set was generated in approximately 30 hours, and contains over 70,000 candidate page pairs.",
        "We are optimistic that this can be improved still further by expanding the search to include all sites that contain at least one Chinese document, regardless of the domain.",
        "In terms of dissemination, the STRAND distribution mechanism models itself after Web search engines, distributing the URLs rather than the pages themselves.",
        "This places the legal burden on individual users, who are presumably safe under fair use provisions if they download pages for their individual use.",
        "Until recently the difficulty with this solution has been that the collection of URLs deteriorates over time as sites disappear, pages are reorganized, and underlying content changes: For example, in April 2002, we attempted to download the documents in the STRAND English-French, English-Chinese, and English-Basque collections, and we were able to access successfully only around 67%, 43%, and 40% of the URL pairs, respectively.",
        "However, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine provides a way to distribute persistent URLs.",
        "With regard to the quality of the data, in Section 2.2.2 we discussed two studies that demonstrate the utility of parallel Web data in acquiring translation lexicons for cross-language information retrieval.",
        "We also reported on the results of a human ratings study, which provided evidence that English-Chinese data mined from the Web contain reasonably fluent, reasonably translated sentence pairs.",
        "It is worth pointing out that, because STRAND expects pages to be very similar in structural terms, the resulting document collections are particularly amenable to sentence or segment-level alignment.",
        "Indeed, just using dynamic programming to align the markup, ignoring the text, produces reasonable first-pass alignments of the intervening text as a side effect.",
        "We are currently adapting statistical text-based sentence alignment techniques to take advantage of the markup available in Web-based document pairs.",
        "Ultimately, the utility of parallel data from the Web is a question that will need to be addressed in practice.",
        "The potential, of course, is as rich and diverse as the Web itself, and what we as researchers can do with it is an exciting question that remains to be answered."
