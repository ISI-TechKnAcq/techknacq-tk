      "heading": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": [
        "The above stack-search algorithms have been implemented in a prototype implementation which uses real speech input, but does not yet have all of the features of the Lincoln TS CSR [13,14,15].",
        "(The primary missing feature is crossword phonetic modeling.)",
        "The prototype runs faster than does the TS system on the corresponding recognition task, frequently by a significant factor.",
        "(In fairness, the TS system does not include a fast match.)",
        "Current experience using the DARPA Resource Management Database [17] shows the required number of stack pops and the stack size to be surprisingly small.",
        "In addition, the prototype includes a proposed CSR-NL interface [12] and has been run with unigram, word-pair, bigram, and trigram language models accessed through the interface without difficulty.",
        "(It has also been run using a no-grammar language model, which, of course, does not require the interface.)",
        "This prototype implementation has also been tested with vocabulary sizes up to 64K words.",
        "The CSR computation, which is dominated by the fast match, scales approximately as the square root of the vocabulary size.",
        "Methods for joining the acoustic matching of separate theories and caching of acoustic computations to reduce the acoustic match computation were described in reference [16].",
        "These algorithms were tested in a stack-decoder simulator (real stack decoder with simulated input data).",
        "The path join accelerator is used in the prototype stack decoder to remove copies of theories which are identical except for non-grammatical items such as optional intermediate silences.",
        "A* search using the scoring function described by Nilsson [11] (equation 6) requires computing the likelihood of the future data (h*(t) in equation 7).",
        "The optimal A* decoder requires exact evaluation of h* (t) which requires solving the top-1 recognition problem by some other means, such as a reverse direction TS decoder [19], before the A* search can begin.",
        "The alternative described here substitutes a near-optimal scoring function which is derived from the A* search and requires negligible additional computation over that required by the search itself.",
        "Since, as noted above, the Lincoln top-1 TS decoder takes more CPU time than does the near-optimal stack decoder, the near-optimal stack decoder algorithm appears to be the most efficient of the",
        "three approaches for top-1 recognition.",
        "In addition, the long-span language model version of the stack decoder can very easily integrate long-span language models into the search.",
        "However, if top-N recognition is the goal, the optimal A* search may be preferred because, once the price is paid for computing h* (t), the A* search can find the additional N-1 sentences very efficiently for no-grammar/unigram language models [19].",
        "Recently, several other algorithms have been proposed for top-N recognition using A* search [9,19,22] which use the Nilsson formulation of the scoring function.",
        "All of these approaches use a reverse direction TS decoder to compute h*(t).",
        "(A reverse direction top-1 stack decoder could also be used to compute h* (t).)",
        "(There are also some proposed non-A* methods for recognizing the top-N sentences [1,18,21].",
        "In general, the bidirectional approaches appear to be more efficient than the unidirectional approaches.)",
        "These bidirectional A* methods must wait for the end of data (or a pseudo-end-of-data [9]) to begin the A* (or the reverse direction) pass.",
        "In contrast, because they do not need data beyond that necessary to extend the current theory (this includes data up to t_ref required to choose the current theory), the two stack decoder formulations proposed here can proceed totally left-to-right as the input data becomes available from the front end.",
        "The long-span language-model version of the stack search will output all top-N theories with minimal delay following the end-of-data because all theories are pursued in quasi-parallel or, in top-1 mode, it can output the partial sentence as soon as all unpruned theories have a common partial history (initial word sequence).",
        "(A similar technique for continuous output after a short delay from continuous input exists for TS decoders [20].)",
        "One of the motivations for some of these other A* (and top-N) algorithms is as a method for using weaker and cheaper initial acoustic and language models to produce a top-N sentence list for later refinement by more detailed and expensive acoustic and/or language models, which now need only consider a few theories.",
        "In contrast the algorithm proposed here integrates both the detailed acoustic and language models directly in the stack search and therefore need only produce a top-1 output.",
        "It attempts to minimize the computation by applying all available information to constrain the search.",
        "(The stack decoder as described here can, of course, also be used with weak and cheap acoustic and/or language models to produce a top-N list for later processing.)",
        "The ultimate choice between the two methods may be determined by the number of sentences required by the top-N approaches and the relative computational costs of the various modules in each system.",
        "The architectural simplicity of each system may also have some bearing.",
        "The stack decoder has long shown promise for integrating long-span language models and acoustic models into a single effective search which applies information from both sources into controlling the search.",
        "It has not been used at many sites, primarily due to the difficulty of making the search efficient.",
        "The algorithms described above will hopefully remove this barrier."

        "Nilsson [11] states the optimal A* criterion (slightly rewritten to match the speech recognition problem) as",
        "where f1(t) is the log-likelihood of a sentence with the partial theory i ending at time t, g(t) is the log-likelihood of partial theory i, and h* (t) is the log-likelihood of the best extension of any theory from time t to the end of the data.",
        "(Nilsson uses costs which are interpreted here as negative log-likelihoods.",
        "All descriptions here will use sign conventions appropriate for log-likelihoods to be consistent with the rest of the paper.)",
        "The theory argmax (max fi(t)) is chosen as the next to be popped from the stack and expanded.",
        "Equation 6 requires that the computation of the total likelihood of a sentence must be separable into a beginning part and an end part separated by a single time, which disallows this derivation for the full (forward) decoder because the full decoder does not have a unique transition time between two words.",
        "Thus, the derivation is limited to a decoder which is Viterbi between words.",
        "It also limits the derivation to non-cross-word acoustic models and no-grammar or unigram language model recognition tasks.",
        "for the best theory with a word transition at time t. The function f* (t) is slowly varying with global maxima at the word transition points of the correct theory, at which points it equals the likelihood of the correct theory.",
        "Specifically, it is maximum at t = 0 and t = T. (T is the end of data.)",
        "Since g(t) is an exact value (rather than a bound or estimate) for a tree search, g*(t) = lubgi(t) and since h* (t) is not a function of i, f* (1) = lubfi(t).",
        "Subtract equation 7 from equation 6 and define A(t) = f(i) – f* (t) = gi(t) – g*(t)• (8)",
        "This is just equation 2 in a different notation: g(t) = Li (t) and g* (t) = ubL(t) (specifically lubL(t)) and therefore f1(t) = Ai(t).",
        "Thus, if f* (t) were a constant, Mt) would just be an offset from f(t) and the search would be optimum because argmax (max f(t)) would always be equal to argmax (max fi(t)).",
        "As noted earlier, f* (t) has maxima at word transition times of the correct theory.",
        "Thus f1(t) is zero at word transition times on the correct theory and < 0 for all other i and t. Thus the search is admissible because it can never block the correct theory by giving a better score to an incorrect theory, but suboptimal because it can cause incorrect theories to be popped from the stack and be evaluated.",
        "The evaluation function \"error\" f* (t) - f* (0) is slowly varying and small, therefore the search is near-optimal.",
        "Since the stack decoder treats each theory and all points on the likelihood distribution Li(t)) as a unit, each theory is evaluated at its optimum point: the max Ai (t) as defined in equation 3, to give it its \"best\" chance and then, for efficiency, the likelihood of all points on the distribution Li(t) are extended in one operation.",
        "The fact that all StSci are zero until the first sentence is output and the tie is broken by choosing the theory with the minimum reference time t_min, insures that all candidate theories which might alter lubsai(t < t_minpop) have already been computed.",
        "Thus the lubsfL(t) = lubL(t) for t < t_minpop.",
        "This derivation shows the stack criterion max StSci with a minimum t_mini tiebreaker to be adequate to perform a near-optimal admissible A*-search Viterbi-recognition with non-cross word acoustic models and a no-grammar/unigrarn language-model using the stack decoder algorithm."
