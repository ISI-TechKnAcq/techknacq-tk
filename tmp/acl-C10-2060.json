        "As the rapid development of the Internet, document summarization has become an important task since document collections are growing larger and larger.",
        "Document summarization, which aims at producing a condensed version of the original document(s), helps users to acquire information that is both important and relevant to their information need.",
        "So far, researchers have mainly focused on extractive methods which choose a set of salient textual units to form a summary.",
        "Such textual units are typically sentences, sub-sentences (Gillick and Favre, 2009), or excerpts (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009).",
        "Almost all extractive summarization methods face two key problems: the first problem is how to rank textual units, and the second one is how to select a subset of those ranked units.",
        "The ranking problem requires systems model the relevance of a textual unit to a topic or a query.",
        "In this paper, the ranking problem refers to either sentence ranking or concept ranking.",
        "Concepts can be unigrams, bigrams, semantic content units, etc., although in our experiment, only bigrams are used as concepts.",
        "The selection problem requires systems improve diversity or remove redundancy so that more relevant information can be covered by the summary as its length is limited.",
        "As our paper focuses on extractive summarization, the selection problem refers to selecting sentences.",
        "However, the selection framework presented here is universal for selecting arbitrary textual units, as discussed in Section 4.",
        "There have been a variety of studies to approach the ranking problem.",
        "These include both unsupervised sentence ranking (Luhn, 1958; Radev and Jing, 2004, Erkan and Radev, 2004), and supervised methods (Ouyang et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009).",
        "Even given a list of ranked sentences, it is not trivial to select a subset of sentences to form a good summary which includes diverse information within a length limit.",
        "Three common selection strategies have been studied to address this problem: Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), Diversity Penalty (DiP) (Wan, 2007), and integer linear programming 2009).",
        "As different methods were often evaluated on different datasets, it is of great value to systematically compare ranking and selection strategies on the same dataset.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no work to compare different ranking strategies or compare different selection strategies.",
        "In this paper, we presented a comparative study on the ranking problem and the selection problem for extractive summarization.",
        "We compared three genres of learning-to-rank methods for ranking sentences or concepts: SVR, a pointwise ranking algorithm; RankNet, a pairwise learning-to-rank algorithm; and ListNet, a listwise learning-to-rank algorithm.",
        "We adopted an ILP framework that is able to select sentences based on sentence ranking or concept ranking.",
        "We compared it with other selection strategies such as MMR and Diversity Penalty.",
        "We conducted our comparative experiments on the TAC 2008 and TAC 2009 datasets, respectively.",
        "Our contributions are two-fold: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of presenting systematic and in-depth analysis on comparing ranking strategies and comparing selection strategies.",
        "Second, this is the first work using pairwise and liswise learning-to-rank algorithms to perform concept (word bigram) ranking for extractive summarization.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We introduce the related work in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we present three ranking algorithms,",
        "SVR, RankNet, and ListNet.",
        "We describe the sentence selection problem with an ILP framework described in Section 4.",
        "We introduce features in Section 5.",

        "Recently, graph-based ranking methods have been proposed for sentence ranking and scoring, such as LexRank cea and Tarau, 2004).",

        "Another important issue existing in extractive summarization is to find an optimal sentence subset which can cover diverse information.",
        "Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbo-nell and Goldstein, 1998) and Diversity Penalty (Wan, 2007) are most widely used approaches to reduce redundancy.",

        "Some recent studies (Gillick and Favre, 2009; Martins and Smith, 2009) also modeled sentence selection and compression jointly using ILP.",
        "Our ILP framework proposed here is based on these studies.",
        "Although various selection strategies have been proposed, there is no work to systematically compare these strategies yet.",
        "Learning to rank attracts much attention in the information retrieval community recently.",
        "Pointwise, pairwise and listwise learning-to-rank approaches have been extensively studied (Liu, 2009).",
        "Some of those have been applied to document summarization, such as SVR (Ouyang et al., 2007), classification SVM (Wang et al., 2007), and RankNet (Svore et al., 2007).",
        "Again, there is no work to systematically compare these ranking algorithms.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a listwise learning-to-rank algorithm, ListNet (Cao et al., 2007), is adapted to document summarization in this paper.",
