        "VMP is a record of the number of new vocabulary terms introduced in an interval of text.",

        "The reason is that coherence of a segment should be determined not only by reiteration of words but also by lexical cohesion.",

        "Their method can capture almost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g. systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.",

        "The definition of c(Si) above expresses that c(Si) represents semantic homogeneity of Si, since P(Si) represents the average meaning of w E Si.",
