        "System combination has been shown to improve classification performance in various tasks.",
        "There are several approaches for combining classifiers.",
        "In ensemble learning, a collection of simple classifiers is used to yield better performance than any single classifier; for example boosting (Schapire, 1990).",
        "Another approach is to combine outputs from a few highly specialized classifiers.",
        "The classifiers may be based on the same basic modeling techniques but differ by, for example, alternative feature representations.",
        "Combination of speech recognition outputs is an example of this approach (Fiscus, 1997).",
        "In speech recognition, confusion network decoding (Mangu et al., 2000) has become widely used in system combination.",
        "Unlike speech recognition, current statistical machine translation (MT) systems are based on various different paradigms; for example phrasal, hierarchical and syntax-based systems.",
        "The idea of combining outputs from different MT systems to produce consensus translations in the hope of generating better translations has been around for a while (Fred-erking and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "Recently, confusion network decoding for MT system combination has been proposed (Bangalore et al., 2001).",
        "To generate confusion networks, hypotheses have to be aligned against each other.",
        "In (Bangalore et al., 2001), Lev-enshtein alignment was used to generate the network.",
        "As opposed to speech recognition, the word order between two correct MT outputs may be different and the Levenshtein alignment may not be able to align shifted words in the hypotheses.",
        "In (Matusov et al., 2006), different word orderings are taken into account by training alignment models by considering all hypothesis pairs as a parallel corpus using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The size of the test set may influence the quality of these alignments.",
        "Thus, system outputs from development sets may have to be added to improve the GIZA++ alignments.",
        "A modified Levenshtein alignment allowing shifts as in computation of the translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) was used to align hypotheses in (Sim et al., 2007).",
        "The alignments from TER are consistent as they do not depend on the test set size.",
        "Also, a more heuristic alignment method has been proposed in a different system combination approach (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005).",
        "A full comparison of different alignment methods would be difficult as many approaches require a significant amount of engineering.",
        "Confusion networks are generated by choosing one hypothesis as the \"skeleton\", and other hypotheses are aligned against it.",
        "The skeleton defines the word order of the combination output.",
        "Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) was used to choose the skeleton in (Sim et al., 2007).",
        "The average TER score was computed between each system's 1-best hypothesis and all other hypotheses.",
        "The MBR hypothesis is the one with the minimum average TER and thus, may be viewed as the closest to all other hypotheses in terms of TER.",
        "This work was extended in (Rosti et al., 2007) by introducing system weights for word confidences.",
        "However, the system weights did not influence the skeleton selection, so a hypothesis from a system with zero weight might have been chosen as the skeleton.",
        "In this work, confusion networks are generated by using the best output from each system as the skeleton, and prior probabilities for each network are estimated from the average TER scores between the skeleton and other hypotheses.",
        "All resulting confusion networks are connected in parallel into a joint lattice where the prior probabilities are also multiplied by the system weights.",
        "The combination outputs from confusion network decoding may be ungrammatical due to alignment errors.",
        "Also the word-level decoding may break coherent phrases produced by the individual systems.",
        "In this work, log-posterior probabilities are estimated for each confusion network arc instead of using votes or simple word confidences.",
        "This allows a log-linear addition of arbitrary features such as language model (LM) scores.",
        "The LM scores should increase the total log-posterior of more grammatical hypotheses.",
        "Powell's method (Brent, 1973) is used to tune the system and feature weights simultaneously so as to optimize various automatic evaluation metrics on a development set.",
        "Tuning is fully automatic, as opposed to (Matusov et al., 2006) where global system weights were set manually.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Three evaluation metrics used in weights tuning and reporting the test set results are reviewed in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 describes confusion network decoding for MT system combination.",
        "The extensions to add features log-linearly and improve the skeleton selection are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.",

        "Other evaluation metrics have been proposed to replace BLEU.",
        "It has been argued that METEOR correlates better with human judgment due to higher weight on recall than precision (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "METEOR is based on the weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall measured on unigram matches as follows where is the total number ofunigram matches, is the hypothesis length, is the reference length and is the minimum number of gram matches that covers the alignment.",
        "The second term is a fragmentation penalty which penalizes the harmonic mean by a factor of up to when ; i.e., there are no matching n-grams higher than n = 1.",

        "The METEOR scores are also between and , higher being better.",
        "The scores in the results section are reported as percentages.",
        "Translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) has been proposed as more intuitive evaluation metric since it is based on the rate of edits required to transform the hypothesis into the reference.",
        "The TER score is computed as follows where is the reference length.",
        "The only difference to word error rate is that the TER allows shifts.",
        "A shift of a sequence of words is counted as a single edit.",
        "The minimum translation edit alignment is usually found through a beam search.",
        "When multiple references are provided, the edits from the closest reference are divided by the average reference length.",

        "An improved confusion network decoding method combining the word posteriors with arbitrary features was presented.",
        "This allows the addition of language model scores by expanding the lattices or re-scoring best lists.",
        "The LM integration should result in more grammatical combination outputs.",
        "Also, confusion networks generated by using the best hypothesis from all systems as the skeleton were used with prior probabilities derived from the average TER scores.",
        "This guarantees that the best path will not be found from a network generated for a system with zero weight.",
        "Compared to the earlier system combination approaches, this method is fully automatic and requires very little additional information on top of the development set outputs from the individual systems to tune the weights.",
        "The new method was evaluated on the Arabic to English and Chinese to English NIST MT05 tasks.",
        "Compared to the baseline from (Rosti et al., 2007), the new method improves the BLEU scores significantly.",
        "The combination weights were tuned to optimize three automatic evaluation metrics: TER,",
        "BLEU and METEOR.",
