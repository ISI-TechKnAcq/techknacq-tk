        "Previous work in NLP on sentiment analysis has mainly focused on explicit sentiments.",
        "However, as noted in (Deng and Wiebe, 2014), many opinions are expressed implicitly, as shown by this example: Ex(1) The reform would lower health care costs, which would be a tremendous positive change across the entire health-care system.",
        "There is an explicit positive sentiment toward the event of ?reform lower costs?.",
        "However, in expressing this sentiment, the writer also implies he is negative toward the ?costs?, since he's happy to see the costs being decreased.",
        "Moreover, the writer may be positive toward ?reform?",
        "since it contributes to the ?lower?",
        "event.",
        "Such inferences may be seen as opinion-oriented implicatures (i.e., defeasible inferences) 1 .",
        "We develop a set of rules for inferring and detecting implicit sentiments from explicit sentiments and events such as ?lower?",
        "(Wiebe and Deng, 2014).",
        "In (Deng et al., 2013), we investigate such events, defining a badFor (bf) event to be an event that negatively affects the theme and a goodFor (gf) event to be an event that positively affects the theme of the event.",
        "2 Here, ?lower?",
        "is a bf event.",
        "According to their annotation scheme, goodFor/badFor (gfbf) events have NP agents and themes (though the agent may be implicit), and the polarity of a gf event may be changed to bf by a reverser (and vice versa).",
        "The ultimate goal of this work is to utilize gfbf information to improve detection of the writer's sentiments toward entities mentioned in the text.",
        "However, this requires resolving several ambiguities: (Q1) Given a document, which spans are gfbf events?",
        "(Q2) Given a gfbf text span, what is its polarity, gf or bf?",
        "(Q3) Is the polarity of a gfbf event being reversed?",
        "(Q4) Which NP in the sentence is the agent and which is the theme?",
        "(Q5) What are the writer's sentiments toward the agent and theme, positive or negative?",
        "Fortunately, the implicature rules in (Deng and Wiebe, 2014) define dependencies among these ambiguities.",
        "As in Ex(1), the sentiments toward the agent and theme, the sentiment toward the gfbf event (positive or negative), and the polarity of the gfbf event (gf or bf) are all interdependent.",
        "Thus, rather than having to take a pipeline approach, we are able to develop an optimization framework which exploits these interdependencies to jointly resolve the ambiguities.",
        "Specifically, we develop local detectors to analyze the four individual components of gfbf events, (Q2)-(Q5) above.",
        "Then, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to conduct global This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1 Specifically, we focus on generalized conversational implicature (Grice, 1967; Grice, 1989).",
        "2 Compared to (Deng et al., 2013), we change the term ?object?",
        "to ?theme?",
        "as the later is more appropriate for this task.",
        "79 inference, where the gfbf events and their components are variables and the interdependencies defined by the implicature rules are encoded as constraints over relevant variables in the framework.",
        "The reason we do not address (Q1) is that the gold standard we use for evaluation contains sentiment annotations only toward the agents and themes of gfbf events.",
        "We are only able to evaluate true hits of gfbf events.",
        "Thus, the input to the system is the set of the text spans marked as gfbf events in the corpus.",
        "The results show that, compared to the local detectors, the ILP framework improves sentiment detection by more than 10 points in F-measure and disambiguating gfbf polarity by more than 7 points in the accuracy, without any loss in accuracy for other two components.",
        "2 Related Work Most work in sentiment analysis focuses on classifying explicit sentiments and extracting explicit opinion expressions, holders and targets (Wiebe et al., 2005; Johansson and Moschitti, 2013; Yang and Cardie, 2013).",
        "There is some work investigating features that directly indicate implicit sentiments (Zhang and Liu, 2011; Feng et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, we focus on how we can bridge between explicit and implicit sentiments via inference.",
        "To infer the implicit sentiments related to gfbf events, some work mines various syntactic patterns (Choi and Cardie, 2008), proposes linguistic templates (Zhang and Liu, 2011; Anand and Reschke, 2010; Reschke and Anand, 2011), or generates a lexicon of patient polarity verbs (Goyal et al., 2013).",
        "Different from their work, which do not cover all cases relevant to gfbf events, (Deng and Wiebe, 2014) defines a generalized set of implicature rules and proposes a graph-based model to achieve sentiment propagation between the agents and themes of gfbf events.",
        "However, that system requires all of the gfbf information (Q1)-(Q4) to be input from the manual annotations; the only ambiguity it resolves is sentiments toward entities.",
        "In contrast, the method in this paper tackles four ambiguities simultaneously.",
        "Further, as we will see below in Section 6, the improvement over the local detectors by the current method is greater than that by the previous method, even though it operates over the noisy output of local components automatically.",
        "Different from pipeline architectures, where each step is computed independently, joint inference has often achieved better results.",
        "Roth and Yih (2004) formulate the task of information extraction using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).",
        "Since then, ILP has been widely used in various tasks in NLP, including semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Das et al., 2012), joint extraction of opinion entities and relations (Choi et al., 2006; Yang and Cardie, 2013), co-reference resolution (Denis and Baldridge, 2007), and summarization (Martins and Smith, 2009).",
        "The most similar ILP model to ours is (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), which improves opinion polarity classification using discourse constraints in an ILP model.",
        "However, their work addresses discourse relations among explicit opinions in different sentences.",
        "3 GoodFor/BadFor Event and Implicature This work addresses sentiments toward, in general, states and events which positively or negatively affect entities.",
        "Deng et al. (2013) (hereafter DCW) identify a clear case that occurs frequently in opinion sentences, namely the gfbf events mentioned above.",
        "As defined in DCW, a gf event is an event that positively affects the theme of the event and a bf event is an event that negatively affects the theme.",
        "According to the annotation schema, gfbf events have NP agents and themes (though the agent may be implicit).",
        "In the sentence ?President Obama passed the bill?, the agent of the gf ?passed?",
        "is ?President Obama?",
        "and the theme is ?the bill?.",
        "In the sentence ?The bill was denied?, the agent of the bf ?was denied?",
        "is implicit.",
        "The polarity of a gf event may be changed to bf by a reverser (and vice versa).",
        "For example, in ?The reform will not worsen the economy,?",
        "?not?",
        "is a reverser and it reverses the polarity from bf to gf.",
        "3 The constraints we encode in the ILP framework described below are based on implicature rules in (Deng and Wiebe, 2014).",
        "Table 1 gives two rule schemas, each of which defines four specific rules.",
        "In 3 DCW also introduce retainers.",
        "We don't analyze retainers in this work since they do not affect the polarity of gfbfs, and only 2.5% of gfbfs have retainers in the corpus.",

        "To extract the syntactic agent candidate, we find the nearest noun in front of the gfbf span, and then extract any other word that depends on the noun according to the dependency parse.",

        "To extract the syntactic theme candidate, the same procedure is conducted as for the syntactic agent, but the nearest noun should be after the gfbf.",
        "If there is no A0, A1 or A2, then there is only one agent candidate, implicit and only one theme candidate, null.",
