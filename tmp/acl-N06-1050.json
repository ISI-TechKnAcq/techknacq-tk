        "We present a methodology for creating a test collection of scientific papers that is based on the Cranfield 2 methodology but uses a current conference as the main vehicle for eliciting relevance judgements from users, i.e., the authors.",
        "Building a test collection is a long and expensive process but was necessary as no ready-made test collection existed on which the kinds of experiments with citation information that we envisage could be run.",
        "We aim to improve term-based IR on scientific articles with citation information, by using index terms from the citing article to additionally describe the cited document.",
        "Exactly how to do this is the research question that our test collection should help to address.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 motivates our proposed experiments and, thereby, our test collection.",
        "Section 3 discusses the how test collections are built and, in particular, our own.",
        "Section 4 briefly describes the practicalities of compiling the document collection and the processing we perform to prepare the documents for our experiments.",
        "In Section 5, we show that our test collection can be used with standard IR tools.",
        "Finally, Section 6 discusses the problem of the low number of relevant documents judged so far and two ways of alleviating this problem."

      "heading": "2 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "The idea of using terms external to a document, coming from a ‘citing’ document, has been borrowed from web-based IR.",
        "When one paper cites another, a link is made between them and this link structure is analogous to that of the web: “hyper-links ... provide semantic linkages between objects, much in the same manner that citations link documents to other related documents” (Pitkow and Pirolli, 1997).",
        "Link structure, particularly anchor text, has been used to advantage in web-based IR.",
        "While web pages are often poorly self-descriptive (Brin and Page, 1998) anchor text is often a higher-level description of the pointed-to page.",
        "(Davison,",
        "2000) provides a good discussion of how well anchor text does this and provides experimental results in support.",
        "Thus, beginning with (McBryan, 1994), there is a trend of propagating anchor text along its hyperlink to associate it with the linked page, as well as the page in which it is found.",
        "Google, for example, includes anchor text as index terms for the linked page (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "The TREC Web tracks have also shown that using anchor text improves retrieval effectiveness for some search tasks (Hawking and Craswell, 2005).",
        "This idea has already been applied to citations and scientific articles (Bradshaw, 2003).",
        "In Bradshaw’s experiment, scientific documents are indexed by the text that refers to them in documents that cite them.",
        "However, unlike in experiments with previous collections, we need both the citing and the cited article as full documents in our collection.",
        "The question of how to identify citation ‘anchor text’ and its extent is a matter for research; this requires the full text of the citing article.",
        "Previous experiments and test collections have had only limited access to the content of the citing article: Bradshaw had access only to a fixed window of text around the citation, as provided by CiteSeer’s ‘citation context’; in the GIRT collections (Kluck, 2003), a dozen or so content-bearing information fields (e.g., title, abstract, methodological descriptors) represent each document and the full text is not available.",
        "Additionally, in Bradshaw’s experiment, no access is given to the text of the cited article itself so that the influence of a term-based IR model cannot be studied and so that documents can only be indexed if they have been cited at least once.",
        "A test collection containing full text for many citing and cited documents, thus, has advantages from a methodological point of view."

        "When choosing a scientific field to study, we looked for one that is practicable for us to compile the document collection (freely available machine-readable documents; as few as possible document styles), while still ensuring good coverage of research topics in an entire field.",
        "Had we chosen the medical field or bioinformatics, the prolific number of journals would have been a problem for the practical document preparation.",
        "We also looked for a relatively self-contained field.",
        "As we aim to propagate referential text to cited papers as index terms, references from documents in the collection to other documents within the collection will be most useful.",
        "We call these internal references.",
        "While it is impossible to find or create a collection of documents with only internal references, we aim for as high a proportion of internal references as possible.",
        "We chose the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) Anthology1, a freely available digital archive of computational linguistics research papers.",
        "Computational linguistics is a small, ho-mogenous research field and the Anthology contains the most prominent publications since the beginning of the field in 1960, consists of only 2 journals, 7 conferences and 5 less important publications, such as discontinued conferences and a series of workshops, resulting in only 7000 papers2.",
        "With the ACL Anthology, we expect a high proportion of internal references within a relatively compact document collection.",
        "We empirically measured the proportion of collection-internal references.",
        "We found a proportion of internal references to all references of 0.33 (the in -factor).",
        "We wanted to compare this number to a situation in another, larger field (genetics) but no straightforward comparison is possible, as there are very many genetics journals and quality of journals probably plays a larger role in a bigger field.",
        "We tried to simulate a similar collection to the 9 main jour-nals+conferences in the Anthology, by considering 10 journals in genetics with a range of impact factors3, resulting in an in-factor of 0.17 (dropping to 0.14 if only 5 journals are considered).",
        "Thus, our hypothesis that the Anthology is reasonably self-contained, at least in comparison with other possible collections, was confirmed.",
        "The choice of computational linguistics has the added benefit that we are familiar with the domain; we can interpret the subject matter better than we would be able to in the medical domain.",
        "This should be of use to us in our eventual experiments."

        "The majority were criticisms of the test collection paradigm itself and are not pertinent here.",
        "However, the source-document principle (i.e., the use of queries created from documents in the collection) attracted particular criticisms.",
        "The fundamental concern was that the way in which the queries were created led to “an unnaturally close relation” between the terms in the queries and those used to index the documents in the colection (Vickery, 1967); any such relationship might have created a bias towards a particular indexing language, distorting the comparisons that were the goal of the project.",
        "In Cranfield 1, system success was measured by retrieval of source documents alone, criticized for being an oversimplification and a distortion of ‘real-life’ searching.",
        "The evaluation procedure was changed for Cranfield 2 so that source documents were excluded from searches and, instead, retrieval of other relevant documents was used to measure success.",
        "This removed the problem that, usually, when a user searches, there is no source document for their query.",
        "Despite this, Vickery notes that there were “still verbal links between sought document and question” in the new method: each query author was asked to judge the relevance of the source document’s references and “the questions ... were formulated after the cited papers had been read and has possibly influenced the wording of his question”.",
        "While adapting the Cranfield 2 method to our needs, we have tried to address some of the criticisms, e.g., that authors’ relevance judgements change over time.",
        "Nevertheless, we still have source-document queries and must consider the associated criticisms.",
        "Firstly, our test collection is not intended for comparisons of indexing languages.",
        "Rather, we aim to compare the effect of adding extra index terms to a base indexing of the documents.",
        "The source documents will have no influence on the base indexing of a document above that of the other documents.",
        "The additional index terms, coming from citations to that document, will generally be ‘chosen’ by someone other than the query author, with no knowledge of the query terms 4.",

        "Low numbers do not necessarily preclude our data’s usefulness as a test collection, whose purpose is to facilitate comparative evaluations.",
        "(Voorhees, 1998) states that “To be viable as a laboratory tool, a [test] collection must reliably rank different retrieval variants according to their true effectiveness” and defends the Cranfield paradigm (from criticisms based on relevance subjectivity) by demonstrating that the relative performance of retrieval runs is stable despite differences in relevance judgements.",
        "The underlying principle is that it is not the absolute precision values that matter but the ability to compare these values for different retrieval techniques or systems, to investigate their relative benefits.",
        "A test collection with low precision values will still allow this.",
        "It is known that all evaluation measures are unstable for very small numbers of relevant documents (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000) and there are issues arising from incomplete relevance information in a test collection (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004).",
        "This makes the second stage of our test collection compilation even more indispensable (asking subjects to judge retrieved documents), as this will increase the number of judged relevant documents, as well as bridging the completeness gap.",

        "The bpref measure (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004) gauges retrieval effectiveness solely on the basis of judged documents and is more stable to differing levels of completeness than measures such as MAP, R-precision or precision at fixed document cutoffs.",
