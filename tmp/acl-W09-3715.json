        "Discourse markers are key indicators of discourse structure, and have been shown to be useful devices for (a) segmenting discourse into meaningful units, and (b) identifying relations between these units.",
        "The determination of the meanings of discourse markers is often crucial for understanding the communicated message.",
        "Discourse markers have been studied for their role in the organization of discourse structure in larger texts ([12], [16]), in argumentative dialogues ([6]), in interviews ([15], [10]) and in dialogues that are highly interactive in nature and are characterized by rapid turn switching among participants, such as task-oriented dialogues ([9]) or meeting conversations ([14]).",
        "The research reported in this paper regards the use of discourse markers in spoken dialogue.",
        "In dialogue, discourse markers play an important role in establishing boundaries between dialogue units and in indicating the communicative functions of such units (see e.g. [14], [9], [10]).",
        "(1) Al: it ties you on in terms of the technologies and the complexity that you want",
        "A 2: like for example voice recognition A3: because that you might need to power a microphone and other things A4: so thats one constraint there",
        "In example (1) discourse markers are used by the speaker to indicate the steps in a sequence of arguments: he makes a statement (Inform); then he provides an example for this statement (Inform Exemplify); he justifies his choice (Inform Justification); and he draws a conclusion (Inform Conclude).",
        "An important goal of studies of dialogue structure is to explore possible meanings and functions of discourse markers in dialogue as reflected in observable utterance features (prosodic, syntactic, lexical), to enable their successful recognition and classification.",
        "One aspect of the meaning of discourse markers is that they may not only have a variety of semantic functions, but that they may also have several functions simultaneously - their multifunctionality (see [11], [1], [15] among others).",
        "This paper introduces a formal and systematic, empirically-based approach to the study of the multifunctionality of discourse markers.",
        "We show how the multifunctionality of discourse markers can be described systematically by using a multidimensional model of the interpretation of communicative behaviour in dialogue (Section 2).",
        "Section 3 introduces the analysed data and features.",
        "We illustrate the multifunctionality of discourse markers in some detail for the example of and, as one of the most frequently used and ambiguous dialogue markers.",
        "We provide the results of statistical and machine-learning experiments on the automatic recognizability of discourse marker meanings, and give an overview of the observed multifunctionality of markers that occur in our data (Section 4).",
        "Conclusions and perspectives for further research are outlined in the final Section 5."

      "heading": "2. The notion of multifunctionality",
      "text": [
        "The multifunctionality of discourse markers has been described first by Schiffrin in [15].",
        "She distinguishes between (1) ideational structure, with relations between propositions, e.g. a cohesion relation, a topic relation or a functional relation; (2) action structure, which describes the organisation and constraints on the use of speech acts; (3) exchange structure, which is 'the outcome of decision procedures by which speakers alternate sequential roles and define those alternations in relation to each other'.",
        "Schiffrin argues that discourse markers may simultaneously have roles within each of these three structures, e.g. the discourse marker and may 'coordinate ideas' and 'continue a speaker's action'.",
        "However, the multifunctionality of discourse markers in this study escaped extensive and formal description.",
        "Hovy in [11] states that each discourse marker signals either (1) a 'semantic interpropositional relation', e.g.",
        "CAUSE or PART-OF, or (2) 'interpersonal intentions' (a communicative purpose of an utterance), e.g. to inform someone about a fact, or to instruct someone to do something, or (3) both.",
        "Moreover, according to Hovy each discourse marker 'articulates a rhetorical relation', such as Elaboration or Presentational-Sequence.",
        "Hovy argues that there are several parallel simultaneous structures that underlie coherent discourse and argues that an adequate description of discourse requires at least four distinct structural analyses: semantic, interpersonal/goal-oriented, at-tentional/thematic, and rhetorical.",
        "This approach seems to apply very well to the analysis of the meaning of discourse markers in dialogue.",
        "Discourse markers may have various communicative purposes (also called communicative functions) in dialogue with respect to the underlying task or goal, attention, topic or arguments, turn management, etc.",
        "We only want to add that discourse markers may have various communicative functions simultaneously.",
        "For example, if the speaker wants to provide additional or more detailed information about something that he mentioned before, he can signal the relation between the two pieces of information by using discourse markers such as 'and', 'also', 'moreover'.",
        "The discourse marker signals an elaboration relation and the communicative purpose of the whole utterance, which contains the discourse marker, is Inform with the rhetorical function Elaborate.",
        "Additionally, the discourse marker is used here to show that the speaker wishes to continue in the speaker role (Turn Keep function).",
        "In our analysis by 'multifunctionality' we mean the phenomenon of having multiple meanings simultaneously, which are related to the multiple purposes that an utterance may have in communication.",
        "There are different forms of multifunctionality.",
        "Allwood in [1] claims that if an utterance is multifunctional, 'its multifunctionality can be sequential and simultaneous'.",
        "Bunt in [5] examines this claim using empirical data from several dialogue annotation experiments and concludes that sequential multifunctionality disappears if we take sufficiently fine-grained dialogue units into account (so-called 'functional segments' rather than turns).",
        "A functional segment is defined as 'a smallest(possibly discontinuous) stretch of communicative behaviour that has one or more communicative functions' ([8]).",
        "It was shown in [5] that even if we consider fine-grained units of communicative behaviour we do not get rid of simultaneous multifunctionality; and the minimum number of functions that one segment may have in dialogue is 1.3 on average.",
        "The number of functions grows rapidly if we take forms of multifunctionality into account such as implicated and entailed functions, feedback levels, and indirect functions.",
        "It is noticed in [5] that pragmatically implicated functions, e.g. an expression of thanks also expressing positive feedback, are a true source of multifunctionality.",
        "Logically entailed functions, such as the positive feedback on understanding that is entailed by answering a question or accepting an offer, can also be important.",
        "For the purpose of this study, however, we left such forms of multifunctionality out of consideration.",
        "This has two reasons.",
        "First, we believe that discourse markers as such do not signal any implicated or entailed functions.",
        "Second, since we want to operate on the basis of observable utterance features (prosodic and linguistic) that can be extracted automatically from raw data, to investigate how dialogue participants express and recognise the intended and explicitly indicated multiple functions of dialogue utterances.",
        "In the next section we first describe the relevant aspects of the semantic framework that we will use to study the multiple meanings of discourse markers in dialogue in a systematic fashion."

      "text": [
        "The semantic framework of Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT, [3]) takes a multidimensional view on dialogue, in the sense that it views participation in a dialogue as being engaged in several activities simultaneously, such as trying to advance a task that motivates the dialogue, providing communicative feedback, taking turns, and so on.",
        "Communicative behaviour is interpreted in terms of bundles of update operations on participants' information states (or 'contexts'); such update operations consist of a semantic (referential, propositional, or action-related) content and a communicative function, which specifies what an addressee is supposed to do with the semantic content in order to update his information state [5].",
        "Consider the following dialogue fragment:",
        "(2) Al: that's why i think the option of the kinetic thing",
        "A 2: which basically means as long as you shake it like an automatic watch D2: are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller?",
        "Utterance (Dl) is multifunctional, since it indicates that (1) the speaker wants to have the turn by interrupting the previous speaker (signalled by 'but' overlapping A3); (2) the speaker interpreted and evaluated the utterances Al and A2 successfully; and (3) the speaker encountered a problem in applying the information from the previous utterances (due to the adversative meaning of 'but' ) - he probably does not agree with the previous claim or needs some clarification, which is indeed expressed in D2.",
        "Thus, as the example shows, the various functions of 'but' are related to different 'dimensions' of the interaction [4], such as the allocation of the speaker role and the processing of previous utterances.",
        "In DIT the information which can be addressed is divided into: the domain or task (Task), feedback on the processing of previous utterances by the speaker (Auto-feedback) or by other interlocutors (Allo-feedback), managing difficulties in the speaker's utterance production (Own-Communication Management) or that of other interlocutors (Partner Communication Management), the speaker's need for time to continue the dialogue (Time Management), establishing and maintaining contact (Contact Management), the allocation of the next turn (Turn Management), the way the speaker is planning to structure the dialogue (Dialogue Structuring), and attention for social aspects of the interaction (Social Obligations Management).",
        "It was observed in DIT that some utterances have communicative functions that can be applied to any kind of semantic content (general-purpose (CP) functions).",
        "In particular, they can be applied not only to content information concerning a certain task or domain, but also to information concerning the communication, e.g. an Inform like 'First of all we need to discuss the project finances' is used to introduce a new topic into the discussion.",
        "Dimension-specific (DS) functions, by contrast, are applicable only to information concerned with a specific dimension of communication, e.g. using the utterance 'Let me see' the speaker indicates that he needs some time to do something in preparation of continuing the dialogue (Stalling act).",
        "The phenomenon of general-purpose functions means that, when a stretch of communicative behaviour has a GP function, its full functional characterization requires in addition also the specification of the dimension that is addressed, so we get characterizations like Feedback Question and Task Suggestion.",
        "We found that discourse markers are used (i) as 'preface' of a range of GP functions, in particular Informs of various rhetorical kinds; (ii) as indicators of dialogue acts with a DS function, e.g. of topic shifts; and (iii) as fullblown dialogue acts (without explicit semantic content), e.g. as a Turn Take act.",
        "This means that discourse markers can have two kinds of meanings:",
        "as a dialogue act, i.e. as a context update operator, and as an element that contributes to the determination of the communicative function of a dialogue act with either a GP-or a DS-function.",
        "The DIT framework supports a 'multidimensional' semantics by relating context update operators to different compartments of structured context models which include, besides information states of the usual kind (beliefs and goals related to a task domain), also a dialogue history, information about the agent's processing state, beliefs about dialogue partners' processing states, information and goals concerning the allocation of turns, and so on, relating to the various 'dimensions' that dialogue acts belong to.",
        "The interpretation of a multifunctional stretch of communicative behaviour corresponds to updating the context models of the communicating agents in multiple ways, combining the effects of each of the component functions.",
        "For example:",
        "(3) Bl: what anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls A1:0.4s and you keep losing them",
        "Since it answers B's Set-Question Bl, utterance Al, which includes the discourse marker and, updates the context model of participant B with the information that: (1) A believes that B wants to know which elements of a given set have a given property; (2) A believes that B believes that A knows which elements of that set have that property; (3) A believes to know which elements of that set have that property; and (4) A believes that B made the turn available.",
        "Thus, the simultaneous performance of the turn management and feedback acts through the use of Al, in particular of and, constitutes the multidimensional interpretation of what A says."

        "To summarize we can conclude that discourse markers are truly multifunctional dialogue units.",
        "The analysis of discourse markers as important instruments for the understanding of dialogue and its computational modelling can only benefit from a multidimensional approach to the exploration of their complex meaning.",
        "We showed that discourse markers may simultaneously serve several communicative functions in different dimensions.",
        "They are good indicators of (plentiful) general-purpose communicative functions, such as informs, elaborations of various kinds, suggestions, warnings, disagreements, etc., mostly in relation to the task that underlies the dialogue, but they are also frequently used to create or maintain the conditions for successful interaction (indicating dialogue control acts).",
        "Our investigations showed that discourse markers may have communicative functions in all the dimensions distinguished in DIT, except perhaps in Social Obligations Management.",
        "We noted the importance of discourse markers for segmenting dialogue into meaningful units, since they so to speak bracket functional segments.",
        "Binary automatic classification of DM vs non-DM was successfully performed.",
        "The automatic recognition of the various and multiple communicative functions of discourse markers is even more important.",
        "Our automatic classification experiments showed that machine learning techniques can be profitably used in the automatic recognition of multiple meanings of dialogue markers.",
        "For future work, we intend to extend the studies reported here in two directions.",
        "First, we plan to collect more annotated data containing a richer set of discourse markers and sufficient numbers of instances per class, so that we may increase the accuracy of the classifier for further evaluation of our model on unmarked examples (see [16]).",
        "Furthermore, since AMI meetings are face-to-face interactions and video recordings are available, we plan to consider other modalities besides speech audio, e.g. hand and head gestures, for better understanding of discourse markers functions in support of adequate computational dialogue modelling."
