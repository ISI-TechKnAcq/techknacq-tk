        "e-mail system, search engine, browser, form editor etc.",
        "To detect and correct spelling errors, the state of the art spelling correction systems use the noisy channel approach (Kernighan et al., 1990; Mays et al., 1991; Brill and Moore, 2000).",
        "Its models are usually trained on large corpora and provide high effectiveness in correction of typical errors (most of which consist of 1-2 wrong characters per word), but does not work well for complex (multi- character) and infrequent errors.",
        "In this paper, we improved effectiveness of the noisy channel for the correction of complex errors.",
        "In most cases, these are cognitive errors in loan words (folsvagen ?",
        "volkswa-gen), names of drugs (vobemzin ?",
        "wobenzym), names of brands (scatcher?",
        "skechers), scientific terms (heksagidron?",
        "hexahedron) and last names (Shwartzneger ?",
        "Schwarzenegger).",
        "In all these cases, the misspelled word contains many errors and the corresponding error model penalty cannot be compensated by the LM weight of its proper form.",
        "As a result, either the misspelled word it-self, or the other (less complicated, more frequent) misspelling of the same word wins the likelihood race.",
        "To compensate for this defect of the noisy chan-nel, the iterative approach (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004) is typically used.",
        "The search for the best variant is repeated several times, what allows correcting rather complex errors, but does not completely solve the problem of falling into local minima.",
        "To overcome this issue we suggest to consider more correction hypotheses.",
        "For this purpose we used a method based on the simulated annealing algorithm.",
        "We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers.",
        "Many authors employ machine learning to build rankers that compensate for the drawbacks of the noisy channel model: (Whitelaw et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2010).",
        "These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method.",
        "In our work, we focus on isolated word-error correction (Kukich, 1992), which, in a sense, is a harder task, than multi-word correction, because there is no context available for misspelled words.",
        "For experiments we used single-word queries to a commercial search engine.",
        "2 Baseline speller 2.1 Noisy channel spelling correction Noisy channel is a probabilistic model that defines posterior probability P (q 0 |q 1 ) of q 0 being the intended word, given the observed word q 1 ; for such model, the optimal decision rule ?",

        "Given P (q 0 |q 1 ) defined, to correct the word q 1 we could iterate through 168 all ever-observed words, and choose the one, that maximizes the posterior probability.",
        "However, the practical considerations demand that we do not rank the whole list of words, but instead choose between a limited number of hypotheses h 1 , ..., h K : 1.",
        "Given q 1 , generate a set of hypotheses h 1 , ..., h K , such that K ?",
        "k=1 P (q 0 = h k |q 1 ) ?",
        "1; (2) 2.",
        "Choose the hypothesis h k that maximizes P (q 0 = h k |q 1 ).",
        "If hypotheses constitute a major part of the posterior probability mass, it is highly unlikely that the intended word is not among them.",
        "2.2 Baseline speller setup In baseline speller we use a substring-based error model P dist (q 0 ?",
        "q 1 ) described in (Brill and Moore, 2000), the error model training method and the hypotheses generator are similar to (Duan and Hsu, 2011).",
        "For building language (P LM ? )",
        "and error (P dist ? )",
        "models, we use words collected from the 6-months query log of a commercial search engine.",

        "in 91.8% cases the correct hypothesis is found when K = 30, which confirms the assumption about covering almost all posterior probability mass (see Equation 2).",
        "3 Improvements for noisy channel spelling correction While choosing argmax of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling.",
        "For example, vobemzin is corrected to more frequent misspelling vobenzin (instead of correct form wobenzym) by the noisy channel, because P dist (vobemzin ?",
        "wobenzym) is too low (see Table 1).",
        "There have been attempts (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004) to apply other rules, which would overcome limitations of language and error models with compensating changes described further.",

        "It is motivated by the assump-tion, that we are more likely to successfully correct the query if we take several short steps instead of one big step (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004) .",
        "Iterative correction is hill climbing in the space of possible corrections: on each iteration we make a transition to the best point in the neighbourhood, i.e. to correction, that has maximal posterior probability P (c|q).",
        "As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word.",
        "3.2 Stochastic iterative correction A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task.",
        "In this section we propose such an adaptation.",
        "Consider: we do not always transition deterministically to the next best correction, but instead transition randomly to a (potentially any) correction with transition probability being equal to the posterior P (c i |c i?1 ), where c i?1 is the correction we transition from, c i is the correction we transition to, and P (?|?)",
        "is defined by Equation 1.",
        "Iterative correction then turns into a random walk: we start at word c 0 = q and stop after E random steps at some word c E , which becomes our answer.",
        "To turn random walk into deterministic spelling correction algorithm, we de-randomize it, using the following transformation.",
        "Described random walk defines, for each word w, a probability P (c E = w|q) of ending up in w after starting a walk from the initial query q.",
        "With that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following: given query q, pick c = argmax c E P (c E |q) as a correction.",

        "Example: if we start a random walk from vobemzin and make 3 steps, we most probably will end up in the correct form wobenzym with P = 0.361.",
        "A few of the most probable random walk paths are shown in Table 2.",
        "Note, that despite the fact that most probable path does not lead to the correct word, many other paths to wobenzym sum up to 0.361, which is greater than probability of any other word.",

        "We have also found, that resulting posterior probabilities emphasize the best hypothesis too much: best hypothesis gets almost all probability mass and other hypotheses get none.",
