      "text": [
        "DELPH-IN (Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG) is a repository of open-source software and linguistic resources for so-called 'deep' grammatical analysis.",
        "The grammars are rooted in relatively detailed, hand-coded linguistic knowledge – including lexical argument structure and the linking of syntactic functions to thematic arguments – and are intended as general-purpose resources, applicable to both parsing and generation.",
        "Semantics in DELPH-IN is cast in the Minimal Recursion Semantics framework (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Pollard, & Sag, 2005), essentially predicate - argument structures with provision for underspecified scopal relations.",
        "For the 2009 'open' task, we used the DELPH-IN grammars for English (ERG; Flickinger, 2000), German (GG; Crysmann, 2005), Japanese (JaCY; Siegel & Bender, 2002), and Spanish (SRG; Marimon, Bel, & Seghezzi, 2007).",
        "The grammars vary in their stage of development: the ERG comprises some 15 years of continuous development, whereas work on the SRG only started about five years ago, with GG and JaCY ranging somewhere inbetween.",
        "We applied the DELPH-IN grammars to the CoNLL data using the PET parser (Callmeier, 2002) running it through the [incr tsdb()] environment (Oepen & Carroll, 2000), for parallelization and distribution.",
        "Also, [incr tsdb()] provides facilities for (re-)training the MaxEnt parse selection models that PET uses for disambiguation.",
        "The two main challenges in applying DELPHIN resources to parsing CoNLL data were (a) mismatches in basic assumptions, specifically tokenization and the inventory of PoS tags provided as part of the input, and (b) the need to adapt the resources for new domains and genres – in particular in terms of parse disambiguation – as the English and Spanish grammars at least had not been previously applied to the corpora used in the CoNLL shared task.",
        "The importance of the first of these two aspects is often underestimated.",
        "A detailed computational grammar, inevitably, comes with its own assumptions about tokenization – the ERG, for example, rejects the conventional assumptions underlying the PTB (and derived tools).",
        "It opts for an analysis of punctuation akin to affixation (rather than as standalone tokens), does not break up contracted negated auxiliaries, and splits hyphenated words like ill-advised into two tokens (the hyphen being part of the first component).",
        "Thus, a string like Don't you!",
        "in the CoNLL data is tokenized as the four-element sequence (do, n't,you, !",
        "), whereas the ERG analysis has only two leaf nodes: (don't, you!",
        ").",
        "Fortunately, the DELPH-IN toolchain recently incorporated a mechanism called chart mapping (Adolphs et al., 2008), which allows one to map flexibly from 'external' input to grammar-internal assumptions, while keeping track of external token identities and their contributions to the final analysis.",
        "The February 2009 release of the ERG already had this machinery in place (with the goal of supporting extant, PTB-trained PoS taggers in preprocessing input to the deep parser), and we found that only a tiny number of additional chart mapping rules was required to 'fix up' CoNLL-specific deviations from the PTB tradition.",
        "With the help of the original developers, we created new chart mapping configurations for the German and Japanese grammars (with 17 and 16 such accomodation rules, respectively) in a similar spirit.",
        "All four DELPH-IN grammars in-",
        "MST Parser",
        "elude an account of unknown words, based on underspecified 'generic' lexical entries that are activated from PoS information.",
        "The Japenese case was interesting, in that the grammar assumes a different preprocessor (ChaSen, rather than Juman), such that not only token boundaries but also PoS tags and morphological features had to be mapped.",
        "From our limited experience to date, we found the chart mapping approach adequate in accomodating such discrepancies, and the addition of this extra layer of input processing gave substantial gains in parser coverage (see below).",
        "For the Spanish data, on the other hand, we found it impossible to make effective use of the PoS and morphological information in the CoNLL data, due to more fundamental discrepancies (e.g. the treatment of enclitics and multi-word expressions).",
        "The ERG includes a domain-specific parse selection model (for tourism instructions); GG only a stub model trained on a handful of test sentences.",
        "For use on the CoNLL data, thus, we had to train new parse selections models, better adapted to the shared task corpora.",
        "Disambiguation in PET is realized by conditional MaxEnt models (Toutanova, Manning, Flickinger, & Oepen, 2005), usually trained on full HPSG treebanks.",
        "Lacking this kind of training material, we utilized the CoNLL dependency information instead, by defining an unlabeled dependency accuracy (DA) metric for HPSG analyses, essentially quantifying the degree of overlap in head-dependent relations against the CoNLL annotations.",
        "Calculating DA for HPSG trees is similar to the procedure commonly used for extracting bi-lexical dependencies from phrase structure trees, in a sense even simpler as HPSG analyses fully determine headeness.",
        "Taking into account the technical complication of token-level mismatches, our DA metric loosely corresponds to the unlabeled attachment score.",
        "To train CoNLL-speciic parse selection models, we parsed the development sections in 500-best mode (using the existing models) and then mechanically 'annotated' the HPSG analyses with maximum DA as preferred, all others as dis-preferred.",
        "In other words, this procedure constructs a 'binarized' empirical distribution where estimation of log-linear model parameters amounts to adjusting conditional probabilities towards higher DA values.",
        "Using the [incr tsdb()] MaxEnt experimentation facilities, we trained new parse selection models for English and German, using the first 16,000 sentences of the English training data and the full German training corpus; seeing that only inputs that (a) parse successfully and (b) have multiple readings, with distinct DA values are relevant to this step, the final models reflect close to 13,000 sentences for English, and a little more than 4,000 items for German.",
        "Much like in the SRL component, these experiments are carried out with the tadm software, using tenfold cross-validation and exact match ranking accuracy (against the binarized training distribution) to optimize estimation hyper-parameters",
        "HPSG parsing coverage and average cpu time per input for the four languages with DELPH-IN grammars are summarized in Table 1.",
        "The PoS-based unknown word mechanism was active for all grammars but no other robustness measures (which tend to lower the quality of results) were used, i.e. only complete spanning HPSG analyses were accepted.",
        "Parse times are for 1-best parsing, using selective unpacking (Zhang, Oepen, & Carroll, 2007).",
        "HPSG parsing outputs are available in several different forms.",
        "We investigated two types of structures: syntactic derivations and MRS meaningrep-resentations.",
