        "The goal of Information Retrieval (IR) is finding answer suited to user question from massive document collections with satisfied response time.",
        "With the exponential growth of information on the Web, user is expecting to find answer more fast with less effort.",
        "Current IR systems especially focus on improving precision the result rather than recall.",
        "A notable trend in IR is to provide more accurate, immediately usable information as in Question Answering systems(Q/A) [1] or in some systems using pre-constructed question/answer document pairs [2, 3], known “answer set driven” system.",
        "While traditional search engine uses term indexing, i.e. tf*idf, answer approaches use syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge provided expert, i.e. WordNet[4].",
        "Another difference comes from the fact that answer approach returns “answer set” distilled information need of user as retrieval result, not just document appeared query terms.",
        "The TREC Q/A track [1, 5, 6] which has motivated much of the recent work in the field focuses on fact-based, short-answer question type, e.g. “Who is Barbara Jordan?” or “What is Mardi Gras?.",
        "The Q/A runs find an actual answer in TREC collection, rather than a ranked list of documents, in response to a question.",
        "On the other hand, user queries in answer set driven system, like AskJeeves[2], are more implicit and conceptual.",
        "These system was developed targeting the Web [7, 8], is larger than the TREC Q/A document collection.",
        "Whereas the user gives incomplete query to system, they need not only answers but related information.",
        "Sometimes the user even has uncertainty what exactly they need.",
        "For example, the user query just “Paris” is answered by gathering information including Paris city guide, photographs of Paris, and so on.",
        "To catch information need of user, these system have predefined query pattern and prepared correct answers belonging to each question.",
        "Since it is still considered difficult, if not impossible, to capture semantics and pragmatics of sentences in user queries and documents, such systems require knowledge bases built manually so that a certain level of quality can be guaranteed.",
        "Needless to say, this knowledge base construction process is labor-intensive, typically requiring significant and continuous human efforts [9].",
        "This paper rests on the both directions: a new type of IR and its operational experience.",
        "Our system, named “AnyQ”1, attempts to provide high quality answer documents to user queries by maintaining a knowledge base consisting of expected queries and corresponding answer document.",
        "We defined the semantic category of the answer as attributes and the",
        "documents associated with each attributes as answer set.",
        "In order to reduce the cost of manually constructing and maintaining answer sets, we have devised a new method of automating the answer document selection process by using the automatic text categorization, reported ABC(Attribute-Based Classification) [ 10].",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents overviews of our answer set driven retrieval system and knowledge base.",
        "In Section 3 and 4 elaborates on answer set construction and its retrieval process.",
        "Section 5 details experiment results for our method.",
        "After discussing the limitations of our approach in Section 6, we conclude by summarizing our contributions and describing future works."

        "The goal of these systems is to explore how does map user question into answer document that might be contain pertinent information.",
        "In these systems, it is crucial to devise a method to construct a high-quality knowledge base.",
        "In our system, we take a hybrid approach of using a human-generated concept hierarchy and automatic classification techniques to make it more feasible to build an operational system.",
        "Our system analyzes a user query to extract concept and attribute terms that can be matched against the knowledge base where a set of answer documents can be found.",
        "As such, it has three parts: answer set construction, answer set search, answer presentation, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The answer set construction part, which is seemed indexing part in traditional IR system, employees both manual and automatic methods to build the knowledge base.",
        "The answer set search part processes a natural language query, extracts concepts and attributes, and maps them to the knowledge base so that the answer documents associated with the <concept, attribute> pairs can be retrieve.",

      "text": [
        "Our knowledge base consists of three parts: a concept network, attributes associated with each concept, and answer set belonging to each <concept, attribute> pair.",
        "The concept network contains about 50,000 conceptual word2 as in WordNet [11] with 6 lexico-semantic relations that are used to form a synset hierarchy.",
        "By using the concept network, as already well-know in the WordNet-related research [1, 4, 6], a semantic processing of questions becomes possible.",
        "The information mined from concept network guides process of bridging inference between the query and the expected answer.",
        "Finding a place, i.e. concept node, in the network for a query can be construed as understanding the meaning of the query.",
        "Attribute set an intermediary as connecting concept network with 2 Include 14,700 conceptual word in economy domain answer documents.",
        "The answer-set driven retrieval system maps a user query into one or more concepts and further down to one or more attributes where associated documents can be picked up as the answer set.",
        "Attributes play the role in subcategorizing the documents belonging to the concept node.",
        "A set of attributes chosen for a particular concept specifies various aspects often mentioned in the documents bearing the concept and serves as an intermediary between a concept and high-precision answer documents.",
        "It should be noted that attributes are not inherently associated with a concept, but found in the documents addressing the concept.",
        "For instance, as in Figure 2, the concept node for “angel investment” would have attributes, “definition”, “strategy”, “prospects” and “merits”, that are aspects or characteristics of “angel investment” often mentioned in relevant documents.",
        "Figure 2 and table 1 represent groups of concepts from different levels of the concept network and the distribution of attributes, showing that some attributes are shared by some concepts while others are unique to a concept.",
        "The fact that some attributes are shared by all or most of the concepts belonging to a higher level concept allow us to assume that related concepts share the same set of attributes.",
        "Another assumption we employ is that because of the observation that attributes tend to be found in the neighborhoods of some concept, the training data for a particular attribute under a given concept can be used for the same attribute under another concept.",
        "With these assumptions, we devised a method of minimizing the training data construction efforts required for attribute-based classification, which is essential to select documents to be associated with <concept, attribute> pairs.",
        "In order to reuse the training data constructed for a particular <concept, attribute> pair, we define a-relation between two concepts.",
        "Two concepts are said to have an a-relation when the sets of associated attributes are sufficiently similar to each other.",

        "Attributes are defined to exist for concepts corresponding to categories in subject-based classification.",
        "Documents classified to a concept are considered to possess one or more attributes that reveal some characteristics or aspects of a document.",
        "Considering attributes as a different type of categories, we can define an attribute-based classifier for documents.",
        "While we employ the same learning-based and rule-based classification techniques for attribute-based classification, we underscore the way it is used for automatic knowledge-base construction, together with traditional subject-based classification.",
        "It works on reducing human efforts dramatically to knowledge base construction.",
        "Our attribute-based classification method [10], at least as it is now, is no different from traditional text classification methods in that it uses training documents.",
        "However, the task of knowledge base construction for the answer set based retrieval system calls for unusual requirements.",
        "Whereas categories are pretty much fixed in traditional classification systems, the number of attributes (i.e. categories) for a given concept may change in our context.",
        "Another difference comes from the fact that it is not easy to have a sufficient number of training documents for each category since there are so many <concept, attribute> pairs that correspond to categories.",
        "In order to address the issues mentioned above, we decided to add two additional steps to the ordinary statistical classification: - use of pattern rules in conjunction with the usual learning-based classification - selective use of words that may not be specific for attributes - use of a-relation While the first and second were chosen to improve precision of the classifier, the third was devised to widen the coverage of <concept, attribute> pairs for which training documents are provided.",
        "In other words, the use of a-relation allow us to reuse a classifier learned from a set of training documents belonging to a concept for the same attribute class under a different concept.",
        "To improve upon accuracy of our attribute-based classifier, we have employed both rule-based and learning-based approaches.",
        "Unlink the case of subject-based classification, attribute class boundaries are sometimes hard to detect if only words are used as features.",
        "As such, we decided to use patterns of word sequences, not just single words.",
        "We have defined rules from train documents, which express the characteristics of a given attribute class.",
        "Rules may include single words, phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs.",
        "The pattern rules3 are used to complement the errors made by the machine learning method, and further it is reused in query processing.",
        "We take the approach of a hybrid system combining rule-based classification and learning-based classification, with different weights are applied to different attributes.",
        "Besides we detect that some terms are not good at discriminate attribute since they are too specific to concept, whereas these terms are helpful to classify in concept.",
        "Therefore we eliminate the terms that concept-dependent word which frequently appearing in a certain concept area.",
        "Another challenging problem in an operational setting is to define useful attributes to each of the concept nodes and collect training documents for each attribute under a concept node.",
        "It would be too expensive and time-consuming to collect a sufficient number of training documents for all the classes represented by <concept, attribute> pairs.",
        "Currently the number of classes is more than 250,0004.",
        "We need a method by which we can assign an attribute to a new document without separate training documents for that particular <concept, attribute> pair.",
        "Our approach to this problem is to use a special kind of relation, named a-relation, defined over the concepts",
        "in the network.",
        "The main idea is to build a classifier for only one concept among the many belonging to an equivalence class based on the a-relation, and use it for other concepts.",
        "That is, we only need training documents for the representative class.",
        "Table 1 shows a distribution of attributes among the concept in a-relation.",
        "Once the attributes are identified for the first two concepts, “Incentives” and “Hourly wage”, and training documents are selected for them, all the attributes except for the last one, “negotiation”, can be considered having training documents.",
        "If we define attributes up to the third concept, “Basic salary”, all the attributes are covered.",
        "The classifier learned from a single set of documents belonging to the concept would have the capability of classifying documents to the attribute classes belonging to other concepts if the concepts are all a-related.",
        "We first construct a training document set5 only for a single concept node representing all those nodes with the same attributes, using meta-search engine and document clustering.",
        "So we can build a classifier for those attributes that manifest themselves in the training set.",
        "If some documents fail to be assigned to an attribute, they are assigned to one of the remaining attributes.",
        "If a concept node other than the representative node in the equivalence class needs a. new attribute, we simply look for training documents for that attribute only.",
        "This kind of incremental process is based on our assumption that although attributes are associated with individual concept nodes, they share the common characteristics regardless of their parent concept nodes.",
        "Undoubtedly, however, this assumption does not always hold."
