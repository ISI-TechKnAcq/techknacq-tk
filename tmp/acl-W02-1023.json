        "However, the predicate structure of the sentence emphasizes the rescuers, and this particular image was labeled as a member of the Workers Responding category, although you can also see wreckage and a victim within the image.",
        "On the other hand, consider an image with a different caption, reading \"A fire victim who perished in a blaze at a Manila disco is carried by Philippine rescuers.\" This caption suggests a focus on the victim as opposed to the rescuers, which implies that the image would be more appropriate for the Affected People category.",
        "However, the words in the caption are nearly identical.",
        "A typical bag of words approach does not have the capacity to distinguish between this hypothetical image and the example shown; each word is either present a certain number of times or it is not, and there is no way to capture predicate structure.",
        "For certain tasks involving categories such as the ones we are dealing with here, some linguistic analysis is necessary.",
        "No preexisting system that we tested was able to perform well on these categories.",
        "We eventually became convinced that the main subject and verb of the first sentence of the caption are particularly important in determining the category of an image.'",
        "These words correspond to the object in the image and to what that object is doing.",
        "For example, the most helpful words in the caption of the image shown in Figure 1 are \"rescuers\" and \"carry\".",

        "In previous research, human evaluators labeled those news documents which contain images into the categories Disaster, Struggle, Politics, Crime, and Other.",
        "For the experiments discussed in this paper, we started with the 296 images embedded in Disaster documents.",
        "We chose the Disaster category, approximately defined to cover natural disasters and accidents, because our previous system achieves almost perfect precision and recall for this category.",
        "We defined four categories to apply to these images: Workers Responding, Affected People, Wreckage, and Other.",
        "The categories were defined to be mutually exclusive, and for images that seemed to fit into multiple categories, we asked human evaluators to choose the best fit based on the main focus of the image.2 Each image was categorized by the first author of this paper and one volunteer who were shown both the image and the caption, and those with agreement were used for the experiments discussed in this paper.",
        "There was agreement for 248 images.",
        "98 (39.5%) were classified as Workers Responding, 72 (29.0%) were classified as Affected People, 55 (22.2%) were classified as Wreckage, and 23 (9.3%) were classified as Other.",

        "A web interface was set up which allows volunteers to predict each categories of images.",
        "Each volunteer was tested with a different condition for each of the four subsets of our data, and each subset was presented to our four volunteers with the four different conditions.",

        "All volunteers performed much better when shown the full first sentence with words in their original order than when the same words were shown in random order, and the task took approximately half the time.",
        "Therefore, any bag of words approach is likely limited by a significantly lower upper bound than one which uses NLP techniques.",
        "In particular, the main subject and verb from the sentence were important.",
        "Given only these two words, volunteers performed almost as well as when they had all the words in random order, and much better than when they were given the top two words according to TF*IDF weights, a very common measure of word importance in IR literature.",
