        "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), in which the aim is to convert the orthography of a word to its pronunciation (phonetic transcription), plays an important role in speech synthesis and understanding.",
        "Names, which comprise over 75% of unseen words (Black et al., 1998), present a particular challenge to G2P systems because of their high pronunciation variability.",
        "Guessing the correct pronunciation of a name is often difficult, especially if they are of foreign origin; this is attested by the ad hoc transcriptions which sometimes accompany new names introduced in news articles, especially for international stories with many foreign names.",
        "Transliterations provide a way of disambiguating the pronunciation of names.",
        "They are more abundant than phonetic transcriptions, for example when news items of international or global significance are reported in multiple languages.",
        "In addition, writing scripts such as Arabic, Korean, or Hindi are more consistent and easier to identify than various phonetic transcription schemes.",
        "The process of transliteration, also called phonetic translation (Li et al., 2009b), involves \"sounding out\" a name and then finding the closest possible representation of the sounds in another writing script.",
        "Thus, the correct pronunciation of a name is partially encoded in the form of the transliteration.",
        "For example, given the ambiguous letter-to-phoneme mapping of the English letter g, the initial phoneme of the name Gershwin may be predicted by a G2P system to be either /g/ (as in Gertrude) or /&,/ (as in Gerald).",
        "The transliterations of the name in other scripts provide support for the former (correct) alternative.",
        "Although it seems evident that transliterations should be helpful in determining the correct pronunciation of a name, designing a system that takes advantage of this insight is not trivial.",
        "The main source of the difficulty stems from the differences between the phonologies of distinct languages.",
        "The mappings between phonemic inventories are often complex and context-dependent.",
        "For example, because Hindi has no /w/ sound, the transliteration of Gershwin instead uses a symbol that represents the phoneme /v/, similar to the /v/ phoneme in English.",
        "In addition, converting transliterations into phonemes is often non-trivial; although few orthographies are as inconsistent as that of English, this is effectively the G2P task for the particular language in question.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that leveraging transliterations can, in fact, improve the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of names.",
        "We propose a novel system based on discriminative re-ranking that is capable of incorporating multiple transliterations.",
        "We show that simplistic approaches to the problem fail to achieve the same goal, and that transliterations from multiple languages are more helpful than from a single language.",
        "Our approach can be combined with any G2P system that produces n-best lists instead of single outputs.",
        "The experiments that we perform demonstrate significant error reduction for three very different G2P base systems."

        "In both G2P and machine transliteration, we are interested in learning a function that, given an input sequence x, produces an output sequence y.",
        "In the G2P task, x is composed of graphemes and y is composed of phonemes; in transliteration, both sequences consist of graphemes but they represent different writing scripts.",
        "Unlike in machine translation, the monotonicity constraint is enforced; i.e., we assume that x and y can be aligned without the alignment links crossing each other (Jiampojamarn and Kondrak, 2010).",
        "We assume that we have available a base G2P system that produces an n-best list of outputs with a corresponding list of confidence scores.",
        "The goal is to improve the base system's performance by applying existing transliterations of the input x to re-rank the system's n-best output list.",
        "A simple and intuitive approach to improving G2P with transliterations is to select from the n-best list the output sequence that is most similar to the corresponding transliteration.",
        "For example, the Hindi transliteration in Figure 1 is arguably closest in perceptual terms to the phonetic transcription of the second output in the n-best list, as compared to the other outputs.",
        "One obvious problem with this method is that it ignores the relative ordering of the n-best lists and their corresponding scores produced by the base system.",
        "A better approach is to combine the similarity score with the output score from the base system, allowing it to contribute an estimate of confidence in its output.",
        "For this purpose, we apply a linear combination of the two scores, where a single parameter A, ranging between zero and one, determines the relative weight of the scores.",
        "The exact value of A can be optimized on a training set.",
        "This approach is similar to the method used by Finch and Sumita (2010) to combine the scores of two different machine transliteration systems.",
        "The approaches presented in the previous section crucially depend on a method for computing the similarity between various symbol sequences that represent the same word.",
        "If we have a method of converting transliterations to phonetic representations, the similarity between two sequences of phonemes can be computed with a simple method such as normalized edit distance or the longest common subsequence ratio, which take into account the number and position of identical phonemes.",
        "Alternatively, we could apply a more complex approach, such as ALINE (Kondrak, 2000), which computes the distance between pairs of phonemes.",
        "However, the implementation of a conversion program would require ample training data or language-specific expertise.",
        "A more general approach is to skip the transcription step and compute the similarity between phonemes and graphemes directly.",
        "For example, the edit distance function can be learned from a training set of transliterations and their phonetic transcriptions (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we apply M2M-Aligner (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007), an unsupervised aligner, which is a many-to-many generalization of the learned edit distance algorithm.",
        "M2M-Aligner was originally designed to align graphemes and phonemes, but can be applied to discover the alignment between any sets of symbols (given training data).",
        "The logarithm of the probability assigned to the optimal alignment can then be interpreted as a similarity measure between the two sequences.",
        "The methods described in Section 2.2, which are based on the similarity between outputs and transliterations, are difficult to generalize when multiple transliterations of a single name are available.",
        "A linear combination is still possible but in this case optimizing the parameters would no longer be straightforward.",

        "Since the n-gram features are also applied to transliteration-transcription pairs, the reverse features enable us to include features which bind a variety of n-grams in the transliteration string with a single corresponding phoneme.",
        "The construction of n-gram features presupposes a fixed alignment between the input and output sequences.",
        "If the base G2P system does not provide input-output alignments, we use M2M-Aligner for this purpose.",

        "A closer look at the results provides additional insight into the operation of our re-ranking system.",
        "For example, consider the name Bacchus, which Di-recTL+ incorrectly converts into /bœktjas/.",
        "The most likely reason why our re-ranker selects instead the correct pronunciation /bœkas/ is that M2M-Aligner fails to align three of the five available transliterations with /bœktjas/.",
        "Such alignment failures are caused by a lack of evidence for the mapping of the grapheme representing the sound /k/ in the transliteration training data with the phoneme /tj/.",
        "In addition, the lack of alignments prevents any n-gram features from being enabled.",
        "Considering the difficulty of the task, the top accuracy of almost 75% is quite impressive.",
        "In fact, many instances of human transliterations in our corpora are clearly incorrect.",
        "For example, the Hindi transliteration of Bacchus contains the /t/ consonant instead of the correct /k/.",
        "Moreover, our strict evaluation based on word accuracy counts all system outputs that fail to exactly match the dictionary data as errors.",
        "The differences are often very minor and may reflect an alternative pronunciation.",
        "The phoneme accuracy of our best result is 93.1%,",
        "Table 4: Absolute improvement in word accuracy (%) over the base system (DirecTL+) of the SVM re-ranker for various numbers of available transliterations.",
        "which provides some idea of how similar the predicted pronunciation is to the correct one.",
        "One motivating factor for the use of SVM re-ranking was the ability to incorporate multiple transliteration languages.",
        "But how important is it to use more than one language?",
        "To examine this question, we look particularly at the sets of names having at most k transliterations available.",
        "Table 4 shows the results with DirecTL+ as the base system.",
        "Note that the number of names with more than five transliterations was small.",
        "Importantly, we see that the increase in performance when only one transliteration is available is so small as to be insignificant.",
        "From this, we can conclude that obtaining improvement on the basis of a single transliteration is difficult in general.",
        "This corroborates the results of the experiment described in Section 3.3, where we used only Hindi transliterations."

        "In addition, the P2P approach works only on single outputs, whereas our re-ranking approach is designed to handle n-best output lists.",

        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), methods that incorporate translations from other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) have proven effective in low-resource situations: when phrase translations are unavailable for a certain language, one can look at other languages where the translation is available and then translate from that language.",
        "A similar pivoting approach has also been applied to machine transliteration (Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "Notably, the focus of these works have been on cases in which there are less data available; they also modify the generation process directly, rather than operating on existing outputs as we do.",
        "Ultimately, a combination of the two approaches is likely to give the best results.",
        "Finch and Sumita (2010) combine two very different approaches to transliteration using simple linear interpolation: they use Sequitur's n-best outputs and re-rank them using a linear combination of the original Sequitur score and the score for that output of a phrased-based SMT system.",
        "The linear weights are hand-tuned.",
        "We similarly use linear combinations, but with many more scores and other features, necessitating the use ofSVMs to determine the weights.",

        "In this paper, we explored the application of transliterations to G2P.",
        "We demonstrated that transliterations have the potential for helping choose between n-best output lists provided by standard G2P systems.",
        "Simple approaches based solely on similarity do not work when tested using a single transliteration language (Hindi), necessitating the use of smarter methods that can incorporate multiple transliteration languages.",
        "We apply SVM re-ranking to this task, enabling us to use a variety of features based not only on similarity scores but on n-grams as well.",
        "Our method shows impressive error reductions over the popular Festival system and the generative joint n-gram Sequitur system.",
        "We also find significant error reduction using the state-of-the-art DirecTL+ system.",
        "Our analysis demonstrated that it is essential to provide the re-ranking system with transliterations from multiple languages in order to mitigate the differences between phonological inventories and smooth out noise in the transliterations.",
        "In the future, we plan to generalize our approach so that it can be applied to the task of generating transliterations, and to combine data from distinct G2P dictionaries.",
        "The latter task is related to the notion of domain adaptation.",
        "We would also like to apply our approach to web data; we have shown that it is possible to use noisy transliteration data, so it may be possible to leverage the noisy ad hoc pronunciation data as well.",
        "Finally, we plan to investigate earlier integration of such external information into the G2P process for single systems; while we noted that re-ranking provides a general approach applicable to any system that can generate n-best lists, there is a limit as to what re-ranking can do, as it relies on the correct output existing in the n-best list.",
        "Modifying existing systems would provide greater potential for improving results even though the changes would be necessarily system-specific."
