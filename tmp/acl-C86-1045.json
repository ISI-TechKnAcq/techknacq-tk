        "One of the two combined constituents, the functor, encodes the combination funtion, the other constituent serves as the argument to this function.",
        "Instead of phrase structure rules, the grammar contains one or, in some formalisms, two combination rules that combine a functor and an argument by applying the function encoded in the functor to the argument constituent.",

        "The graph notation expresses the relation between argument and value categories quite well; it is expressed in a set of bindings between subgraphs of the two categories.",
        "In the context of this discussion, some remarks are in order on the specific role PATR has played for the experiments with CUG s. The philosophy behind the development of PATR has been to provide a tool for writing, testing, and comparing grammars of very different types in a powerful formalism with well-understood formal properties and a well-defined semantics (Shieber 1984).",
        "Thus PATR could be useful for writing grammars, designing grammar formalisms, and for exploring classes of such formalisms.",
        "The work on exploring categorial unification formalisms has not only benefitted from the features of PATR but it has in a way also influenced the development of the PATR formalism.",
        "It was, for instance, essential for the writing of categorial grammars to allow category variables in the context-free phrase structure part of the rules.",
