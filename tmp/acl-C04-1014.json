        "Language modeling is the attempt to characterize, capture and exploit the regularities and constraints in a natural language and has been successfully applied to many domains.",
        "Among all the language modeling approaches, ngram models have been most widely used in speech recognition (Jelinek 1990; Gale and Church 1990; Brown et al.",
        "1992; Yang et al.",
        "1996) and other applications.",
        "While ngram models are simple in language modeling and have been successfully used in speech recognition and other tasks, they have obvious deficiencies.",
        "For instance, ngram models can only capture the short-distance dependency within an n-words window where currently the largest practical N for a natural language is three.",
        "In the meantime, it is found that there always exist many preferred relationships between words.",
        "Two highly associated word pairs are “not only/but also” and “doctor/nurse”.",
        "Psychological experiments in Meyer D. et al.",
        "(1975) indicated that the human’s reaction to a highly associated word pair was stronger and faster than that to a poorly associated word pair.",
        "Such preference information is very useful for natural language processing (Church K.W.",
        "et al.",
        "1990; Hiddle D. et al.",
        "1993; Rosenfeld R. 1994 and Zhou G.D. et al.1998).",
        "Obviously, the preference relationships between words can expand from a short to long distance.",
        "While we can use conventional ngram models to capture the short distance dependency, the long distance dependency should also be exploited properly.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to propose a new modeling approach to capture the context dependency over both a short distance and a long distance and apply it in Mandarin speech recognition.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present the normal ngram modeling while a new modeling approach, named MI-ngram modeling, is proposed in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we will describe its use in our Mandarin speech recognition system.",
        "Finally we give a summary of this paper."

        "So, the classical task of statistical language modeling becomes how to effectively and efficiently predict the next word, given the previous words, that is to say, to estimate expressions of the form P(wi I wi-1) .",
        "For convenience, P(wi I wi-1) is often written as P(wi |h) , where h = w;−1, is called history.",
        "Traditionally, simple statistical models, known as ngram models, have been widely used in speech recognition.",
        "Within an ngram model, the probability of a word occurring next is estimated based on the n – 1 previous words.",
        "That is to say,",
        "For example, in bigram model (n=2) the probability of a word is assumed to depend only on the previous word:",
        "And the probability P(wi I wi−1) can be estimated by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle:",
        "Given S = w1w2 ... wm , an ngram model estimates the log probability of the word string, log P(S) , by rewriting Equation (2.2):",
        "where m is the string length, wi is the i -th word in the string S. From the ngram model as in Equation (2.3), we have:",
        "P(wi−1w ) where MI(w;−1, wi, d =1) =log 1 i",
        "sequence occurs in the training text.",
        "In practice, due to the data sparseness problem, some smoothing technique (e.g. Good Turing in [Chen and Goodman 1999]) is applied to get more accurate estimation.",
        "Obviously, an ngram model assumes that the probability of the next word wi is independent of the word string w;-n in the history.",
        "The difference between bigram, trigram and other ngram models is the value of n. The parameters of an ngram model are thus the probabilities: P(wi 1)P(wi ) is the mutual information of the word string pair (wi-1, wi) , and MI(MI((w'=1 w. d =1 lo P(w'−n+1wi) is n w'-i'+,, +1� a, ) – g ( i n+1) l a) P wi_ P w. the mutual information of the word string pair (2.5) (w,−n+1, wi) .",
        "d is the distance of the two word strings in the word string pair and is equal to 1 when the two word strings are adjacent.",
        "For a pair (A, B) over a distance d where A and B are word strings, the mutual information MI (A, B, d) reflects the degree of preference relationship between the two strings over a distance d. Several properties of the mutual information are apparent:",
        "• For the same distance d, MI(A,B,d) ≠ MI(B,A,d).",
        "• For different distances d1 and d 2 , MI(A,B,d1) ≠ MI(A,B,d2).",
        "• If A and B are independent over a distance d, then MI (A, B, d) = 0.",
        "MI (A, B, d) reflects the change of the information content when two word strings A and B are correlated.",
        "That is to say, the higher the value of MI (A, B, d) , the stronger affinity A and B have.",
        "Therefore, we can use the mutual information to measure the preference relationship degree of a word string pair.",
        "Using an alternative view of equivalence, an ngram model is one that partitions the data into equivalence classes based on the last n-1 words in the history.",
        "Viewed in this way, a bigram induces a partition based on the last word in the history.",
        "A trigram model further refines this partition by considering the next-to-last word and so on.",
        "As the word trigram model is most widely used in current research, we will mainly consider the word trigram-based model.",
        "By rewriting Equation (2.2), the word trigram model estimates the log probability of the string log P(S) as:",
        "By taking a log function to both sides of Equation (3.2), we have",
        "= logP(wi)+MI(wi,H,1) Now we assume MI(H,wi,d =1) = MI(X,wi,d =1) +MI(w1,wi,d =i) (3.4) where H = w;-1 , X = u;2-1 and i > N. That is to say, the mutual information of the next word with the history is assumed equal to the summation of that of the next word with the first word in the history and that of the next word with the rest word string in the history.",
        "Then we can rewrite Equation (3.3) by using Equation (3.4),",
        "By applying Equation (3.6) repeatedly, we have a modified estimation of the conditional probability:",
        "Obviously, the first item in equation (3.7) contributes to the log probability of the normal word ngram within an N-words window while the second item is the mutual information which contributes to the long distance context dependency of the next word wi with the previous words wj (1≤ j≤ i − N, i > N) outside the n-words window of the normal word ngram model.",
        "From Equation (3.8), we can see that the first three items are the values computed by the normal word trigram model as shown in Equation (2.9) and the forth item",
        "summation of the mutual information of the next word with the words in the history W;-n Therefore, we call Equation (3.8) as a MI-Ngram model and rewrite it as:",
        "As a special case of N=3, the MI-Trigram model estimate the log probability of the string as follows: �r",
        "Compared with the normal word ngram model, the novel MI-Ngram model also incorporates the long distance context dependency by computing the mutual information of the distance dependent word pairs.",
        "That is, the MI-Ngram model incorporates the word occurrences beyond the scope of the normal ngram model.",
        "Since the number of possible distance-dependent word pairs may be very huge, it is impossible for the MI-Ngram model to incorporate all the possible distance-dependent word pairs.",
        "Therefore, for the MI-Ngram model to be practically useful, how to select a reasonable number of word pairs becomes most important.",
        "Here two approaches are used (Zhou G.D., et al. 1998): One approach is to restrict the window size of possible word pairs by computing and comparing the conditional perplexities (Shannon C.E.",
        "1951) of the long distance word bigram models for different distances.",
        "Conditional perplexity is a measure of the average number of possible choices there are for a conditional distribution.",
        "The conditional perplexity of a conditional distribution with the conditional entropy H(YI X) is defined to be 2H(Y|X) .",
        "Given two random variables X and Y, a conditional probability mass function PY|X (y |x) , and a marginal probability mass function PY (y) , the conditional entropy of Y given X, H(Y |X) , is defined as:",
        "For a large enough corpus, the conditional perplexity is usually an indication of the amount of information conveyed by the model: the lower the conditional perplexity, the more information it conveys and thus a better model.",
        "This is because the model captures as much as it can of that information, and whatever uncertainty remains shows up in the conditional perplexity.",
        "Here, the corpus is the XinHua corpus, which has about 57M(million) characters or 29M words.",
        "For all the experiments, 80% of the corpus is used for",
        "training while the remaining 20% is used for testing.",
        "Table 1 shows that the conditional perplexity is lowest for d = 1 and increases significantly as we move through d = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.",
        "For d = 7, 8, 9, the conditional perplexity increases slightly while further increasing d almost does not increase the conditional perplexity.",
        "This suggests that significant information exists only in the last 6 words of the history.",
        "In this paper, we restrict the maximum window size to 10.",
        "Another approach is to adapt average mutual information to select a reasonable number of distance-dependent word pairs:",
        "Obviously, Equation (3.12) takes the joint probability into consideration.",
        "That is, those frequently occurring word pairs are more important and have much more potential to be incorporated into the MI-Ngram model than less frequently occurring word pairs."
