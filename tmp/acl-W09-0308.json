        "The rapid growth in the digitisation of data has caused many curators, researchers, and data managers of cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums) to turn to knowledge management systems.",
        "Using these systems typically causes them to think about the ontological structure of their domain, involving the identification of key classes in object data and metadata features, and importantly, their relations.",
        "The starting point of this process is often a more classical \"flat\" database matrix model of size n x m, where n is the number of collection items, and m is a fixed number of database columns, typically denoting object metadata features, as cultural heritage institutions are generally well accustomed to using databases of that type.",
        "An ontology can be bootstrapped from such a database by first assuming that the database columns can be mapped onto the domain's ontological classes.",
        "The next step is then to determine which classes are related to each other, and by which relation.",
        "In this paper we present a method that partially automates this process.",
        "To gather evidence for a relation to exist between two ontological classes, it is not possible to simply look up the classes in text.",
        "Rather, classes are realised typically as a multitude of terms or phrases.",
        "For example, the natural history class \"species\" is realised as many different instances of species names in text.",
        "The automatic discovery of relations between ontological classes thus requires at least a two-step approach: first, the identification of instances of ontological classes in text and their particular relations, and second, the aggregation of these analyses in order to find evidence for a most likely relation.",
        "It is common in ontology construction to use predicative labels for relations.",
        "Although no regulations for label names exist, often a verb or verb phrase head is taken, optionally combined with a prepositional head of the subsequent verb-attached phrase (e. g., \"occurs in\", or \"donated by\").",
        "In this study, we make the assumption that good candidate labels are frequent verbs or verb phrases found between instances from a particular pair of classes, and that this may sometimes involve a verb-attached prepositional phrase containing one of the two terms.",
        "In this paper we explore this route, and present a case study on the discovery of predicative labels on relations in an ontology for animal specimen collections.",
        "The first step, identifying instances of ontological classes, is performed by selecting pairs of instances from a flat n x m specimen database, in which the instances are organised by the database columns, and there is a one-to-one relationship between the database columns and the classes in our ontology.",
        "Any approach that bases itself on text to discover relations, is dependent on the quality of that text.",
        "In this study we opt for Wikipedia as a resource from which to extract relations between terms.",
        "Although the status of Wikipedia as a dependable resource is debated, in part because of its dynamic nature, there is some evidence that Wikipedia can be as reliable a source as one that is maintained solely by experts (Giles, 2005).",
        "Wikipedia is also an attractive resource due to its size (currently nearly 12 million articles in over 250 languages).",
        "Additionally, Wikipedia's strongly hyperlinked structure closely resembles a semantic net, with its untyped (but directed) relations between the concepts represented by the article topics.",
        "Since the hyperlinks in Wikipedia indicate a relations between two encyclopaedia articles, we aim at discovering the type of relation such a link denotes through the use of syntactic parsing of the text in which the link occurs.",
        "The idea of using Wikipedia for relation extraction is not new (Auer and Lehmann, 2007; Nakayama et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2007; Suchanek et al., 2006; Syed et al., 2008).",
        "However, most studies so far focus on the structured information already explicit in Wikipedia, such as its infoboxes and categories.",
        "The main contributions of our work are that we focus on the information need emerging from a specific domain, and that we test a method of pre-selection of sentences to extract relations from.",
        "The selection is based on the assumption that the strongest and most reliable lexical relations are those expressed by hyperlinks in Wikipedia pages that relate an article topic to another page (Kamps and Koolen, 2008).",
        "The selection procedure retains only sentences in which the topic of the article, identified by matching words in the article title, links to another Wikipedia article.",
        "The benefit of the preselection of sentences is that it reduces the workload for the syntactic parser.",
        "Since the system is intentionally kept lightweight, the extraction of relations from Wikipedia is sufficiently fast, and we observe that the results are sufficient to build a basic ontology from the data.",
        "This paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review related work.",
        "In Section 3 the data used in this work is described, followed by the system in Section 4 and an explanation of how we evaluated the possible relations our system discovered is presented in Section 5.",
        "We report on the results of our study in Section 6, and formulate our conclusions and points for further research in Section 7."

        "Infoboxes are consistently formatted tables in articles that provide summary information, such as information about area, population and language for countries, and birth dates and places for persons.",
        "Although infoboxes provide rich structured information, their templates are not yet standardised, and their use has not permeated throughout the whole of Wikipedia.",
        "Although the category and infobox structures in Wikipedia already provide a larger coverage at the concept or term level than for instance WordNet, they do not express all possibly relevant semantic relations.",
        "Especially in specific domains, relations occur that would make the Wikipedia data structure unnecessarily dense if added, thus an approach that exploits more of the linguistic content of Wikipedia is desirable.",
        "Such approaches can be found in (Nakayama et al., 2008) and (Nguyen et al., 2007).",
        "In both works full sections of Wikipedia articles are parsed, entities are identified, and the verb between the entities is taken as the relation.",
        "They also extract relations that are not backed by a link in Wikipedia, resulting in common-sense factoids such as 'Brescia is a city'.",
        "For a domain specific application this approach lacks precision.",
        "In our approach, we care more for high precision in finding relations than for recall; hence, we carefully preselect ontological classes among which relations need to be found, and use these as filters on our search.",

        "They acknowledge that the link structure in Wikipedia denotes a potentially meaningful relation between two articles, though the relation type is unknown.",
        "They propose an extension to the editing software of Wikipedia to enable users to define the type of relation when they add a link in Wikipedia.",

        "The presence of a link is incorporated in our system by only using sentences from Wikipedia articles that contain links to other Wikipedia articles.",
        "Only those sentences are parsed that contain the two terms we aim to find a relation between, after which the verb phrase and possibly the article or preposition following it are selected for evaluation by four human judges.",

        "By adding the constraint that at least one of the query terms should be the subject of a sentence, and by ranking results by frequency, our system succeeds in extracting correct and informative relations labels.",

        "Currently we only include sentences in our Wikipedia corpus that contain the literal words from the title of the article, to ensure we have content that is actually about the article and not a related topic.",
        "This causes many sentences in which the topic is referred to via anaphoric expressions to be missed.",
        "(Nguyen et al., 2007) take the most frequently used pronoun in the article as referring to the topic.",
        "This still leaves the problem of cases in which a person is first mentioned by his/her full name and subsequently only by last name.",
        "Coreference resolution may help to solve this, although accuracies of current systems for encyclopaedic text are often not much higher than baselines such as those adopted by (Nguyen et al., 2007).",
        "Errors in the database lead to some noise in the selection of the correct Wikipedia article.",
        "The queries we used are mostly single-word and two-word terms, which makes disambiguation hard.",
        "Fortunately, we have access to the class label (i.e., the database column name) which may be added to the query to prevent retrieval of an article about a country when a value from a person name column is queried.",
        "We would also like to investigate whether querying terms from a particular database column to Wikipedia can identify inconsistencies in the database and hence perform a database cleanup.",
        "Potentially, extraction of relation labels from Wikipedia articles can also be used to assign types to links in Wikipedia."
