        "Inference tasks in NLP often involve searching for an optimal output from a large set of structured outputs.",
        "For many complex models, selecting the highest scoring output for a given observation is slow or even intractable.",
        "One general technique to increase efficiency while preserving optimality is A* search (Hart et al., 1968); however, successfully using A* search is challenging in practice.",
        "The design of admissible (or nearly admissible) heuristics which are both effective (close to actual completion costs) and also efficient to compute is a difficult, open problem in most domains.",
        "As a result, most work on search has focused on non-optimal methods, such as beam search or pruning based on approximate models (Collins, 1999), though in certain cases admissible heuristics are known (Och and Ney, 2000; Zhang and Gildea, 2006).",
        "For example, Klein and Manning (2003) show a class of projection-based A* estimates, but their application is limited to models which have a very restrictive kind of score decomposition.",
        "In this work, we broaden their projection-based technique to give A* estimates for models which do not factor in this restricted way.",
        "Like Klein and Manning (2003), we focus on search problems where there are multiple projections or \"views\" of the structure, for example lexical parsing, in which trees can be projected onto either their CFG backbone or their lexical attachments.",
        "We use general optimization techniques (Boyd and Van-denberghe, 2005) to approximately factor a model over these projections.",
        "Solutions to the projected problems yield heuristics for the original model.",
        "This approach is flexible, providing either admissible or nearly admissible heuristics, depending on the details of the optimization problem solved.",
        "Furthermore, our approach allows a modeler explicit control over the trade-off between the tightness of a heuristic and its degree of inadmissibility (if any).",
        "We describe our technique in general and then apply it to two concrete NLP search tasks: bitext parsing and lexicalized monolingual parsing."

        "Many inference problems in NLP can be solved with agenda-based methods, in which we incrementally build hypotheses for larger items by combining smaller ones with some local configurational structure.",
        "We can formalize such tasks as graph search problems, where states encapsulate partial hypotheses and edges combine or extend them locally.",
        "For example, in HMM decoding, the states are anchored labels, e.g. VBD[5], and edges correspond to hidden transitions, e.g. VBD[5] – DT[6].",
        "The search problem is to find a minimal cost path from the start state to a goal state, where the path cost is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.",
        "Local Configurations",
        "Figure 1: Example cost factoring: In (a), each cell of the matrix is a local configuration composed of two projections (the row and column of the cell).",
        "In (b), the top matrix is an example cost matrix, which specifies the cost of each local configuration.",
        "The bottom matrix represents our factored estimates, where each entry is the sum of configuration projections.",
        "For this example, the actual cost matrix can be decomposed exactly into two projections.",
        "In (c), the top cost matrix cannot be exactly decomposed along two dimensions.",
        "Our factored cost matrix has the property that each factored cost estimate is below the actual configuration cost.",
        "Although our factorization is no longer tight, it still can be used to produce an admissible heuristic.",
        "For probabilistic inference problems, the cost of an edge is typically a negative log probability which depends only on some local configuration type.",
        "For instance, in PCFG parsing, the (hyper)edges reference anchored spans X[i, j], but the edge costs depend only on the local rule type X – YZ.",
        "We will use a to refer to a local configuration and use c(a) to refer to its cost.",
        "Because edge costs are sensitive only to local configurations, the cost of a path is a c(a).",
        "A* search requires a heuristic function, which is an estimate h(s) of the completion cost, the cost of a best path from state s to a goal.",
        "In this work, following Klein and Manning (2003), we consider problems with projections or \"views,\" which define mappings to simpler state and configuration spaces.",
        "For instance, suppose that we are using an HMM to jointly model part-of-speech (POS) and named-entity-recognition (NER) tagging.",
        "There might be one projection onto the NER component and another onto the POS component.",
        "Formally, a projection n is a mapping from states to some coarser domain.",
        "A state projection induces projections of edges and of the entire graph n(G).",
        "We are particularly interested in search problems with multiple projections ..., ng] where each projection, ni, has the following properties: its state projections induce well-defined projections of the local configurations nj(a) used for scoring, and the projected search problem admits a simpler inference.",
        "For instance, the POS projection in our NER-POS HMM is a simpler HMM, though the gains from this method are greater when inference in the projections have lower asymptotic complexity than the original problem (see sections 3 and 4).",
        "In defining projections, we have not yet dealt with the projected scoring function.",
        "Suppose that the cost of local configurations decomposes along projections as well.",
        "In this case, where A is the set of local configurations and ci(a) represents the cost of configuration a under projection ni.",
        "A toy example of such a cost decomposition in the context of a Markov process over two-part states is shown in figure 1(b), where the costs of the joint transitions equal the sum of costs of their projections.",
        "Under the strong assumption of equation (1), Klein and Manning (2003) give an admissible A* bound.",
        "They note that the cost of a path decomposes as a sum of projected path costs.",
        "Hence, the following is an admissible additive heuristic (Felner where hi* (s) denote the optimal completion costs in the projected search graph ni(G).",
        "That is, the completion cost of a state bounds the sum of the completion costs in each projection.",
        "In virtually all cases, however, configuration costs will not decompose over projections, nor would we expect them to.",
        "For instance, in our joint POS-NER task, this assumption requires that the POS and NER transitions and observations be generated independently.",
        "This independence assumption undermines the motivation for assuming a joint model.",

        "Second, the best paths in the projections will be overly optimistic because they have been decoupled (see figure 5 for an example of decoupled best paths in projections).",
        "We can find factored costs 0i(a) which are point-wise admissible by solving an optimization problem.",
        "We think of our unknown factored costs as a block vector 0 = [0i,.., 0e], where vector 0i is composed of the factored costs, 0i(a), for each configuration a G A.",

        "In the case where we minimize the 1-norm or oo-norm, the problem above reduces to a linear program, which can be solved efficiently for a large number of variables and constraints.",
        "Viewing our procedure decision-theoretically, by minimizing the norm of the pointwise gaps we are effectively choosing a loss function which decomposes along configuration types and takes the form of the norm (i.e. linear or squared losses).",
        "A complete investigation of the alternatives is beyond the scope of this work, but it is worth pointing out that in the end we will care only about the gap on entire structures, not configurations, and individual configuration factored costs need not even be pointwise admissible for the overall heuristic to be admissible.",
        "Notice that the number of constraints is |A|, the number of possible local configurations.",
        "For many search problems, enumerating the possible configurations is not feasible, and therefore neither is solving an optimization problem with all of these constraints.",
        "We deal with this situation in applying our technique to lexicalized parsing models (section 4).",
        "Sometimes, we might be willing to trade search optimality for efficiency.",
        "In our approach, we can explicitly make this trade-off by designing an alternative optimization problem which allows for slack in the admissibility constraints.",

        "Each 7\" > 0 represents a configuration where our factored projection estimate is not pointwise admissible.",
