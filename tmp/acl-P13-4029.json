        "Such initiatives are typically labour and time intensive, and require continual effort to maintain interest through the creation of new content.",
        "To date, initiatives such as OPAL have largely focused on biological recording as a public engagement tool, thereby using - for example - standard social networking sites to prompt the collection of species distributional data (Stafford et al., 2010), or web interfaces that use NLG to provide feedback to citizen scientists (Blake et al., 2012).",
        "We propose something altogether different: the use of sensor data as a starting point for public engagement through the delivery of self-updating automatically generated blogs.",
        "This application provides fresh challenges for the field of NLG, where typically systems are designed to offer decision support in the workplace (Goldberg et al., 1994; Portet et al., 2009).",

        "This does not mean that there is no precedent to our work.",
