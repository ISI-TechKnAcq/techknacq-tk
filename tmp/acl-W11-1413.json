      "text": [
        "An obvious way to generate sense-targeted contexts is to generate contexts containing the target word, and use Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to select the ones that use the target word sense.",
        "However, without taking the target word sense into account, the generation process may not output any contexts that use it.",
        "Instead, we model word senses as topics and incorporate their sense indicators into the generation process - words that imply a unique word sense when they co-occur with a target word.",
        "For example, retreat can mean \"a place of privacy; a place affording peace and quiet.\"",
        "Indicators for this sense, in decreasing order of Pr(word | topic for target sense), include retreat, yoga, place, retreats, day, home, center, church, spiritual, life, city, time, lake, year, room, prayer, years, school, dog, park, beautiful, area, and stay.",
        "Generated contexts include ... retreat in this bustling city....",
        "Another sense of retreat (as defined in WordNet) is \"(military) a signal to begin a withdrawal from a dangerous position,\" for which indicators include states, war, united, american, military, flag, president, world, bush, state, Israel, Iraq, international, national, policy, forces, foreign, nation, administration, power, security, iran, force, and Russia.",
        "Generated contexts include ...military leaders believe that retreat.",
        ".",
        "We decompose our approach into two phases, summarized in Figure 1.",
        "Section 2.1 describes the Sense Indicator Extraction phase, which obtains indicators for each WordNet synset of the target word.",
        "Section 2.2 describes the Context Generation phase, which generates contexts that contain the target word and indicators for the target sense.",
        "Kulkarni and Pedersen (2005) and Duan and Yates (2010) performed Sense Indicator Extraction, but the indicators they extracted are not sense targeted.",
        "Content words in the definition and examples for each sense are often good indicators for that sense, but we found that on their own they did poorly.",
        "One reason is that such indicators sometimes co-occur with a different sense.",
        "But the main reason is that there are so few of them that the word sense often appears without any of them.",
        "Thus we need more (and if possible better) sense indicators.",
        "To obtain sense-targeted indicators for a target word, we first assemble a corpus by issuing a Google query for each synset of the target word.",
        "The query lists the target word and all content words in the synset's WordNet definition and examples, and specifies a limit of 200 hits.",
        "The resulting corpus contains a few hundred documents.",
        "To extract sense indicators from the corpus for a word, we adapt Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.",
        "2003).",
        "LDA takes as input a corpus of documents and an integer k, and outputs k latent topics, each represented as a probability distribution over the corpus vocabulary.",
        "For k, we use the number of word senses.",
        "To bias LDA to learn topics corresponding to the word senses, we use the content words in their WordNet definitions and examples as seed words.",
        "After learning these topics and filtering out stop words, we pick the 30 highest-probability words for each topic as indicators for the corresponding word sense, filtering out any words that also indicate other senses.",
        "We create a corpus for each target word and run LDA on it.",
        "Having outlined the extraction process, we now explain in more detail how we learn the topics; the mathematically faint-hearted may skip to Section 2.2.",
        "Formally, given corpus with documents, let be the number of topics, and let and be the parameters of the document and topic distributions respectively.",

        "We allow them to be different in order to use the seed words as high confidence indicators of target senses to bias the hyper-parameters of their document distributions.",

        "Here denotes the topic assignments to all other words in the corpus except ; is the number of times word is assigned to topic in the whole corpus; is the number of words assigned to topic in the entire corpus;",

        "For each document that contains seed words of some synset, we bias toward the topic for that synset by making ai z larger; specifically, we set each ai z to 10 times the average value of at.",
        "This bias causes more words wnew in Dt to be assigned to topic because the words of are likely to be relevant to .",
        "These assignments then influence the topic distribution of so as to make likelier to be assigned to in any document , and thus shift the document distribution in towards z.",
        "By this time we are back to the start of the loop where the document distribution of is biased to .",
        "Thus this procedure can discover more sense indicators for each sense.",
        "Our method is a variant of Labeled LDA (L-LDA) (Ramage 2009), which allows only labels for each document as topics.",
        "In contrast, our variant allows all topics for each document, because it may use more than one sense of the target word.",
        "Allowing other senses provides additional flexibility to discover appropriate sense indicators.",
        "The LDA method we use to obtain sense indicators fits naturally into the framework of bootstrapping WSD (Yarowsky 1995; Mihalcea 2002; Martinez et al.",
        "2008; Duan and Yates 2010), in which seeds are given for each target word, and the goal is to disambiguate the target word by bootstrapping good sense indicators that can identify the sense.",

        "Starting with a 5-gram that contains the target word, VEGEMATIC extends it by concatenating additional 5-grams that overlap by 4 words on the left or right.",
        "To satisfy various constraints on good contexts for learning the meaning of a word, VEGEMATIC uses various heuristic filters.",
        "For example, to generate contexts likely to be informative about the word meaning, VEGEMATIC prefers 5-grams that contain words related to the target word, i.e., that occur more often in its presence.",
        "However, this criterion is not specific to a particular target sense.",
        "To make VEGEMATIC sense-targeted, we modify this heuristic to prefer 5-grams that contain sense indicators.",

        "To evaluate our method, we picked 8 target words from a list of polysemous vocabulary words used in many domains and hence important for children to learn (Beck et al.",
        "2002).",
        "Four of them are nouns: advantage (with 3 synsets), content (7), force (10), and retreat (7).",
        "Four are verbs: dash (6), decline (7), direct (13), and reduce (20).",
        "Some of these words can have other parts of speech, but we exclude those senses, leaving 73 senses in total.",
        "We use their definitions from WordNet because it is a widely used, comprehensive sense inventory.",
        "Some alternative sense inventories might be unsuitable.",
        "For instance, children's dictionaries may lack WordNet's rare senses or hypernym relations.",
        "We generated contexts for these 73 word senses as described in Section 2, typically 3 examples for each word sense.",
        "To reduce the evaluation burden on our human judges, we chose just one context for each word sense, and for words with more than 10 senses we chose a random sample of them.",
        "To avoid unconscious bias, we chose random contexts rather than the best ones, which a human would likelier pick if vetting the generated contexts by hand.",
        "For comparison, we also evaluated WordNet examples (23 in total) where available.",
        "We gave three native English-speaking college-educated judges the examples to evaluate independently, blind to their intended sense.",
        "They filled in a table for each target word.",
        "The left column listed the examples (both generated and WordNet) in random order, one per row.",
        "The top row gave the WordNet definition of each synset, one per column.",
        "Judges were told: For each example, put a 1 in the column for the sense that best fits how the example uses the target word.",
        "If more than one sense fits, rank them 1, 2, etc.",
        "Use the last two columns only to say that none of the senses fit, or you can't tell, and why.",
        "(Only 10 such cases arose.)",
        "We measured inter-rater reliability at two levels.",
        "At the fine-grained level, we measured how well the judges agreed on which one sense fit the example best.",
        "The value of Fleiss' Kappa (Shrout and Fleiss 1979) was 42%, considered moderate.",
        "At the coarse-grained level, we measured how well judges agreed on which sense(s) fit at all.",
        "Here Fleiss' Kappa was 48%, also considered moderate.",
        "We evaluated the examples on three criteria.",
        "Yield is the percentage of intended senses for which we generate at least one example - whether it fits or not.",
        "For the 73 synsets, this percentage is 92%.",
        "Moreover, we typically generate 3 examples for a word sense.",
        "In comparison, only 34% of the synsets have even a single example in WordNet.",
        "(Fine-grained) precision is the percentage of examples that the intended sense fits best according to the judges.",
        "Human judges often disagree, so we prorate this percentage by the percentage of judges who chose the intended sense as the best fit.",
        "The result is algebraically equivalent to computing precision separately according to each judge, and then averaging the results.",
        "Precision for generated examples was 36% for those 23 synsets and 27% for all 67 synsets with generated examples.",
        "Although we expected WordNet to be a gold standard, its precision for the 23 synsets having examples was 52% – far less than 100%.",
        "This low precision suggests that the WordNet contexts to illustrate different senses were often not informative enough for the judges to distinguish them from all the other senses.",
        "For example, the WordNet example reduce one's standard of living is attached to the sense \"lessen and make more modest.\"",
        "However, this sense is hard to distinguish from \"lower in grade or rank or force somebody into an undignified situation.\"",
        "In fact, two judges did not choose the first sense, and one of them chose the second sense as the best fit.",
        "Coarse-grained precision is similar, but based on how often the intended sense fits the example at all, whether or not it fits best.",
        "Coarse-grained precision was 67% for the 23 WordNet examples, 40% for the examples generated for those 23 syn-sets, and 33% for all 67 generated examples.",
        "Coarse-grained precision is important because fine-grained semantic distinctions do not matter in illustrating a core sense of a word.",
        "The problem of how to cluster fine-grained senses into coarse senses is hard, especially if consensus is required (Navigli et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Rather than attempt to identify a single definitive partition of a target word's synsets into coarse senses, we implicitly define a coarse sense as the subset of synsets rated by a judge as fitting a given example.",
        "Thus the clustering into coarse senses is not only judge-specific but example-specific: different, possibly overlapping sets of synsets may fit different examples.",
        "Recall is the percentage of synsets that fit their generated examples.",
        "Algebraically it is the product of precision and yield.",
        "Fine-grained recall was 25% for the generated examples, compared to only 18% for the WordNet examples.",
        "Coarse-grained recall was 30% for the generated examples, compared to 23% for the WordNet examples.",
        "Figure 2 shows how yield, inter-rater agreement, and coarse and fine precision for the 8 target words vary with their number of synsets.",
        "With so few words, this analysis is suggestive, not conclusive.",
        "We plot all four metrics on the same [0,1] scale to save space, but only the last two metrics have directly comparable values, However, it is still meaningful to compare how they vary.",
        "Precision and inter-rater reliability generally appear to decrease with the number of senses.",
        "As polysemy increases, the judges have more ways to disagree with each other and with our program.",
        "Yield is mostly high, but might be lower for words with many senses, due to deficient document corpora for rare senses.",
        "Table 1 compares the generated and WordNet examples on various measures.",
        "It compares precision on the same 23 senses that have WordNet examples.",
        "It compares recall on all 73 senses.",
        "It compares Kappa on the 23 WordNet examples and the sample of generated examples the judges rated.",
        "Table 1 : Generated examples vs. WordNet",
        "Errors occur when 1) the corpus is missing a word sense; 2) LDA fails to find good sense indicators; or 3) Context Generation fails to generate a sense-appropriate context.",
        "Our method succeeds when (1) the target sense occurs in the corpus, (2) LDA finds good indicators for it, and (3) Context Generation uses them to construct a sense-appropriate context.",
        "For example, the first sense of advantage is \"the quality of having a superior or more favorable position,\" for which we obtain the sense indicators support, work, time, order, life, knowledge, mind, media, human, market, experience, nature, make, social, information, child, individual, cost, people, power, good, land, strategy, and company, and generate (among others) the context ...knowledge gave him an advantage... .",
        "Errors occur when any of these 3 steps fails.",
        "Step 1 fails for the sense \"reduce in scope while retaining essential elements\" of reduce because it is so general that no good example exists in the corpus for it.",
        "Step 2 fails for the sense of force in \"the force of his eloquence easily persuaded them\" because its sense indicators are men, made, great, page, man, time, general, day, found, side, called, and house.",
        "None of these words are precise enough to convey the sense.",
        "Step 3 fails for the sense of advantage as \"(tennis) first point scored after deuce,\" with sense indicators point, game, player, tennis, set, score, points, ball, court, service, serve, called, win, side, players, play, team, games, match, wins, won, net, deuce, line, opponent, and turn.",
        "This list looks suitably tennis-related.",
        "However, the generated context ...the player has an advantage... fits the first sense of advantage; here the indicator player for the tennis sense is misleading."
