        "Due to grammatical similarities, even a one-to-one mapping between Korean and Japanese words (or morphemes) can usually result in a high quality Korean-to-Japanese machine translation.",
        "However, multi-word translation units (MWTU) such as idioms, compound words, etc., need an n-to-m mapping, and their component words often do not appear adjacently, resulting in a discontinuous MWTU.",
        "During translation, the MWTU should he treated as one lexical item rather than a phrase.",
        "In this paper, we define the types of MWTUs and propose their representation and recognition method depending on their characteristics in Korean-to-Japanese MT system.",
        "In an experimental evaluation, the proposed method turned out to be very effective in handling MWTUs, showing an average recognition accuracy of 98.4% and a fast recognition time."

        "As a transfer problem in a machine translation (MT), lexical and structural differences exist between source and target languages, which requires 1-n, m-n, or n-1 mapping strategies for machine translation system.",
        "For such mapping strategies, we need to treat several (n, or m) words (or morphemes) as a single translation unit.",
        "Although some researches (D.Santos,1990; Linden E.,1990; Yoon Sung Hee, 1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994; D.Arnold,1994) employ the term \"idiom\" for these units, we prefer MWTU (Multi-Word Translation Unit) because it is a more general and broader term for MT environment.",
        "Up to now, some research has focused on recognition and transfer of MWTUs, although very little research has been undertaken for Korean-to-Japanese machine translation systems (Seon-Ho Kim,1997).",
        "In previous researches, some tended to simplify the problem by treating only special types of MWTUs, while others had some recognition errors and took too much recognition time because they did not restrict the recognition scope (D.Santos,1990; Yoon Sung Hee,1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994; Seon-Ho Kim,1997).",
        "For a Korean-to-English MT, Lee and Kim (Ha Gyu Lee,1994) uses only weak restrictions like adjacent information for recognition scope.",
        "However, their method needs stronger restrictions to resolve recognition errors and to speed up the process.",
        "Although some differences exist depending on which kinds of source and target languages are dealt with, MWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT frequently have their component words close together, so that one can predict the location of their separated component words.",
        "For this reason, we can enhance the recognition accuracy and time effectively by restricting the recognition scope according to the characteristics of an MWTU rather than taking the whole sentence as the scope.",
        "Moreover, the method by Lee and Kim (Ha Gyu Lee,1994) deals with only surface-level consistency without considering word order because Korean has almost free word order.",
        "It is obvious that the method can deal with variable",
        "word-order MWTUs, but some incorrect recognition results are possible when meaning changes according to word order.",
        "Because MWTUs to he treated in Korean-to-Japanese MT have an almost fixed word order sequence, their meaning may vary if the word order is changed.",
        "In (I), both sentences have the same lexical words (or morphemes), but while the first sentence must he treated as an MWTU, the second, which has the different sequence from the first, does not have the meaning of an MWTU.",
        "In (1), the words surrounded with a box are an essential component morpheme for an MWTU.",
        "In this paper, to solve the word order problem and thus enhance a recognition accuracy and time for MWTUs, we fix the word order in an MWTU and define the recognition scope of component words according to their characteristics.",
        "Based on it, then we propose a representation and recognition method of MWTUs for a Korean-to-Japanese MT system.",
        "In the rest of this paper, details will be presented about these proposed ideas, together with some evaluation results.",
        "For representing Korean and Japanese expressions, the 1994-SK (ROK Ministry of Education) and the Kunrei Romanization systems are used respectively."

        "In developing MT systems, we frequently contact with some differences in word spacing, grammar, and so on, between source and target languages.",

        "There can be 1-1, 1-m, n-1, and nm mapping relations of morphemes between source and target language in machine translation.",
        "Due to the grammatical similarities of Korean and Japanese, Korean-to-Japanese machine translation systems have been developed under the direct MT strategy, which assumes a 1 1 mapping relation.",
        "But a uniform application of this I 1 mapping relation will easily result in an unnatural translation.",
        "It is not difficult to handle a 1-1 and 1-m mapping relations in Korean-to-Japanese MT system although it uses only direct MT strategy, because it is easy to recognize only one morpheme in source language, Korean.",
        "It is also due to the fact that Japanese correspondences have characteristics of non-spacing and continuity, which allows several words to be treated as a single word.",
        "In this reason, we need to consider just types with n-1 and nm mapping relations.",
        "Table 1 shows the types of MWTUs to be handled in Korean-to-Japanese MT.",
        "The compound words in Table 1 are the units that must be translated into one Japanese morpheme though they are compound words in Korean.",
        "For example, \"wodett peurosesco\" is a Korean compound word which consists of two morphemes \"wodett\" and \"pettroseseo\", but its Japanese equivalent is only one morpheme, \"wapuro\".",
        "The Korean word \"yeeiju co ho [-dal\" is also a compound word, made by 2 lexical morphemes \"yeoliu\" and \"ho\" and 1 functional morpheme \"-eo\", hut it also corresponds to only one Japanese equivalent morpheme, \"ttkagal--ur.",
        "In these cases, the Korean compound words should be recognized as one unit to be transformed into one Japanese morpheme.",
        "We can classify verbal nouns into 2 types according to their Japanese equivalents.",
        "Table 2 shows them.",
        "If we define a Korean verbal noun as X and its equivalent in Japanese as X', and another single word in Japanese as Y, we can describe the two types of relations between Korean and Japanese verbal nouns as below.",
        "Although the type 1 satisfies 1:1 mapping relation, the type 2 does not.",
        "So, for the type2, the verbal noun, X (e.g., \"chuka\") and \"ha[-dar need to be recognized as a single unit to be transformed into a Japanese equivalent, Y.",
        "Collocation patterns arc the units that frequently co-occurr in sentences and affect the semantics of each other.",
        "There are two kinds of collocation patterns.",
        "In one, each component morpheme is translated into different equivalents, such as \"damhae /-read] piu[-da](smoke)\" corresponding to \"tabako –o std-u]\", and in the other, all component morphemes must be translated into one Japanese morpheme with an equivalent meaning, such as \"soran [-etd] pit(-dal\" corresponding to \"sawa[-gu]\".",
        "While the morphemes in the former case have a 1-to- I mapping relation, the morphemes in the latter case have an n-to-1 mapping relation and therefore, must be treated as a single morpheme.",
        "While some modalities consist of only one morpheme like \"-eot\" or \"-da\", there are also some modalities made up of several morphemes like \"-neon geot gat\".",
        "Accordingly, the latter must be handled as an MWTU.",
        "An Idiom is a general idiomatic unit defined in a dictionary.",
        "Generally, since an idiom does not reflect literal meaning itself, translating their component morphemes individually results in very different meaning.",
        "In this case, it must be treated as a single unit.",
        "A colloquial idiomatic phrase is also composed of several morphemes, but it is recognized like a single unit word.",
        "For instance, the Korean greeting \"cheoeum hoep get -seumnida\" corresponds to \"hazime –maxi -le\" in Japanese.",
        "In this case, a 1-to-1 mapping transformation results in an unnatural translation.",
        "Therefore, it also should be recognized as MWTUs.",
        "Moreover, MWTUs can be used for groups of words that can give a more natural translation when they are treated as one unit.",
        "We will call these groups of words semi-words."

        "Although sonic MWTUs have characteristics of extension by insertion of other words, component morphemes in an MWTU have strong cohesion, not only logically but also physically.",
        "This means that the recognition of an MWTU is possible by local comparison of its physical location.",
        "But it does not imply that the scope is limited in a simple sentence structure.",
        "4) The predictable recognition scope of MWTUs It is possible to predict the recognition scope between two adjacent component morphemes of MWTUs, according to the above characteristics.",
        "The scope can he predicted as follows for each type of MWTUs shown in Table I.",
        "Component morphemes of a compound word are contiguous to the next one, so their scopes are predictable.",
        "Both verbal nouns and collocation patterns have the form combined with \"Noun\" and \"Verb\", where other words can be inserted between them.",
        "But in the case of \"Nottn+Verb+Verb\", which is the form that another verb is inserted between the noun and verb, its meaning may be different in that of an MWTU.",
        "So the scope of the \"Verb\" can be limited up to the position of the first verb appearing after the \"Noun\", that is, the position where the POS(part-of-speech) appears.",
        "Component morphemes of a modality have an especially strong cohesion.",
        "So at most, one particle is often inserted next to the bound noun.",
        "From this, we can predict the next component morpheme apart from pre component at most in distance 2.",
        "Idioms, colloquial idiomatic phrases and semi-words consist of various component morphemes, which results in various scopes for MWTU recognition.",
        "The scopes of each component morphemes from pre-component morphemes can be determined by distance distance 2, or infinity.",
