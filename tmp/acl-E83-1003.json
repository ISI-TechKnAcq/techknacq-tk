        "The system of the iterative operations, which makes a part of aspectual operation system, is based on the assumption that the general mechanism of repetition is language independent and can be reduced to a small number of operations, though language expressions of repetition are different from language to language.",
        "It must be noticed that even in one language there are usually several means to express repetitious events.",
        "We know that \"il lui cognait la tote contre le mur\" and \"il lui a cogn4 deux ou trois fois la tote contre le mur\", the examples given by W. Pollak, express the same event.",
        "We have also linguistic means for iterative expressions on all linguistic levels: morphological, syntactical, semantic, pragmatic etc.",
        "As the general form of repetition we use = (Oit in which f is the whole event, Oia single occurrence of a single event and* an iteration indicator.",

        "sign will be replaced later by a single or complex operator or operators, which operate(s) on 0i.",
        "We hope also to be able to give various expressions to the same event and for that purpose we are planning to have a set of interpretation rules.",
        "The language mainly concerned is Japanese, but in this article examples are given in French, in English or in German.",
        "2 BASIC CONDITION OF THE ITERATION The iterative aspect is one of sentential aspect and denotes plural occurrence of an event or an action.",
        "The iterative aspect concerns therefore the property of countability.",
        "The iterative operations give the iterative aspect to a proposition and are concerned with the plurality of occurrences of the event.",
        "As we distinguish count nouns (count terms) from non-count nouns (mass terms), we distinguish countable events from non-countable events, or more precisely, the events of which the number of occurrences is countable and those of which the number of occurrences is non-countable.",
        "As a count noun has a clear boundary, a countable event also has to have a clear boundary.",
        "Countable events are for instance: he opens a window; he reads a book; he kicks a ball etc.",
        "Non-countable events are for instance: he swims; he sleeps deeply; he runs fast,etc.",
        "Only a countable event can be repeated: he opens three windows; he kicked the ball twice,etc.",
        "A ngn-countable event can't be repeated: •he sleeps twice.",
        "The distinction of two kinds of events (and of two kinds of propositions), which also is called telic-atelic, cyclic-non-cyclj.c or bounded-non bounded dis-tinction' is therefore necessary for the execution of the iterative operations.",
        "It must be useful to give here some remarks on the terminology.",
        "The terms such as 'iterative', 'repetitive', 'frequentative' and 'multiplicative' are used very often as synonyms.",
        "However there are some works which distinguish them one from the other The term repetitive is used sometimes to indicate only one repetition and the term iterative to indicate more than two repetitions.",
        "And sometimes the term iterative is used for one repetition and the term frequentative is used for several repetitions.",
        "We use both of the terms 'iterative' and 'repetitive', (hence 'iteration' and 'repetition')as synonyms.",
        "In this article 'repetition' means, in most of cases, two or more occurrences of a same event.",
        "But in order to prevent a misunderstanding, we rather use the term 'iteration'.",
        "A 'proposition' denotes an event and it is a neutral expression in the sense that the tense, aspect and mode operators operate on it."

        "NO1 gains usually an interpretation of NO2, and P01 that of P02.",
        "For example, \"I walked three times this week\" can be interpreted as: \"I walked three times from the house to the station this week.\"",
