        "This information is used to annotate the input sentence.",
        "which is then processed by the text-to-speech programs currently under development at Bell Labs.",
        "In constructing the ,svstem, our goal has been to test the hypotheses (i) that information available in the syntax tree.",
        "in particular.",
        "grammatical functions such as subject-predicate and head-complement.",
        "is by itself useful in determining prosodic phrasing for synthetic speech.",
        "and (ii) that it is possible to use a syntactic parser that specifies grammatical functions to determine prosodic phrasing for synthetic speech.",
        "Although certain connections between syntax and prosody are well-known (e.g. the influence of part of speech on stress in words like progress.",
        "or the setting off of parenthetical expressions) very little practical knowledge is available on which aspects of syntax might be connected to prosodic phrasing.",
        "In many studies, investigators have sought connections between constituent structure and prosody (e.g. Cooper and Paccia-Cooper 1980.",
        "Umeda 1982.",
        "Gee and Grosjean 1983) but, with the exception of Selkirk (1984).",
        "they tend to neglect the representation of grammatical functions in the syntax tree.",
        "Moreover, previous work has not been specific enough to provide the basis for a full system implementation.",
        "Based on our study of prosodic phrasing in recorded human speech.",
        "we decided to emphasize three aspects of structure that relate to phrasing: syntactic constituency, grammatical function, and constituent length.",
        "These findings.",
        "which we will discuss in detail, have been implemented as a collection of prosody rules in an experimental text-to-speech system.",
        "Two important features characterize our system.",
        "First, the input to our prosody system is a parse tree generated by a version of the deterministic parser Fidditch (Hindle 1983).",
        "The left-corner search strategy of this parser and, in particular, its determinism.",
        "give Fidditch the speed that makes online text-to-speech production feasible.'",
        "In building a parse tree, Fidditch identifies the core subject-verb-object relations but makes no attempt to represent adjunct or modifier relations.",
        "Thus relative clauses.",
        "adverbials, and other non-argument constituents have no specified position in the tree and no specified semantic role.",
        "Second.",
        "the rules in the prosody system build a prosody tree by referring both to the syntactic structure and to earlier stages of prosodic structure.",
        "The result is a hierarchical representation that supports the view, also proposed in Selkirk (1984).",
        "that grammatical function information is related to prosodic phrasing, but indirectly, through different levels of processing.",
        "Informal tests of the system show that it is capable of producing a significant improvement in the prosodic quality of the resulting synthesized speech.",
        "Our investigations of the system's problems.",
        "which we describe, have not revealed any serious counterexample to our basic approach.",
        "In many cases.",
        "it appears that problems with the current version can be resolved by taking our approach a step further, and including lexical information required by the parser as another factor in the determination of prosodic phrasing.",
        "TEXT-TO-SPEECH Most text-to-speech systems comprise two components: pronunciation rules and a speech synthesizer.",
        "Pronunciation rules convert the input text into a phonetic transcription; this information may also be supplemented by a dictionary that provides information about the part of speech.",
        "stress pattern, and phonetic makeup of particular words.",
        "The speech",
        "synthesizer then converts this phonetic transcription into a series of speech parameters which are subsequently processed to produce digitized speech.",
        "While these systems tend to perform quite well on word pronunciation, they fall short when it comes to providing good prosody for complete sentences.",
        "Current text-to-speech systems have no access to the syntactic and semantic properties of a sentence that influence phrase-level prosody.",
        "Hence rules for sentence prosody, when they are provided at all typically depend on superficial aspects of text (e.g. punctuation) and on heuristics that vary widely in sophistication.",
        "Although such techniques often add a more natural quality to the resulting synthetic speech, they can fail in important ways, for example.",
        "by ignoring the prosodic event between a lengthy subject and a predicate, so that there is no clear prosodic boundary between right and mark, in The characters on the right mark the salient features.-Several authors (e.g. Allen 1976; Elovitz et al.",
        "1976; Luce et al.",
        "1983) have suggested that prosodic differences between synthetic and natural speech are the primary, unaddressed factor leading to difficulties in the comprehension of fluent synthetic speech.",
        "The relation between phrase-level prosody and its sources, however, is so poorly understood that we have no good sense of the degree to which different levels of explanation--syntactic.",
        "semantic, or pragmatic--are applicable.",
        "We currently have reasonable tools for automatic syntactic analysis of a text, but there is nothing equivalently well-developed for semantic or pragmatic textual analysis.",
        "Thus an obvious goal is to explore the extent to which phrase-level prosody can be explained by the syntax tree and develop a detailed description of that relation.",
        "A further goal is to convert the resulting insights about this relation into a system that can work with a speech synthesizer.",
        "This allows us to test our description more adequately and perhaps also produce something that will further text-to-speech technology."

        "The modularity of our system enables us to alter each module independently in order to test different hypotheses.",

        "Fidditch represents this as a difference in the level of the complement sentence.",

        "The existence of this prosody system makes the problem areas in the syntax-prosody relation more tractable by allowing online testing of a large body of data.",
        "For example, the prosodically different character of the two classes of complement sentences discussed above became apparent after several examples from each class were run through the system.",
        "We therefore feel we have built a tool that will aid in designing better approximations of sentence prosody as it relates to syntactic structure."
