        "Parallel texts – texts that are translations of each other – are an important resource in many NLP applications.",
        "They provide indispensable training data for statistical machine translation (Brown et al.",
        "1990; Och and Ney 2002) and have been found useful in research on automatic lexical acquisition (Gale and Church 1991; Melamed 1997), cross-language information retrieval (Davis and Dunning 1995; Oard 1997), and annotation projection (Diab and Resnik 2002; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wi-centowski 2001).",
        "Unfortunately, parallel texts are also scarce resources: limited in size, language coverage, and language register.",
        "There are relatively few language pairs for which parallel corpora of reasonable sizes are available; and even for those pairs, the corpora come mostly from one domain, that of political discourse (proceedings of the Canadian or European Parliament, or of the United Nations).",
        "This is especially problematic for the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), because translation systems trained on data from a particular domain (e.g., parliamentary proceedings) will perform poorly when translating texts from a different domain (e.g., news articles).",
        "One way to alleviate this lack of parallel data is to exploit a much more available and diverse resource: comparable non-parallel corpora.",
        "Comparable corpora are texts that, while not parallel in the strict sense, are somewhat related and convey overlapping information.",
        "Good examples are the multilingual news feeds produced by news agencies such as Agence France Presse, Xinhua News, Reuters, CNN, BBC, etc.",
        "Such texts are widely available on the Web for many language pairs and domains.",
        "They often",
        "contain many sentence pairs that are fairly good translations of each other.",
        "The ability to reliably identify these pairs would enable the automatic creation of large and diverse parallel corpora.",
        "However, identifying good translations in comparable corpora is hard.",
        "Even texts that convey the same information will exhibit great differences at the sentence level.",
        "Consider the two newspaper articles in Figure 1.",
        "They have been published by the English and French editors of Agence France Presse, and report on the same event, an epidemic of cholera in Pyongyang.",
        "The lines in the figure connect sentence pairs that are approximate translations of each other.",
        "Discovering these links automatically is clearly non-trivial.",
        "Traditional sentence alignment algorithms (Gale and Church 1991; Wu 1994; Fung and Church 1994; Melamed 1999; Moore 2002) are designed to align sentences in parallel corpora and operate on the assumption that there are no reorderings and only limited insertions and deletions between the two renderings of a parallel document.",
        "Thus, they perform poorly on comparable, non-parallel texts.",
        "What we need are methods able to judge sentence pairs in isolation, independent of the (potentially misleading) context.",
        "This article describes a method for identifying parallel sentences in comparable corpora and builds on our earlier work on parallel sentence extraction (Munteanu, Fraser, and Marcu 2004).",
        "We describe how to build a maximum entropy-based classifier that can reliably judge whether two sentences are translations of each other, without making use of any context.",
        "Using this classifier, we extract parallel sentences from very large comparable corpora of newspaper articles.",
        "We demonstrate the quality of our",
        "A pair of comparable texts.",
        "extracted sentences by showing that adding them to the training data of an SMT system improves the system’s performance.",
        "We also show that language pairs for which very little parallel data is available are likely to benefit the most from our method; by running our extraction system on a large comparable corpus in a bootstrapping manner, we can obtain performance improvements of more than 50% over a baseline MT system trained only on existing parallel data.",
        "Our main experimental framework is designed to address the commonly encountered situation that exists when the MT training and test data come from different domains.",
        "In such a situation, the test data is in-domain, and the training data is out-of-domain.",
        "The problem is that in such conditions, translation performance is quite poor; the out-of-domain data doesn’t really help the system to produce good translations.",
        "What is needed is additional in-domain training data.",
        "Our goal is to get such data from a large in-domain comparable corpus and use it to improve the performance of an out-of-domain MT system.",
        "We work in the context of Arabic-English and Chinese-English statistical machine translation systems.",
        "Our out-of-domain data comes from translated United Nations proceedings, and our in-domain data consists of news articles.",
        "In this experimental framework we have access to a variety of resources, all of which are available from the Linguistic Data Consortium:1",
        "• large amounts of out-of-domain parallel data; • smaller amounts of in-domain parallel data; • in-domain MT test corpora with four reference translations; and • in-domain comparable corpora: large collections of Arabic, Chinese, and English news articles from various news agencies.",
        "In summary, we call in-domain the domain of the test data that we wish to translate; in this article, that in-domain data consists of news articles.",
        "Out-of-domain data is data that belongs to any other domain; in this article, the out-of-domain data is drawn from United Nations (UN) parliamentary proceedings.",
        "We are interested in the situation that exists when we need to translate news data but only have UN data available for training.",
        "The solution we propose is to get comparable news data, automatically extract parallel sentences from it, and use these sentences as additional training data; we will show that doing this improves translation performance on a news test set.",
        "The Arabic-English and Chinese-English resources described in the previous paragraph enable us to simulate our conditions of interest and perform detailed measurements of the impact of our proposed solution.",
        "We can train baseline systems on UN parallel data (using the data from the first bullet in the previous paragraph), extract additional news data from the large comparable corpora (the fourth bullet), accurately measure translation performance on news data against four reference translations (the third bullet), and compare the impact of the automatically extracted news data with that of similar amounts of human-translated news data (the second bullet).",
        "In the next section, we give a high-level overview of our parallel sentence extraction system.",
        "In Section 3, we describe in detail the core of the system, the parallel sentence classifier.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss several data extraction experiments.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate the extracted data by showing that adding it to out-of-domain parallel data improves the in-domain performance of an out-of-domain MT system, and in Section 6, we show that in certain cases, even larger improvements can be obtained by using bootstrapping.",
        "In Section 7, we present examples of sentence pairs extracted by our method and discuss some of its weaknesses.",

        "Comparable corpora are inherently noisy environments, where even similar content may be expressed in very different ways.",
        "Moreover, out-of-domain corpora introduce additional difficulties related to limited dictionary coverage.",
        "Therefore, the ability to reliably judge sentence pairs in isolation is crucial.",
        "Comparable corpora of interest are usually of large size; thus, processing them requires efficient algorithms.",
        "The computational processes involved in our system are",
        " quite modest.",
        "All the operations necessary for the classification of a sentence pair (filter, word alignment computation, and feature extraction) can be implemented efficiently and scaled up to very large amounts of data.",
        "The task can be easily parallelized for increased speed.",
        "For example, extracting data from 600k English documents and 500k Chinese documents (Section 4.2) required only about 7 days of processing time on 10 processors.",
        "The data that we extract is useful.",
        "Its impact on MT performance is comparable to that of human-translated data of similar size and domain.",
        "Thus, although we have focused our experiments on the particular scenario where there is little in-domain training data available, we believe that our method can be useful for increasing the amount of training data, regardless of the domain of interest.",
        "As we have shown, this could be particularly effective for language pairs for which only very small amounts of parallel data are available.",
        "By acquiring a large comparable corpus and performing a few bootstrapping iterations, we can obtain a training corpus that yields a competitive MT system.",
        "We suspect our approach can be used on comparable corpora coming from any domain.",
        "The only domain-dependent element of the system is the date window parameter of the article selection stage (Figure 7); for other domains, this can be replaced with a more appropriate indication of where the parallel sentences are likely to be found.",
        "For example, if the domain were that of technical manuals, one would cluster printer manuals and aircraft manuals separately.",
        "It is important to note that our work assumes that the comparable corpus does contain parallel sentences (which is the case for our data).",
        "Whether this is true for comparable corpora from other domains is an empirical question outside the scope of this article; however, both our results and those of Resnik and Smith (2003) strongly indicate that good data is available on the Web.",
        "Lack of parallel corpora is a major bottleneck in the development of SMT systems for most language pairs.",
        "The method presented in this paper is a step towards the important goal of automatic acquisition of such corpora.",
        "Comparable texts are available on the Web in large quantities for many language pairs and domains.",
        "In this article, we have shown how they can be efficiently mined for parallel sentences."
