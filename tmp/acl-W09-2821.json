        "This endeavor yielded three separate systems: one utilizing the original classifier, another with a retrained classifier, and a third taking advantage of new data to improve the identification of interfering antecedents.",
        "Each subsequent system improved upon the results of the previous iteration."

        "This paper provides a system report on our submission for the GREC-NEG (Named Entity Generation) Task, one of the two shared task competitions for Generation Challenges 2009.",
        "The objective is to select the most appropriate reference to named entities from a given list of alternatives.",
        "The corpus consists of introductory sections from approximately 1,000 Wikipedia articles in which single and plural references to all people mentioned in the text have been annotated (Belz and Varges, 2007).",
        "The training set contains articles from the categories of Chefs, Composers, and Inventors.",
        "GREC-NEG differs from the other challenge task, GREC-MSR (Main Subject References), in that systems must now account for multiple entities rather than a single main subject, and the corpus includes only articles about persons rather than a variety of topics."

        "Our GREC-NEG systems build upon our work for the GREC-MSR task.",
        "Our original approach was to consult findings in psycholinguistic research for guidance regarding appropriate feature selection for the production of referring expressions.",
        "We relied upon several common factors recognized by multiple authors (Arnold, 1998; Gordon and Hendrick, 1998) , including Subjecthood, Parallelism, Recency, and Ambiguity.",
        "We followed (McCoy and Strube, 1999) who stressed the importance of Recency in reference generation.",
        "Finally, we made a preliminary attempt at identifying potential interfering antecedents that could affect the Ambiguity of pronouns (Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004).",
        "As an initial attempt (UDel-NEG-1), we simply extended our GREC-MSR submission.",
        "By adapting our system to account for multiple entities and the slightly different data format, we were able to use the existing classifier to generate references for GREC-NEG.",
        "We suspected that accuracy could be improved by retraining the classifier, so our next system (UDel-NEG-2) added entity and mention numbers as features to train on.",
        "Presumably, this could help distinguish between the main subject and secondary entities, as well as plural references.",
        "As all named entities are tagged in the GREC-NEG corpus, we leveraged this information to improve our recognition of other antecedents interfering with pronoun usage in a third new system (UDel-NEG-3).",
        "As in our GREC-MSR submission, all three of our GREC-NEG systems trained C5.0 decision trees (RuleQuest Research Pty Ltd, 2008) on our set of features informed by psycholinguistic research."
