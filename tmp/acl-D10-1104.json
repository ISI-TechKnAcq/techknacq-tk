        "The verb choice highly depends on its usage context which is not consistently captured by local features.",
        "We then combine these semantic features with other local features under the generalized perceptron learning framework.",

        "Verbs in English convey actions or states of being.",
        "In addition, they also communicate sentiments and imply circumstances, e.g., in \"He got [gained] the scholarship after three interviews.",
        "', the verb \"gained' may indicate that the \"scholarship\" was competitive and required the agent's efforts; in contrast, \"got\" sounds neutral and less descriptive.",
        "This work has been done while the author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "Since verbs carry multiple important functions, misusing them can be misleading, e.g., the native speaker could be confused when reading \"I like looking [reading] books\".",
        "Unfortunately, according to (Gui and Yang, 2002; Yi et al., 2008), more than 30% of the errors in the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC) are verb choice errors.",
        "Hence, it is useful to develop an approach to automatically detect and correct verb selection errors made by ESL learners.",
        "However, verb selection is a challenging task because verbs often exhibit a variety of usages and each usage depends on a particular context, which can hardly be adequately described by conventional n-gram features.",
        "For instance, both \"made\" and \"received\" can complete \"I have __ a telephone call.",
        "\", where the usage context can be represented as \"made/received a telephone call\"; however, in \"I have __ a telephone call from my boss\", the prepositional phrase \"from my boss\" becomes a critical part of the context, which now cannot be described by n-gram features, resulting in only \"received\" being suitable.",
        "Some researchers (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008) exploited syntactic information and n-gram features to represent verb usage context.",
        "Yi et al.",
        "(2008) introduced an unsupervised web-based proofing method for correcting verb-noun collocation errors.",
        "Brockett et al.",
        "(2006) employed phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to correct countability errors.",
        "None of their methods incorporated semantic information.",
        "Unlike the other papers, we derive features from the output of an SRL (MÃ rquez, 2009) system to explicitly model verb usage context.",
        "SRL is generally understood as the task of identifying the arguments of a given verb and assigning them semantic labels describing the roles they play.",
        "For example, given a sentence \"I want to watch TV tonight\" and the target predicate \"watch\", the output of SRL will be something like \"I [A0] want to watch [target predicate] TV [Al] tonight [AM-TMP].",
        "\", meaning that the action \"watch\" is conducted by the agent \"I\", on the patient \"TV\", and the action happens \"tonight\".",
        "We believe that SRL results are excellent features for characterizing verb usage context for three reasons: (i) Intuitively, the predicate-argument structures generated by SRL systems capture major relationships between a verb and its contextual participants and consequently largely determine whether or not the verb usage is proper.",
        "For example, in \"I want to watch a match tonight.",
        "\", \"match\" is the patient of \"watch\", and \"watch ... match\" forms a collocation, suggesting \"watch \" is appropriately used.",
        "(ii) Predicate-argument structures abstract away syntactic differences in sentences with similar meanings, and therefore can potentially filter out lots of noise from the usage context.",
        "For example, consider \"I want to watch a football match on TV tonight\": if \"match\" is successfully identified as the agent of \"watch\", \"watch .",
        "football\", which is unrelated to the usage of \"watch\" in this case, can be easily excluded from the usage context.",
        "(iii) Research on SRL has made great achievements, including human-annotated training corpora and state-of-the-art systems, which can be directly leveraged.",
        "Taking an English sentence as input, our method first generates correction candidates by replacing each verb with verbs in its predefined confusion set; then for every candidate, it extracts SRL-derived features; finally our method scores every candidate using a linear function trained by the generalized perceptron learning algorithm (Collins, 2002) and selects the best candidate as output.",
        "Experimental results show that SRL-derived features are effective in verb selection, but we also observe that noise in SRL output adversely increases feature space dimensions and the number of false suggestions.",
        "To alleviate this issue, we use local features, e.g., n-gram-related features, and achieve state-of-the-art performance when all features are integrated.",
        "Our contributions can be summarized as follows:",

        "Our method can be regarded as a pipeline consisting of three steps.",
        "Given as input an English sentence written by ESL learners, the system first checks every verb and generates correction candidates by replacing each verb with its confusion set.",
        "Then a feature vector that represents verb usage context is derived from the outputs of an SRL system and then multiplied with the feature weight vector trained by the generalized perceptron.",

        "Correction candidates are generated by replacing each checkpoint with its confusions.",
        "Table 1 shows a sentence with one checkpoint and the corresponding correction candidates.",
        "One state-of-the-art SRL system (Riedel and Meza-Ruiz, 2008) is then utilized to extract predicate-argument structures for each verb in the input, as illustrated in Table 2.",
        "Semantic features are generated by combining the predicate with each of its arguments; e.g., \"watches_A0_Jane\", \"sees_A0_Jane\", \"watch-es_Al_TV\" and \"sees_Al_TV\" are semantic features derived from the semantic roles listed in Table 2.",
        "At the training stage, each sentence is labeled by the SRL system.",
        "Each correction candidate s is represented as a feature vector O(s) e Rd , where d is the total number of features.",
        "The feature weight vector is denoted as w e Rd, and Score(s) is computed as follows:",
        "Finally, Score(s) is applied to each candidate, and s*, the one with the highest score, is selected as the output, as shown in Table 3.",
        "In the above framework, the basic idea is to generate correction candidates with the help of predefined confusion sets and apply the global linear model to each candidate to compute the degree of its fitness to the usage context that is represented as features derived from SRL results.",
        "To make our idea practical, we need to solve the following three subtasks: (i) generating the confusion set that includes possible replacements for a given verb; (ii) representing the context with semantic features and other complementary features; and (iii) training the feature weight.",

        "So \"say _ Chinese\", which is irrelevant to the usage of said, is not extracted as a feature.",

        "Intuitively, \"wear\" and \"take\" seem to fill the blank well, since they both form a collocation with \"raincoat\"; however, when \"with [AM-MNR] you\" is considered as part of the context, \"wear\" no longer fits it and \"take\" wins.",
        "In this case, the longdistance feature devised from AM-MNR helps select the suitable verb, while the trigram features cannot because they cannot represent the long distance verb usage context.",
        "We also find some typical cases that are beyond the reach of the SRL-derived features.",
        "For instance, consider \"Everyone doubts fsuspects] that Tom is a spy.\".",
        "Both of the verbs can be followed by a clause.",
        "However, the SRL system regards \"is\", the predicate of the clause, as the patient, resulting in features like \"doubt_A1_is\" and \"suspect_A1_is\", which capture nothing about verb usage context.",
        "However, if we consider the whole clause \"sus-pect_Tom is a spy\" as the patient, this could result in a very sparse feature that would be filtered.",
        "In the future, we will combine word-level and phraselevel SRL systems to address this problem.",
        "Besides its incapability of handling verb selection errors involving clauses, the SRL-derived features fail to work when verb selection depends on deep meanings that cannot be captured by current shallow predicate-argument structures.",
        "For example, in \"He was wandering in the park, spending fkilling] his time watching the children playing.",
        "\", though \"spending\" and \"killing\" fit the syntactic structure and collocation agreement, and express the meaning \"to allocate some time doing something\", the word \"wandering\" suggests that \"killing\" may be more appropriate.",
        "Current SRL systems cannot represent the semantic connection between two predicates and thus are helpless for this case.",
        "We argue that the performance of our system can be improved along with the progress of",
