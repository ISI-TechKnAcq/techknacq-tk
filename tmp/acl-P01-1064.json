        "In information retrieval, users are often interested in particular topics (parts) of retrieved documents, instead of the documents themselves.",
        "To meet such needs, documents should be segmented into coherent topics.",

        "Consequently, these methods can be applied to any text in any domain, even if training data do not exist.",
        "This property is important when text segmentation is applied to information retrieval or summarization, because both tasks deal with domain-independent documents.",
        "Another application of text segmentation is the segmentation of a continuous broadcast news story into individual stories (Allan et al., 1998).",
        "In this application, systems relying on supervised learning (Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999) achieve good performance because there are plenty of training data in the domain.",

        "The text segmentation algorithm described in this paper is intended to be applied to the summarization of documents or speeches.",
        "Therefore, it should be able to handle domain-independent texts.",
        "The algorithm thus does not use any training data.",
        "It requires only the given documents for segmentation.",

        "The algorithm selects the optimum segmentation in terms of the probability defined by a statistical model.",
