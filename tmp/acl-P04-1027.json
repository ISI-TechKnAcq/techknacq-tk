        "Two main results are presented: a) the creation of an Information Synthesis testbed with 72 reports manually generated by nine subjects for eight complex topics with 100 relevant documents each; and b) an empirical comparison of similarity metrics between reports, under the hypothesis that the best metric is the one that best distinguishes between manual and automatically generated reports.",

        "The next steps consist of extracting, organizing and relating the relevant pieces of information, in order to obtain a comprehensive, non redundant report that satisfies the information need.",
        "In this paper, we will refer to this process as Information Synthesis.",
        "It is normally understood as an (intellectually challenging) human task, and perhaps the Google Answer Service1 is the best general purpose illustration of how it works.",
        "In this service, users send complex queries which cannot be answered simply by inspecting the first two or three documents returned by a search engine.",

        "b) Provide an analysis on the future of web browsers, if any.",
        "Answers to such complex information needs are provided by experts which, commonly, search the Internet, select the best sources, and assemble the most relevant pieces of information into a report, organizing the most important facts and providing additional web hyperlinks for further reading.",
        "This Information Synthesis task is understood, in Google Answers, as a human task for which a search engine only provides the initial starting point.",
        "Our midterm goal is to develop computer assistants that help users to accomplish Information Synthesis tasks.",
        "From a Computational Linguistics point of view, Information Synthesis can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document sum-marization, where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information.",
        "Unlike indicative summaries (which help to determine whether a document is relevant to a particular topic), informative summaries must be helpful to answer, for instance, factual questions about the topic.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we will use the term “reports” to refer to the summaries produced in an Information Synthesis task, in order to distinguish them from other kinds of summaries.",
        "Topic-oriented multi-document summarization has already been studied in other evaluation initiatives which provide testbeds to compare alternative approaches (Over, 2003; Goldstein et al., 2000; Radev et al., 2000).",
        "Unfortunately, those studies have been restricted to very small summaries (around 100 words) and small document sets (10- 20 documents).",
        "These are relevant summarization tasks, but hardly representative of the Information Synthesis problem we are focusing on.",
        "The first goal of our work has been, therefore, to create a suitable testbed that permits qualitative and quantitative studies on the information synthesis task.",
        "Section 2 describes the creation of such a testbed, which includes the manual generation of 72 reports by nine different subjects across 8 complex topics with 100 relevant documents per topic.",
        "Using this testbed, our second goal has been to compare alternative similarity metrics for the Information Synthesis task.",
        "A good similarity metric provides a way of evaluating Information Synthesis systems (comparing their output with manually generated reports), and should also shed some light on the common properties of manually generated reports.",
        "Our working hypothesis is that the best metric will best distinguish between manual and automatically generated reports.",
        "We have compared several similarity metrics, including a few baseline measures (based on document, sentence and vocabulary overlap) and a state-of-the-art measure to evaluate summarization systems, ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "We also introduce another proximity measure based on key concept overlap, which turns out to be substantially better than ROUGE for a relevant class of topics.",
        "Section 3 describes these metrics and the experimental design to compare them; in Section 4, we analyze the outcome of the experiment, and Section 5 discusses related work.",

        "We decided that the report generation would be an extractive task, which consists of selecting sentences from the documents.",

        "In this paper, we have reported an empirical study of the “Information Synthesis” task, defined as the process of (given a complex information need) extracting, organizing and relating the pieces of information contained in a set of relevant documents, in order to obtain a comprehensive, non redundant report that satisfies the information need.",
        "We have obtained two main results: • The creation of an Information Synthesis testbed (ISCORPUS) with 72 reports manually generated by 9 subjects for 8 complex topics with 100 relevant documents each.",
        "• The empirical comparison of candidate metrics to estimate the similarity between reports.",
        "Our empirical comparison uses a quantitative criterion (the QARLA estimation) based on the hypothesis that a good similarity metric will be able to distinguish between manual and automatic reports.",
        "According to this measure, we have found evidence that the Information Synthesis task is not a standard multi-document summarization problem: state-of-the-art similarity metrics for summaries do not perform equally well with the reports in our testbed.",
        "Our most interesting finding is that manually generated reports tend to have the same key concepts: a similarity metric based on overlapping key concepts (NICOS) gives significantly better results than metrics based on language models, n-gram co-ocurrence and sentence overlapping.",
        "This is an indication that detecting relevant key concepts is a promising strategy in the process of generating reports.",
        "Our results, however, has also some intrinsic limitations.",
        "Firstly, manually generated summaries are extractive, which is good for comparison purposes, but does not faithfully reflect a natural process of human information synthesis.",
        "Another weakness is the maximum time allowed per report: 30 minutes seems too little to examine 100 documents and extract a decent report, but allowing more time would have caused an excessive fatigue to users.",
        "Our volunteers, however, reported a medium to high satisfaction with the results of their work, and in some occasions finished their task without reaching the time limit.",
