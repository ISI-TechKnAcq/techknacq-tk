        "There have been a number of attempts to handle the long-range reordering problem within PSMT.",
        "Many of them are based on the reordering of a source language sentence as a preprocessing step",
        "before translation.",
        "Our approach is related to the work of Collins et al(2005).",
        "They reordered German sentences as a preprocessing step for German-to-English SMT.",
        "Hand-crafted reordering rules are applied on German parse trees in order to move the German verbs into the positions corresponding to the positions of the English verbs.",
        "Subsequently, the reordered German sentences are translated into English leading to better translation performance when compared with the translation of the original German sentences.",
        "We apply this method on the opposite translation direction, thus having English as a source language and German as a target language.",
        "However, we cannot simply invert the reordering rules which are applied on German as a source language in order to reorder the English input.",
        "While the reordering of German implies movement of the German verbs into a single position, when reordering English, we need to split the English verbal complexes and, where required, move their parts into different positions.",
        "Therefore, we need to identify exactly which parts of a verbal complex must be moved and their possible positions in a German sentence.",
        "Reordering rules can also be extracted automatically.",
        "For example, Niehues and Kolss (2009) automatically extracted discontiguous reordering rules (allowing gaps between POS tags which can include an arbitrary number of words) from a word-aligned parallel corpus with POS tagged source side.",
        "Since many different rules can be applied on a given sentence, a number of reordered sentence alternatives are created which are encoded as a word lattice (Dyer et al. 2008).",
        "They dealt with the translation directions German-to-English and English-to-German, but translation improvement was obtained only for the German-to-English direction.",
        "This may be due to missing information about clause boundaries since English verbs often have to be moved to the clause end.",
        "Our reordering has access to this kind of knowledge since we are working with a full syntactic parser of English.",
        "Genzel (2010) proposed a language-independent method for learning reordering rules where the rules are extracted from parsed source language sentences.",
        "For each node, all possible reorderings (permutations) of a limited number of the child nodes are considered.",
        "The candidate reordering rules are applied on the dev set which is then translated and evaluated.",
        "Only those rule sequences are extracted which maximize the translation performance of the reordered dev set.",
        "For the extraction of reordering rules, Genzel (2010) uses shallow constituent parse trees which are obtained from dependency parse trees.",
        "The trees are annotated using both Penn Treebank POS tags and using Stanford dependency types.",
        "However, the constraints on possible reorderings are too restrictive in order to model all word movements required for English-to-German translation.",
        "In particular, the reordering rules involve only the permutation of direct child nodes and do not allow changing of child-parent relationships (deleting of a child or attaching a node to a new father node).",
        "In our implementation, a verb can be moved to any position in a parse tree (according to the reordering rules): the reordering can be a simple permutation of child nodes, or attachment of these nodes to a new father node (cf. movement of bought and read in figure 11).",
        "Thus, in contrast to Genzel (2010), our approach does not have any constraints with respect to the position of nodes marking a verb within the tree.",
        "Only the syntactic structure of the sentence restricts the distance of the linguistically motivated verb movements."
