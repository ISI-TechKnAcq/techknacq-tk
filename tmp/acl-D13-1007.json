        "Social media language can differ substantially from other written text.",
        "Many of the attempts to characterize and overcome this variation have focused on normalization: transforming social media language into text that better matches standard datasets (Sproat et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2011).",
        "Because there is little available training data, and because social media language changes rapidly (Eisenstein, 2013b), fully supervised training is generally not considered appropriate for this task.",
        "However, due to the extremely high-dimensional output space ?",
        "arbitrary sequences of words across the vocabulary ?",
        "it is a very challenging problem for unsupervised learning.",
        "Perhaps it is for these reasons that the most successful systems are pipeline architectures that cobble together a diverse array of techniques and resources, including statistical language models, dependency parsers, string edit distances, off-the-shelf spellcheckers, and curated slang dictionaries (Liu et al., 2011; Han and Baldwin, 2011; Han et al., 2013).",
        "We propose a different approach, performing normalization in a maximum-likelihood framework.",
        "There are two main sources of information to be exploited: local context, and surface similarity between the observed strings and normalization candidates.",
        "We treat the local context using standard language modeling techniques; we treat string similarity with a log-linear model that includes features for both surface similarity and word-word pairs.",
        "Because labeled examples of normalized text are not available, this model cannot be trained in the standard supervised fashion.",
        "Nor can we apply dynamic programming techniques for unsupervised training of locally-normalized conditional models (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010), as their complexity is quadratic in the size of label space; in normalization, the label space is the vocabulary itself, with at least 104 elements.",
        "Instead, we present a new training approach using Monte Carlo techniques to compute an approximate gradient on the feature weights.",
        "This training method may be applicable in other unsupervised learning problems with a large label space.",
        "This model is implemented in a normalization system called UNLOL (unsupervised normalization in a LOg-Linear model).",
        "It is a lightweight proba",
        "bilistic approach, relying only on a language model for the target domain; it can be adapted to new corpora text or new domains easily and quickly.",
        "Our evaluations show that UNLOL outperforms the state-of-the-art on standard normalization datasets.",
        "In addition, we demonstrate the linguistic insights that can be obtained from normalization, using UNLOL to identify classes of orthographic transformations that form coherent linguistic styles."

        "The text normalization task was introduced by Sproat et al. (2001), and attained popularity in the context of SMS messages (Choudhury et al., 2007b).",
        "It has become still more salient in the era of widespread social media, particularly Twitter.",
        "Han and Baldwin (2011) formally define a normalization task for Twitter, focusing on normalizations between single tokens, and excluding multi-word tokens like lol (laugh out loud).",
        "The normalization task has been criticized by Eisenstein (2013b), who argues that it strips away important social meanings.",
        "In recent work, normalization has been shown to yield improvements for part-of-speech tagging (Han et al., 2013), parsing (Zhang et al., 2013), and machine translation (Hassan and Menezes, 2013).",
        "As we will show in Section 7, accurate automated normalization can also improve our understanding of the nature of social media language.",
        "Supervised methods Early work on normalization focused on labeled SMS datasets, using approaches such as noisy-channel modeling (Choudhury et al., 2007a) and machine translation (Aw et al., 2006), as well as hybrid combinations of spelling correction and speech recognition (Kobus et al., 2008; Beaufort et al., 2010).",
        "This work sought to balance language models (favoring words that fit in context) with transformation models (favoring words that are similar to the observed text).",
        "Our approach can also be seen as a noisy channel model, but unlike this prior work, no labeled data is required.",
        "Unsupervised methods Cook and Stevenson (2009) manually identify several word formation types within a noisy channel framework.",
        "They parametrize each formation type with a small number of scalar values, so that all legal transformations of a given type are equally likely.",
        "The scalar parameters are then estimated using expectation maximization.",
        "This work stands apart from most of the other unsupervised models, which are pipelines.",
        "Contractor et al. (2010) use string edit distance to identify closely-related candidate orthographic forms and then decode the message using a language model.",
        "Gouws et al. (2011) refine this approach by mining an ?exception dictionary?",
        "of strongly-associated word pairs such as you/u.",
        "Like Contractor et al. (2010), we apply string edit distance, and like Gouws et al. (2011), we capture strongly related word pairs.",
        "However, rather than applying these properties as filtering steps in a pipeline, we add them as features in a unified log-linear model.",
        "Recent approaches have sought to improve accuracy by bringing more external resources and complex architectures to bear.",
        "Han and Baldwin (2011) begin with a set of string similarity metrics, and then apply dependency parsing to identify contextually-similar words.",
        "Liu et al. (2011) extract noisy training pairs from the search snippets that result from carefully designed queries to Google, and then train a conditional random field (Lafferty et al., 2001) to estimate a character-based translation model.",
        "They later extend this work by adding a model of visual priming, an off-the-shelf spell-checker, and local context (Liu et al., 2012a).",
        "Hassan and Menezes (2013) use a random walk framework to capture contextual similarity, which they then interpolate with an edit distance metric.",

        "For these reasons, we seek a model that permits many overlapping features to describe candidate word pairs.",

        "contains 3,802 individual ?nonstandard?",
        "words (i.e., words that are not in the target vocabulary) and their normalized forms.",
        "The rest of the message in which the words is appear is not available.",
        "As this corpus does not provide linguistic context, its decoding must use a unigram target language model.",
        "The second dataset ?",
        "which is called LexNorm1.1 by its authors Han and Baldwin (2011) ?",
        "contains 549 complete tweets with 1,184 nonstandard tokens (558 unique word types).",
        "In this corpus, we can decode with a trigram language model.",
        "Close analysis of LexNorm1.1 revealed some inconsistencies in annotation (for example, y?all and 2 are sometimes normalized to you and to, but are left unnormalized in other cases).",
        "In addition, several annotations disagree with existing resources on internet language and dialectal English.",
        "For example, smh is normalized to somehow in LexNorm1.1, but internetslang.com and urbandictionary.com assert that it stands for shake my head, and this is evident from examples such as smh at this girl.",
        "Similarly, finna is normalized to finally in LexNorm1.1, but from the literature on African American English (Green, 2002), it corresponds to fixing to (e.g., i?m finna go home).",
        "To address these issues, we have produced a new version of this dataset, which we call LexNorm1.2 (after consulting with the creators of LexNorm1.1).",
        "LexNorm1.2 differs from version 1.1 in the annotations for 172 of the 2140 OOV words.",
        "We evaluate on LexNorm1.1 to compare with prior work, but we also present results on LexNorm1.2 in the hope that it will become standard in future work on normalization in English.",
        "The dataset is available at http://www.cc.gatech.edu/ ~jeisenst/lexnorm.v1.2.tgz.",
        "To obtain unlabeled training data, we randomly sample 50 tweets from the Edinburgh Twitter corpus Petrovic?",
        "et al (2010) for each OOV word.",
        "Some OOV words appear less than 50 times in the corpus, so we obtained more training tweets for them through the Twitter search API.",
        "Metrics Prior work on these datasets has assumed perfect detection of words requiring normalization, and has focused on finding the correct normalization for these words (Han and Baldwin, 2011; Han et al., 2013).",
        "Recall has been defined as the proportion of words requiring normalization which are normalized correctly; precision is defined as the proportion of normalizations which are correct.",
        "Results We run our training algorithm for two iterations (pass the training data twice).",
        "The results are presented in Table 2.",
        "Our system, UNLOL, achieves the highest published F-measure on both datasets.",
        "Performance on LexNorm1.2 is very similar to LexNorm1.1, despite the fact that roughly 8% of the examples were relabeled.",
        "In the normalization task that we consider, the tokens to be normalized are specified in advance.",
        "This is the same task specification as in the prior work against which we compare.",
        "At test time, our system attempts normalizes all such tokens; every error is thus both a false positive and false negative, so precision equals to recall for this task; this is also true for Han and Baldwin (2011) and Liu et al. (2011).",
        "It is possible to trade recall for precision by refusing to normalize words when the system's confidence falls below a threshold.",
        "A good setting of this threshold can improve the F-measure, but we did not report these results because we have no development set for parameter tuning.",
        "Regularization One potential concern is that the number of non-zero feature weights will continually increase until the memory cost becomes overwhelming.",
        "Although we did not run up against mem",
        "ory limitations in the experiments producing the results in Table 2, this issue can be addressed through the application of L1 regularization, which produces sparse weight vectors by adding a penalty of ?||?||1 to the log-likelihood.",
        "We perform online optimization of the L1-regularized log-likelihood by applying the truncated gradient method (Langford et al., 2009).",
        "We use an exponential decreasing learning rate ?k = ?0?k/N , where k is the iteration counter andN is the size of training data.",
        "We set ?0 = 1 and ?",
        "= 0.5.",
        "Experiments were run until 300,000 training instances were observed, with a final learning rate of less than 1/32.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, a small amount of regularization can dramatically decrease the number of active features without harming performance."

        "Some of these styles, such as t-dropping and th-stopping, have direct analogues in spoken language varieties (Tagliamonte and Temple, 2005; Green, 2002), while others, like expressive lengthening, seem more unique to social media.",

        "We have presented a unified, unsupervised statistical model for normalizing social media text, attaining the best reported performance on the two standard normalization datasets.",
