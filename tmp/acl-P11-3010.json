        "Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades.",
        "Although a formidable amount of research has been done but still the existing reported solutions or available systems are far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction level of end user's.",
        "The main issue may be there are many conceptual rules that govern sentiment, and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being.",

        "In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical analysis plays a crucial role.",
        "For example, words like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate sentiment or opinion.",
        "Various previous works (Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et.",
        "al., 2010) have already proposed techniques for making dictionaries for those sentiment words.",
        "But polarity assignment of such sentiment lexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation problem.",
        "The regulating aspects which govern the lexical level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al., 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hidden aspects.",
        "Therefore it is a challenging and enigmatic research problem.",
        "What previous studies proposed is to attach prior polarity to each sentiment lexicon level.",
        "Prior polarity is an approximation value based on corpus heuristics based statistics and not exact.",
        "The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores do not solve the problem completely rather it shoves the problem into next level, called contextual polarity classification.",
        "The hypothesis we started with is that the summation of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orientation is human psychology and thus it is called multifaceted problem (Liu, 2010).",
        "More precisely what we meant by human psychology is the all known and unknown aspects, directly or indirectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge of us.",
        "The regulating aspects wrapped in the present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, City, Country, Language and Profession.",
        "The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over the existing SentiWordNet to hold the possible psychological ingredients, governs the sentiment understandability of us.",
        "The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variable prior polarity scores, could be fetched depending upon those psychological regulating aspects.",
        "An example may illustrate the definition better for the concept \"Rock_Climbing\":",
        "Aspects (Age) Polarity",
        "In the previous example the described concept \"RockjClimbing\" is generally positive as it is adventurous and people have it to make fun or excursion.",
        "But it demands highly physical ability thus may be not as good for aged people like the younger people.",
        "PsychoSentiWordNet provides good coverage as it an extension over SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et.",
        "al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we propose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment) technology to collect psycho-sentimental polarity for lexicons.",
        "In this section we have philosophically argued about the necessity of developing PsychoSentiWordNet.",
        "In the next section we will describe about the technical proposed architecture for building the lexical resource.",
        "Section 3 explains about some exciting outcomes that support the usefulness of the PsychoSentiWordNet.",
        "What we believe is the developed PsychoSentiWordNet will help automatic sentiment analysis research in many aspect and other disciplines as well, described in the section 4.The data structure and organization is described in section 5 and finally the present paper concluded with section 6."

        "Both types of techniques have few limitations.",
        "Manual annotation techniques are undoubtedly trustable but it generally takes time.",
        "Automatic techniques demands manual validations and are dependent on the corpus availability in the respective domain.",
        "Manual annotation technique required a large number of annotators to balance one's sentimentality in order to reach agreement.",
        "But human annotators are quite unavailable and costly.",
        "But sentiment is a property of human intelligence and is not entirely based on the features of a language.",

        "The game has four types of question templates.",
        "For further detailed description the question templates are named as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.",
