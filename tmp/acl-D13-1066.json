        "For example, sentiment analysis can be easily misled by the presence of words that have a strong polarity but are used sarcastically, which means that the opposite polarity was intended.",

        "In this case, the hashtag #sarcasm reveals the intended sarcasm, but we don't always have the benefit of an explicit sarcasm label.",
        "In the realm of Twitter, we observed that many sarcastic tweets have a common structure that creates a positive/negative contrast between a sentiment and a situation.",
        "Specifically, sarcastic tweets often express a positive sentiment in reference to a negative activity or state.",
        "For example, consider the tweets below, where the positive sentiment terms",
        "are underlined and the negative activity/state terms are italicized.",

        "The goal of our research is to identify sarcasm that arises from the contrast between a positive sentiment referring to a negative situation.",
        "A key challenge is to automatically recognize the stereotypically negative ?situations?, which are activities and states that most people consider to be unenjoyable or undesirable.",
        "For example, stereotypically unenjoyable activities include going to the dentist, taking an exam, and having to work on holidays.",
        "Stereotypically undesirable states include being ignored, having no friends, and feeling sick.",
        "People recognize",
        "these situations as being negative through cultural norms and stereotypes, so they are rarely accompanied by an explicit negative sentiment.",
        "For example, ?I feel sick?",
        "is universally understood to be a negative situation, even without an explicit expression of negative sentiment.",
        "Consequently, we must learn to recognize phrases that correspond to stereotypically negative situations.",
        "We present a bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns phrases corresponding to positive sentiments and phrases corresponding to negative situations.",

        "This work has only scratched the surface of possibilities for identifying sarcasm arising from positive/negative contrast.",
        "The phrases that we learned were limited to specific syntactic structures and we required the contrasting phrases to appear in a highly constrained context.",
        "We plan to explore methods for allowing more flexibility and for learning additional types of phrases and contrasting structures.",
        "We also would like to explore new ways to identify stereotypically negative activities and states because we believe this type of world knowledge is essential to recognize many instances of sarcasm.",
        "For example, sarcasm often arises from a description of a negative event followed by a positive emotion but in a separate clause or sentence, such as: ?Going to the dentist for a root canal this afternoon.",
        "Yay, I can't wait.?",
        "Recognizing the intensity of the negativity may also be useful to distinguish strong contrast from weak contrast.",
