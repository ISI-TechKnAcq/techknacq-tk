        "Ordinary use of Natural Language adheres to what Grice has called the \"cooperative principle of conver-sation\" (Grice, 1975).",
        "Four categories of \"maxims\" elaborate this principle.",
        "Under the category of Relation, Grice places the single maxim \"Be relevant\", noting that this terse formulation conceals a number of unsolved problems, including that of \"what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be\".",
        "This paper addresses \"kinds and focuses of rele-vance\" that a language-generating clinical decision-support system should adhere to during patient-centered activities – that is, activities in which a health care provider's (HCP) attention is on his or her patient and not on a computer screen.'",
        "Such activities include surgery, childbirth, and emergency medical care (including the responsibilities of Emergency Medical Technicians).",

        "This paper describes how plan recognition and plan evaluation can be used to achieve this end.",
        "This work is being done in the context of the TraumAID project (Clarke et al., 1993; Clarke et al., 1994; Rymon et al., 1993; Webber et al., 1992), 'In this sense, our emphasis differs from Sperber and Wilson (Sperber and Wilson, 1986), who are concerned with the problem of inferences that can be made under the assumption of relevance.",

        "Initial definitive management scopes a complex range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",
        "Resolving often conflicting demands for managing multiple injuries requires global reasoning that can exceed the restricted locality of rule– based systems.",
        "The modular architecture of the current system, TraumAID 2.0, consists of two complementary processes: (1) a rule-based reasoner able to draw diagnostic conclusions and identify what goals each of them implies; and (2) a planner that takes the set of currently relevant goals and constructs a management plan – a partially-ordered sequence of actions – that is most appropriate at that point in time.",
        "TraumAID 2.0 has been retrospectively validated against actual trauma management plans for 97 non-pregnant adult patients presenting consecutively to the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP) Trauma Center with penetrating injuries to the chest and/or abdomen.",
        "A blinded comparison of management plans was carried out by a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons.",
        "They preferred TraumAID 2.0's plans to actual management to a statistically significant extent (Clarke et al., 1993).",
        "A decision support system will not be clinically viable without solving its interface problems.",
        "For us, this means (1) getting TraumAID the information it needs for its reasoning and planning, and (2) getting the results of TraumAID's reasoning to the members of the trauma team (in particular, to the chief surgical resident) during the course of care.",
        "To get information into TraumAID, we have developed an electronic version of a standard trauma flow sheet, so that information can be entered by the scribe nurse during the trauma resuscitation.",

        "(Currently, this is displayed on the nurse's monitor in a separate window.)",
        "The reasons for physician dissatisfaction appear to be that (1) much of the time, TraumAID's recom-20ne member of the trauma team is a nurse who functions as a scribe, documenting all the findings, tests, and treatments in chronological order for the record.",
        "The multiple page trauma flow sheet has designated areas for specific information, such as demographics, mechanism of injury, physician response times, trauma score, Glasgow coma score, vital signs, location of wounds, results of primary assessment, intravenous therapy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, medications given, fluid intake and output, and disposition.",
        "mendation coincided with the physicians' own plans, and (2) having the entire plan presented made it difficult for the physicians to determine what, if anything, they should focus on.",
        "To put it another way, presenting the entire plan violates Grice's Maxim of Relevance.",
        "We decided to explore how TraumAID could restrict commentary to only those situations in which a comment would be clinically relevant in terms of its potential for making a clinically significant difference to patient management.",
        "We took advantage of the fact that actions that involve resources that need to be brought to the trauma bay or that can only be done elsewhere must be ordered.",
        "Since orders can be rescinded, comments pointing out problems with an order can potentially make a clinically significant difference to patient management.",
        "Our prototype interface for TraumAID produces commentary when an order differs significantly from what TraumAID would recommend.",
        "It also generates commentary when the physician fails to order something that TraumAID thinks should be done within the immediate time frame.",
        "The interface, TraumaTlQ (Gertner, 1994; Gertner, 1994b), uses plan inference and plan evaluation to recognize both such errors of commission and errors of omission.",
        "In this paper, we describe TraumAID's knowledge of management goals and actions that are used in plan inference and evaluation (Section 2), the plan recognition and evaluation strategies that allow TraumaTlQ to recognize clinically significant differences in patient manage-ment(Section 3), and the additional problems for plan recognition, plan evaluation and critique generation caused by a planner's ability to optimize plans through what Pollack has called \"overloading inten-tions\" (Pollack, 1991) (Section 4).",

        "In TraumAID, a plan is a set of procedures, each of which comprises one or more actions.",
        "Procedures are used to address diagnostic and therapeutic management goals motivated by what is currently known about the patient.",
        "A particular action can participate in more than one procedure, and thus can be used in addressing more than one goal.",
        "As noted earlier, TraumAID uses a rule-based reasoner to derive a set of relevant goals from the currently available knowledge about the patient and a planner to choose appropriate procedures to address those goals and schedules the actions they involve.",
        "TraumAID's reasoner controls information acquisition using a conservative, staged strategy for diagnosis and treatment (Rymon, 1993): expensive, definitive tests are not included in a plan until they are justified by less costly tests or observations, and",
        "definitive treatment is not recommended without the results of sufficient evidence from diagnostic tests.",
        "These strategies are reflected in the knowledge base by the occurrence of related management goals, such as a goal to diagnose hematuria (blood in the urine), which if present, triggers a goal to diagnose bladder injury, which in turn can lead to a goal to treat bladder injury.",
        "Goals that do not participate together in a coherent strategy may still be connected by test results.",
        "For example, the goal of finding a bullet in the mediastinum leads to doing a lateral chest x-ray.",
        "While this might also reveal a fractured sternum, there is no strategic relationship between the goal of finding a bullet in the mediastinum and the goal of treating a fractured sternum.",
        "Once a set of relevant goals has been determined, the planner's choice of how address each goal is based on both local and global considerations.",
        "Goals and procedures are linked via a goal-procedure mapping which lists alternative procedures for addressing each goal.",
        "The procedures in a mapping are listed in order of preference so that, all else being equal, the first procedure will be chosen to address the goal.",

        "Since actions may have constraints on where they can be performed, they are scheduled so as to avoid transferring the patient back to a place he has already been.",

        "The urgency can be either catastrophic, unstable, or stable, representing the patient's condition and thus the amount of time available in which to address that goal.",
        "Catastrophic goals must be addressed immediately.",
        "Unstable goals must be addressed before stable goals.",

        "In order to achieve this, our approach is largely reactive rather than proactive.",
        "As noted in Section 1, instead of presenting Traum-AID's recommended management plan, TraumaTlQ waits for the physician's orders, which are treated as intentions to perform those actions.",

        "In order to judge when it is relevant to comment on a physicians orders or lack thereof, it is useful to consider not only what actions have been ordered, but also why.",

        "assumes that it is being done for the same reason(s).",
        "We call this giving the physician the \"benefit of the doubt.\"",
        "• The physician is more likely to have appropriate goals but be addressing them in a suboptimal way, than to be pursuing the wrong goals altogether.",
        "• While TraumAID follows a conservative strategy for pursuing diagnosis and treatment from observations, physicians may proceed more rapidly, pursuing a goal that may be involved in a current strategy but for which TraumAID does not yet have enough evidence to conclude its relevance.",
        "An understanding of the strategic relationships between goals should help to recognize examples of this difference.",
        "Reflecting these assumptions, the plan recognition algorithm works as follows: 1.",
        "When an action, a, is ordered by the physician, check whether a is currently a part of Traum-AID's recommended plan as a means of satisfying all or part of goal y, or all or part of each member of a set of goals r. 2.",
