        "Monolingual alignment is the task of discovering and aligning similar semantic units in a pair of sentences expressed in a natural language.",
        "Such alignments provide valuable information regarding how and to what extent the two sentences are related.",
        "Consequently, alignment is a central component of a number of important tasks involving text comparison: textual entailment recognition, textual similarity identifica-tion, paraphrase detection, question answering and text summarization, to name a few.",
        "The high utility of monolingual alignment has spawned significant research on the topic in the recent past.",
        "Major efforts that have treated alignment as a standalone problem (MacCartney et al., 2008; Thadani and McKeown, 2011; Yao et al., 2013a) are primarily supervised, thanks to the manually aligned corpus with training and test sets from Microsoft Research (Brockett, 2007).",
        "Primary concerns of such work include both quality and speed, due to the fact that alignment is frequently a component of larger NLP tasks.",
        "Driven by similar motivations, we seek to devise a lightweight, easy-to-construct aligner that produces high-quality output and is applicable to various end tasks.",
        "Amid a variety of problem formulations and ingenious approaches to alignment, we take a step back and examine closely the effectiveness of two frequently made assumptions: 1) Related semantic units in two sentences must be similar or related in their meaning, and 2) Commonalities in their semantic contexts in the respective sentences provide additional evidence of their relatedness (MacCartney et al., 2008; Thadani and McKeown, 2011; Yao et al., 2013a; Yao et al., 2013b).",
        "Alignment, based solely on these two assumptions, reduces to finding the best combination of pairs of similar semantic units in similar contexts.",
        "Exploiting existing resources to identify similarity of semantic units, we search for robust techniques to identify contextual commonalities.",
        "Dependency trees are a commonly used structure for this purpose.",
        "While they remain a central part of our aligner, we expand the horizons of dependency-based alignment beyond exact matching by systematically exploiting the notion of ?type equivalence?",
        "with a small hand-crafted set of equivalent dependency types.",
        "In addi-tion, we augment dependency-based alignment with surface-level text analysis.",
        "While phrasal alignments are important and have 219 Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2 (2014) 219?230.",
        "Action Editor: Alexander Koller.",
        "Submitted 11/2013; Revised 1/2014; Published 5/2014.",
        "c?2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "been investigated in multiple studies, we focus primarily on word alignments (which have been shown to form the vast majority of alignments (?",
        "95%) in multiple human-annotated corpora (Yao et al., 2013b)), keeping the framework flexible enough to allow incorporation of phrasal alignments in future.",
        "Evaluation of our aligner on the benchmark dataset reported in (Brockett, 2007) shows an F1 score of 91.7%: a 3.1% absolute improvement over the previous best system (Yao et al., 2013a), corresponding to a 27.2% error reduction.",
        "It shows superior performance also on the dataset reported in (Thadani et al., 2012).",
        "Additionally, we present results of two extrinsic evaluations, namely textual similarity identification and paraphrase detection.",
        "Our aligner not only outperforms existing aligners in each task, but also approaches top systems for the extrinsic tasks.",
        "2 Background Monolingual alignment has been applied to various NLP tasks including textual entailment recognition (Hickl et al., 2006; Hickl and Bensley, 2007), paraphrase identification (Das and Smith, 2009; Madnani et al., 2012), and textual similarity assessment (Ba?r et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013) ?",
        "in some cases ex-plicitly, i.e., as a separate module.",
        "But many such systems resort to simplistic and/or ad-hoc strategies for alignment and in most such work, the alignment modules were not separately evaluated on alignment benchmarks, making their direct assessment difficult.",
        "With the introduction of the MSR alignment corpus (Brockett, 2007) developed from the second Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge data (Bar- Haim et al., 2006), direct evaluation and comparison of aligners became possible.",
        "The first aligner trained and evaluated on the corpus was a phrasal aligner called MANLI (MacCartney et al., 2008).",
        "It represents alignments as sets of different edit operations (where a sequence of edits turns one input sentence into the other) and finds an optimal set of edits via a simulated annealing search.",
        "Weights of different edit features are learned from the training set of the MSR alignment corpus using a perceptron learning algorithm.",
        "MANLI incorporates only shallow features characterizing contextual similarity: relative positions of the two phrases being aligned (or not) in the two sentences and boolean features representing whether or not the preceding and following tokens of the two phrases are similar.",
        "Thadani and McKeown (2011) substituted MANLI's simulated annealing-based decoding with integer linear programming, and achieved a considerable speed-up.",
        "More importantly for our discussion, they found contextual evidence in the form of syntactic constraints useful in better aligning stop words.",
        "Thadani et al. (2012) further extended the model by adding features characterizing dependency arc edits, effectively bringing stronger influence of contextual similarity into alignment decisions.",
        "Again the performance improved consequently.",
        "The most successful aligner to date both in terms of accuracy and speed, called JacanaAlign, was developed by Yao et al. (2013a).",
        "In contrast to the earlier systems, JacanaAlign is a word aligner that formulates alignment as a sequence labeling problem.",
        "Each word in the source sentence is labeled with the corresponding target word index if an alignment is found.",
        "It employs a conditional random field to assign the labels and uses a feature set similar to MANLI's in terms of the information they encode (with some extensions).",
        "Contextual features include only semantic match of the left and the right neighbors of the two words and their POS tags.",
        "Even though JacanaAlign outperformed the MANLI enhancements despite having less contextual features, it is difficult to compare the role of context in the two models because of the large paradigmatic disparity.",
        "An extension of JacanaAlign was proposed for phrasal alignments in (Yao et al., 2013b), but the contextual features remained largely unchanged.",
        "Noticeable in all the above systems is the use of contextual evidence as a feature for alignment, but in our opinion, not to an extent sufficient to harness its full potential.",
        "Even though deeper dependency-based modeling of contextual commonalities can be found in some other studies (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005; Chambers et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2013c), we believe there is further scope for systematic exploitation of contextual evidence for alignment, which we aim to do in this work.",
        "On the contrary, word semantic similarity has been a central component of most aligners; various measures of word similarity have been utilized, including string similarity, resource-based similarity (derived from one or more lexical resources like WordNet) 220 Align identical word sequences Align named entities Align content words Align stop words Figure 1: System overview and distributional similarity (computed from word co-occurrence statistics in large corpora).",
        "An important trade-off between precision, coverage and speed exists here and aligners commonly rely on only a subset of these measures (Thadani and McKeown, 2011; Yao et al., 2013a).",
        "We use the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), which is a large resource of lexical and phrasal paraphrases constructed using bilingual pivoting (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) over large parallel corpora.",
        "3 System Our system operates as a pipeline of alignment modules that differ in the types of word pairs they align.",
        "Figure 1 is a simplistic representation of the pipeline.",
        "Each module makes use of contextual evidence to make alignment decisions.",
        "In addition, the last two modules are informed by a word semantic similarity algorithm.",
        "Because of their phrasal nature, we treat named entities separately from other content words.",
        "The rationale behind the order in which the modules are arranged is discussed later in this section (3.3.5).",
        "Before discussing each alignment module in de-tail, we describe the system components that identify word and contextual similarity.",
        "3.1 Word Similarity The ability to correctly identify semantic similarity between words is crucial to our aligner, since contextual evidence is important only for similar words.",
        "Instead of treating word similarity as a continuous variable, we define three levels of similarity.",
        "The first level is an exact word or lemma match which is represented by a similarity score of 1.",
        "The second level represents semantic similarity between two terms which are not identical.",
        "To identify such word pairs, we employ the Paraphrase Database (PPDB)1.",
        "We use the largest (XXXL) of the PPDB's lexical paraphrase packages and treat all pairs identically by ignoring the accompanying statistics.",
        "We 1http://paraphrase.org customize the resource by removing pairs of identical words or lemmas and adding lemmatized forms of the remaining pairs.",
        "For now, we use the term ppdbSim to refer to the similarity of each word pair in this modified version of PPDB (which is a value in (0, 1)) and later explain how we determine it (Section 3.3.5).",
        "Finally, any pair of different words which is absent in PPDB is assigned a zero similarity score.",
        "3.2 Extracting Contextual Evidence Our alignment modules collect contextual evidence from two complementary sources: syntactic dependencies and words occurring within a small textual vicinity of the two words to be aligned.",
        "The application of each kind assumes a common principle of minimal evidence.",
        "Formally, given two input sentences S and T , we consider two words s ?",
        "S and t ?",
        "T to form a candidate pair for alignment if ?rs ?",

        "<C2 ; where <C1 and <C2 are binary relations representing specific types of contextual relationships between two words in a sentence (e.g., an nsubj dependency between a verb and a noun).",
        "The symbol ?",
        "represents equivalence between two relationships, including identical-ity.",
        "Note that the minimal-evidence assumption holds a single piece of contextual evidence as sufficient support for a potential alignment; but as we discuss later in this section, an evidence for word pair (s, t) (where s ?",
        "S and t ?",
        "S) may not lead to an alignment if there exists a competing pair (s?, t) or (s, t?)",
        "with more evidence (where s?",
        "?",
        "S and t?",
        "?",

        "To be able to use such evidence for alignment, we need to go beyond exact matching of dependencies and develop a mapping among dependency types that encodes such equivalence.",
        "Note also that the parent-child roles are opposite for the two dependency types in the above example, a scenario that such a mapping must accommodate.",

        "For each row, columns 4 and 5 show two sets of dependency types; each member of the first is equivalent to each member of the second for the current orientation (column 1) and lexical categories of the associated words (columns 2 and 3).",
        "For exam-ple, row 2 represents the fact that an agent relation (between s and rs; s is the parent) is equivalent to an nsubj relation (between t and rt; t is the parent).",
        "Note that the equivalences are fundamentally redundant across different orientations.",
        "For example, row 2 (which is presented as an instance of orientation (a)) can also be presented as an instance of orientation (b) with POS(s)=POS(t)=noun and POS(rs)=POS(rt)=verb.",
        "We avoid such redundancy for compactness.",
        "For the same reason, the equivalence of dobj and rcmod in Figure 2 is shown in the table only as an instance of orientation (c) and not as an instance of orientation (d) (in general, this is why orientations (b) and (d) are absent in the table).",
        "We present dependency-based contextual evidence extraction in Algorithm 1.",
        "(The Stanford dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) is used to extract the dependencies.)",

        "Note that Table 1 only considers content word pairs (si, tj) such that POS(si)=POS(tj), but as 90% of all content word alignments in the MSR alignment dev set are within the same lexical category, this is a reasonable set to start with.",

        "The rationales behind the specific order of the modules can now be explained: (1) wsAlign is a module with relatively higher precision, (2) it is convenient to align named entities before other content words to enable alignment of entity mentions of different lengths, (3) dependency-based evidence was observed to be more reliable (i.e. of higher precision) than textual evidence in the MSR alignment dev set, and (4) stop word alignments are dependent on existing content word alignments.",
        "The aligner assumes two free parameters: ppdbSim and w (in Algorithms 3 and 4).",
        "To determine their values, we exhaustively search through the two-dimensional space (ppdbSim,w) for ppdbSim,w ?",
        "{0.1, ..., 0.9, 1} and the combination (0.9, 0.9) yields the best F1 score for the MSR alignment dev set.",

        "How-ever, as alignment is frequently a component of larger tasks, high accuracy alone is not always sufficient.",
        "Other dimensions of an aligner's usability include speed, consumption of computing resources, replica-bility, and generalizability to different applications.",
        "Our design goals include achieving a balance among such multifarious and conflicting goals.",
        "A speed advantage of our aligner stems from formulating the problem as one-to-one word alignment and thus avoiding an expensive decoding phase.",
        "The presence of multiple phases is offset by discarding already aligned words in subsequent phases.",
        "The use of PPDB as the only (hashable) word similarity resource helps in reducing latency as well as space requirements.",
        "As shown in Section 4.1.1, further speedup could be achieved with only a small performance degradation by considering only the textual neighborhood as source of contextual evidence.",
        "However, the two major goals that we believe the aligner achieves to the greatest extent are replicability and generalizability.",
        "The easy replicability of the aligner stems from its use of only basic and frequently used NLP modules (a lemmatizer, a POS tagger, an NER module, and a dependency parser: all available as part of the Stanford CoreNLP suite7; we use a Python wrapper8) and a single word similarity resource (PPDB).",
        "We experimentally show that the aligner can be successfully applied to different alignment datasets as well as multiple end tasks.",
        "We believe a design characteristic that enhances the generalizability of the aligner is its minimal dependence on the MSR alignment training data, which originates from a textual entailment corpus having unique properties such as disparities in the lengths of the input sentences and a directional nature of their relationship (i.e., the premise implying the hypothesis, but not vice versa).",
        "A related potential reason is the symmetry of the aligner's output (caused by its assumption of no directionality) ?",
        "the fact that it outputs the same set of alignments regardless of the order of the input sentences, in contrast to most existing aligners.",
        "Major limitations of the aligner include the inability to align phrases, including multiword expressions.",
        "It is incapable of capturing and exploiting long distance dependencies among words (e.g. coreferences).",
        "No word similarity resource is perfect and PPDB is no exception, therefore certain word alignments also remain undetected.",
        "6 Conclusions We show how contextual evidence can be used to construct a monolingual word aligner with certain desired properties, including state-of-the-art accuracy, easy replicability, and high generalizability.",
        "Some potential avenues for future work include: allowing phrase-level alignment via phrasal similarity resources (e.g. the phrasal paraphrases of PPDB), including other sources of similarity such as vector space models or WordNet relations, expanding the set 7http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtml 8https://github.com/dasmith/stanford-corenlp-python 228 of dependency equivalences and/or using semantic role equivalences, and formulating our alignment algorithm as objective optimization rather than greedy search.",
