        "Assessing learner texts to classify them into relevant proficiency levels is usually done by human evaluators and is often a time consuming process.",
        "An approach to automate this process would complement the human annotators and reduce the overall effort in evaluating learner texts for their proficiency.",
        "Investigating features that follow any sort of trend across the",

        "This is the main motivation for our research.",
        "Several factors might play a role in determining a learner's proficiency in a given language.",
        "Since we study the learner corpus of Estonian, a morphologically complex language with an elaborate declension and conjugation system, we hypothesized that studying the role of morpho-syntactic features would be a good starting point to perform proficiency classification.",
        "We used the Estonian Interlanguage Corpus (EIC)2, a publicly accessible corpus of written texts produced by learners of Estonian as a second language, for this purpose.",
        "All the texts were annotated with a proficiency level that is based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages Council of Europe (CEFR).",
        "We constructed various proficiency classification models based on this corpus by using features motivated primarily by the morphological complexity of Estonian and found that true to our hypothesis, they turn out to be good predictors of the proficiency level.",
        "We also studied the effect of breaking up the main classification task into subtasks and cascading them.",
        "We show that this approach increases the overall accuracy of proficiency classification.",
        "In addition, we studied the effect of training data size and found that it does not have a significant impact in most of the classification tasks we performed.",
        "To summarize, we studied the task of proficiency classification for Estonian by studying both the aspects feature engineering and model construction.",

        "Compared to Cascade-1, Cascade-2 performed even better with a 66.66% classification accuracy on the test set.",
        "Since binary classification for certain pairs seemed to be possible with higher accuracy than the three-class classification, reformulating three class classification as a cascade of binary classifications may result in a better classification accuracy.",
        "This was the initial motivation for the choice of cascade classification.",
        "Our results clearly showed that it was a fruitful experiment.",
        "The cascades need more exploration though.",
        "Also, although the morphological features turned out to be useful predictors of proficiency classification, the classification accuracies are still not very high.",
        "Two possible explanations could be that our features are good but not sufficient or that the training data was insufficient.",
        "It is clear from our various classification experiments that the morphological features are good predictors of proficiency levels.",
        "But, surely, there is much more to language proficiency than morphological complexity.",
        "So, exploring more features will be the natural next step to improve the overall classification accuracy.",
        "However, to gain some more insights at this level, we studied the effect of training data sizes on the various classification tasks we performed."

        "We took all the seven different classification models we used in the earlier experiments and studied the impact of gradually increasing the training data size on classification accuracy.",
        "For this purpose,we trained all the classifiers with the complete feature set using the SMO algorithm.",
        "The classifiers studied include the three class ABC classifier and the binary classifiers AB, BC, AC, AnotA, BnotB and CnotC.",
        "Table 7 summarizes the effect of splitting the respective training sets into various train-test splits, on the classification accuracies.",
        "As the table shows, training data size had an impact only on some of the classification tasks.",
        "For the three class classification, training set size had a clear effect.",
        "Although our corpus had a large number of texts from A and B compared to C (Table 1), since we used balanced training sets to train all models, the three-class model had relatively fewer number of documents per category (250) compared to, say, the AB classifier (750 per category).",
        "Reduction of this small training set further by 50% decreased the three class classification accuracy from 62.76% (when 80% of the data was used for training) to 56.73%.",
        "So, in this case, training data size had an effect.",
        "However, an interesting observation is that this small training sample size (250 documents per category) did not have any impact on the classification performance of the classifier (A,C).",
        "This classifier consistently performed at a higher level compared to all the other classifiers even when the training data was only 50% (125 documents per category).",
        "Al",
        "though it is possible that the length of the document played a role here, there was little difference in the performance (< 1%) even after removing the text length feature.",
        "This indicates a strong differentiation between the texts of the language learners of levels A and C, in terms of the features we used.",
        "In case of the other classification tasks, only the (B,C) classifier showed some effect of the training data on its overall classification accuracy.",
        "While there might be other reasons that we did not notice yet, it is possible that the inter class overlap between (A,B) is more compared to the overlap between (B,C) at least in terms of the features we considered.",
        "Also, the fact that the B-level lies in between A and C could also have contributed to the fact that more training data has little effect on classifiers involving data from all the three classes (AnotA, BnotB, CnotC)."

        "In this paper, we discussed the task of classifying learner texts into standardized proficiency levels based on the texts produced by learners of Estonian as a second language.",
        "We used the publicly accessible Estonian Interlanguage Corpus (EIC) and modeled our classifiers by considering the morpho-syntactic variation as our primary feature group.",
        "We hypothesized that the morphology may play an important role in detecting the proficiency levels as Estonian is a morphologically rich and complex language.",
        "For building our classifiers, we experimented with various methods such as three class classifiers, an ensemble model and multi-stage cascades.",
        "Our experiments showed that the multi-stage cascades improved the classification accuracy compared to the other approaches.",
        "Our experiments also showed a clear trend across the proficiency levels.",
        "There was little classification overlap between the beginner (A) and the advanced (C) level texts but a strong overlap of both these levels with the intermediate (B) level.",
        "We can conclude from our experiments that the morphological features can indeed play an important role in the proficiency classification of Estonian.",
        "Although the classification accuracies we achieved (60-65%) have a long way to go in terms of a real-world grading application, we believe that this is a good starting point to explore the role of morphology in proficiency classification of Estonian in particular and other morphologically rich languages in general.",
        "As a part of our future work, we intend to investigate the role of morphology in Estonian proficiency classification further.",
        "We also want to compare the proficiency levels across various genres of texts in the corpus (e.g, essays, personal and official letters, translations etc.).",
        "Another interesting dimension we want to explore further is the distribution of specific kinds of morphological phenomena (e.g., case markers) that exist in Estonian but not in the learner's native language, across the different proficiency levels.",
        "It would also be interesting to apply insights from the theories of second language acquisition research and study their utility for proficiency classification.",
        "Apart from morphology, we also intend to study the impact of other features such as lexical sophistication, error rate, syntactic complexity and discourse coherence.",
        "Finally, on the model construction side, we plan to investigate and understand the working of cascaded classifiers better in this context."
