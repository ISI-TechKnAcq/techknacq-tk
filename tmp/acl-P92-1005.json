        "By contrast, aspects of semantic interpretation, such as reference and quantifier scope resolution, are often realised by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations.",
        "A 'twolevel' approach to semantic interpretation tends to result (Bronneberg et al.",
        "1980), where an initial, underspecified representation is transformed into a separate, specified, representation.",
        "The goal of the work described here is to provide a model for semantic interpretation that is fully monotonic in both linguistic and contextual aspects of interpretation, and which employs just one level of semantic representation – Quasi Logical Form (QLF).",

        "specified QLF expressions involves the instantiation of QLF meta-variables.",
        "The semantics for the QLF formalism makes the denotation of a QLF formula a partial function to truth-values, with resolution leading to a monotonic extension of the denotation function.",
        "We believe that there are several advantages to the approach taken, including:",
        "• Order independence of resolution operations • Production of partial interpretations • Simpler interactions between phenomena • Reversibility for synthesis/generation",
        "The QLF formalism is a development of Alshawi 1990.",
        "As before, underspecified QLFs are produced on the basis of a unification grammar.",
        "Previously, QLF resolution was only partially monotonic; full monotonicity required changes to the original QLF formalism and the resolution and scoping processes.",
        "These changes have been implemented in a further development of the Core Language Engine (Alshawi 1992), although we will ignore most implementation issues in the present paper.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides the syntax of the QLF language and Section 3 gives some illustrative examples of monotonic QLF resolution.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present the semantics of the QLF formalism.",
        "Section 6 discusses the relationship between monotonic interpretation, Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990), and context change approaches to semantics.",

        "Constraints on legitimate scoping (Section 5) force +b and +h to take wide scope over both the antecedent and ellipsis.",
        "The sloppy reading results from re-indexing the ellipsis pronoun so that it has the same restriction and category as the original, but is resolved to +j and has a new index +hl.",
        "This corresponds to taking P1 to be: X-claim(X,clever(term(+hl,<lex=he>, male,exists,+j))).",

        "This seems to be sufficient to cover the range of examples treated by Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira (1991), but that is a specific linguistic claim about verb phrase ellipsis in English and not central to the present paper."

        "The emergent conditions on legitimate scoping are",
        "1.",
        "No term may be quantified-in more than once: The first application of the quantifier rule discharges the term.",

        "Then the quantification rule for R needs to be applied to the discharged formula, but the formula will not contain an occurrence of the term R, making the rule inapplicable.",
        "The last two constraints have often been attributed to restrictions on free variables and vacuous quantification.",

        "For anaphoric terms whose referent has been resolved to some individual constant, it does matter where the quantification rule is applied; since the term existentially quantifies over things identical to a single object, the scope of the quantification is immaterial.",
        "It is thus convenient to leave anaphoric terms like this unscoped in QLF.",
        "Although this makes the QLF look (syntactically) as though it is not fully resolved, semantically it is.",
        "For other unscoped terms, alternative applications of the quantifier rule may well lead to distinct truth conditions, and in these cases the QLF is genuinely unresolved.",
        "Context Dependence: Fully resolved QLFs are context-independent in the same sense that holds for closed formulas in traditional predicate logic (i.e. if the interpretation of the constant symbols in the language is fixed).",
        "Unresolved QLFs behave more like open formulas, and there is an analogy between assignments to unbound variables in predicate logic and possible resolutions of meta-variables admitted by the salience relation S. S(C,H) should be thought of as providing QLF expressions whose denotations are possible referents for unresolved expressions with category C. (It would have been possible to define S as a direct relation between categories and referents, but this complicates the statement of its role in resolution and in the semantic definitions.)",
        "We used S above in the definition of QLF semantics, but it is also central to NL processing: being able to compute S can clearly play an important role in the process of reference resolution during NL interpretation and in the process of building descriptions during NL synthesis.",

        "By contrast, the annotation of QLFs with scope lists provides an extra level of information about how the derivations proceed.",
        "In particular, they indicate which evaluation rules should be applied where.",
        "QLF thus provides a (usually partial) specification of a semantic derivation, showing (a) what the initial 'premises' are (roughly, lexical meanings, although these too may only be partially specified), and (b) the rules by which the 'premises' are combined.",
        "QLF resolution amounts to further instantiating this specification.",
        "This view of QLF can be contrasted with Logical Form as it is normally understood, which represents the results of carrying out a semantic derivation.",
        "The difference between specifying a derivation and carrying it out is what makes resolution order independent in monotonic interpretation.",
        "Making a resolution to QLF only specifies when and how an expression should be evaluated during semantic derivation; it does not carry out that part of the derivation.",
        "Where no distinction is drawn between making a resolution and carrying out the corresponding step of the derivation, the order of resolution can be important.",
        "Thus, for Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira (1991), where this distinction is not drawn, the precise interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution determines the interpretation of the sentence.",
        "In QLF, resolutions dictate the order in which various steps of the derivation are carried out, but the resolution order does not reflect the derivation order.",
        "Distinguishing between specifying and performing a derivation also means that a monotonic treatment of ellipsis resolution does not need to resort to higher-order unification.",
        "Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira use higher-order unification to 'unpick' the composition of constituent meanings obtained in the semantic derivation from the ellipsis antecedent.",
        "Some of these meanings are then put back together to produce a predicate that can be applied to the ellipsis arguments.",
        "Since monotonic resolution does not carry out the final composition of meanings, but merely sets out conditions on how it is to take place, there is no need to unpick composed meanings and put them back together again.",
        "It is worth pointing out that monotonic interpretation is compatible with approaches to meaning as a transition between contexts or information states, and where the order in which transitions are made is significant (e.g. Veltman 1991).",
        "In such a framework, monotonic interpretation would amount to making decisions about which transitions to take when, but would not involve putting those decisions into action.",
        "The monotonicity in",
        "monotonic interpretation thus refers to the way in which alternative derivations of sentence meanings may be chosen, but not to the semantic effects of those sentence meanings."

        "A description of the language processing mechanisms to which we have applied the monotonic semantics model is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "However, we believe that the QLF representation presented here brings significant advantages to implementing mechanisms for reference resolution, scoping, preference and generation.",
        "Reference and Scoping: The order independence of resolution operations allows for a variety of control structures in implementing a resolution mechanism.",
        "We find it convenient to make a bottom up pass through QLFs making reference resolutions, followed by a stage of scoping resolution, and to iterate over this should any of the resolutions introduce further unresolved expressions.",
        "The salience relation S can be implemented as procedures that search for properties, objects or indices in context.",
        "Scoping proceeds simply by the non-deterministic instantiation of scoping constraints, subject to the restrictions imposed on evaluable QLFs (Section 5), plus techniques for ignoring logically equivalent scopings, as for example described by Moran (1988).",
        "Preference and Disambiguation: A resolved QLF preserves all the information in the original unresolved QLF, and also records the correspondence between resolved and unresolved expressions.",
        "This makes it possible to define preference metrics that can be used for ranking alternative interpretations independently of the search strategies used to derive them.",
        "For example, in the case of scoping, these metrics can combine information about how far a quantifier was 'raised' with information about the surface form of its determiner.",
        "Preference ranking over alternative resolutions facilitates automatic disambiguation of input.",
        "Interactive disambiguation can make use of generation from resolved QLFs for confirmation by a user.",
        "Generation: There is a strong connection between monotonicity and reversibility in language processing systems.",
        "Monotonicity of unification means that algorithms such as head-driven generation (Shieber et a/ 1990) can be applied to grammars developed for analysis.",
        "We use a variant of this algorithm for generating from QLFs, and the monotonicity of semantic interpretation means that the grammar used for generating from unresolved QLFs (the normal 'output' of the grammar) can also be used for generation from resolved QLFs.",
        "In parallel to the distinction between grammatical analysis (of NL into unresolved QLFs) and interpretation, we make the distinction between grammatical synthesis (of NL from QLFs) and description.",
        "Description is the process of deriving a QLF from which synthesis proceeds by taking a fact (e.g. a database assertion) as input.",
        "We hope to report on our approach to description elsewhere.",
        "However, one of the principles of QLF-based description is that while interpretation instantiates referent fields in underspecified QLFs, description involves instantiating category and restriction fields for QLFs in which referent fields are already instantiated.",
        "The preference metrics applied to rank alternative interpretations can be applied equally well to ranking resolved QLFs produced by a nondeterministic description process, so there is a sense in which the preference mechanism can also be made reversible."
