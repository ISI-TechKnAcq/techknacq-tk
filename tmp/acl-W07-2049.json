        "This paper describes two systems entered in SemEval-2007 task #4: Classification of Semantic Relations between Nominals.",
        "A key contribution of this research is that we examine the compatibility of noun compound (NC) interpretation methods over the extended task of nominal classification, to gain empirical insight into the relative complexity of the two tasks.",
        "The goal of the nominal classification task is to identify the compatibility of a given semantic relation with each of a set of test nominal pairs, e.g. between climate and forest in the fragment the climate in the forest with respect to the CONTENT-CONTAINER relation.",
        "Semantic relations (or SRs) in nominals represent the underlying interpretation of the nominal, in the form of the directed relation between the two nominals.",
        "The proposed task is a generalisation of the more conventional task of interpreting noun compounds (NCs), in which we take a NC such as cookie jar and interpret it according to a predefined inventory of semantic relations (Levi, 1979; Vanderwende, 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998).",

        "Our approach to the task was to: (1) naively treat all nominal pairs as NCs (e.g. the climate in the forest is treated as an instance of climate forest); and (2) translate the individual binary classification tasks into a single multiclass classification task, in the interests of benchmarking existing SR interpretation methods over a common dataset.",
        "That is, we take all positive training instances for each SR and pool them together into a single training dataset.",
        "For each test instance, we make a prediction according to one of the seven relations in the task, which we then map onto a binary classification for final evaluation purposes.",
        "This mapping is achieved by determining which binary SR classification the test instance was sourced from, and returning a positive classification if the predicted SR coincides with the target SR, and a negative classification if not.",
        "We make three (deliberately naive) assumptions in our approach to the nominal interpretation task.",
        "First, we assume that all the positive training in",
        "stances correspond uniquely to the SR in question, despite the task organisers making it plain that there is semantic overlap between the SRs.",
        "As a machine learning task, this makes the task considerably more difficult, as the performance for the standard baselines drops considerably from that for the binary tasks.",
        "Second, we assume that each nominal pair maps onto a NC.",
        "This is clearly a misconstrual of the task, and intended to empirically validate whether such an approach is viable.",
        "In line with this assumption, we will refer to nominal pairs as NCs for the remainder of the paper.",
        "Third and finally, we assume that the SR annotation of each training and test instance is insensitive to the original context, and use only the constituent words in the NC to make our prediction.",
        "This is for direct comparability with earlier research, and we acknowledge that the context (and word sense) is a strong determinant of the SR in practice.",
        "Our aim in this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of general-purpose SR interpretation over the nominal classification task, and establish a new baseline for the task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "We present our methods in Section 2 and depict the system architectures in Section 4.",
