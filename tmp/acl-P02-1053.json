        "However, in this case, Google1 reports about 5,000 matches.",
        "It would be useful to know what fraction of these matches recommend Akumal as a travel destination.",
        "With an algorithm for automatically classifying a review as “thumbs up” or “thumbs down”, it would be possible for a search engine to report such summary statistics.",
        "This is the motivation for the research described here.",
        "Other potential applications include recognizing “flames” (abusive newsgroup messages) (Spertus, 1997) and developing new kinds of search tools (Hearst, 1992).",
        "In this paper, I present a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying a review as recommended or not recommended.",
        "The algorithm takes a written review as input and produces a classification as output.",
        "The first step is to use a part-of-speech tagger to identify phrases in the input text that contain adjectives or adverbs (Brill, 1994).",
        "The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of each extracted phrase (Hatzivassi-loglou & McKeown, 1997).",
        "A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “romantic ambience”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “horrific events”).",
        "The third step is to assign the given review to a class, recommended or not recommended, based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases extracted from the review.",
        "If the average is positive, the prediction is that the review recommends the item it discusses.",
        "Otherwise, the prediction is that the item is not recommended.",
        "The PMI-IR algorithm is employed to estimate the semantic orientation of a phrase (Turney, 2001).",
        "PMI-IR uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words or phrases.",
        "The se",
        "mantic orientation of a given phrase is calculated by comparing its similarity to a positive reference word (“excellent”) with its similarity to a negative reference word (“poor”).",
        "More specifically, a phrase is assigned a numerical rating by taking the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “excellent” and subtracting the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “poor”.",
        "In addition to determining the direction of the phrase’s semantic orientation (positive or negative, based on the sign of the rating), this numerical rating also indicates the strength of the semantic orientation (based on the magnitude of the number).",
        "The algorithm is presented in Section 2.",
        "Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) have also developed an algorithm for predicting semantic orientation.",
        "Their algorithm performs well, but it is designed for isolated adjectives, rather than phrases containing adjectives or adverbs.",
        "This is discussed in more detail in Section 3, along with other related work.",
        "The classification algorithm is evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions2, randomly sampled from four different domains: reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations.",
        "Reviews at Epinions are not written by professional writers; any person with a Web browser can become a member of Epinions and contribute a review.",

        "(*) The tax proposal was simplistic and well-received by the public.",
        "The third sentence is incorrect, because we use “and” with adjectives that have the same semantic orientation (“simple” and “well-received” are both positive), but we use “but” with adjectives that have different semantic orientations (“simplistic” is negative).",

        "2.",
        "A supervised learning algorithm combines multiple sources of evidence to label pairs of adjectives as having the same semantic orientation or diferent semantic orientations.",

        "3.",
        "A clustering algorithm processes the graph structure to produce two subsets of adjectives, such that links across the two subsets are mainly different-orientation links, and links inside a subset are mainly same-orientation links.",
        "4.",
        "Since it is known that positive adjectives tend to be used more frequently than negative adjectives, the cluster with the higher average frequency is classified as having positive semantic orientation.",
        "This algorithm classifies adjectives with accuracies ranging from 78% to 92%, depending on the amount of training data that is available.",
        "The algorithm can go beyond a binary positive-negative distinction, because the clustering algorithm (step 3 above) can produce a “goodness-of-fit” measure that indicates how well an adjective fits in its assigned cluster.",
        "Although they do not consider the task of classifying reviews, it seems their algorithm could be plugged into the classification algorithm presented in Section 2, where it would replace PMI-IR and equation (3) in the second step.",
        "However, PMI-IR is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and it can handle phrases and adverbs, in addition to isolated adjectives.",
        "As far as I know, the only prior published work on the task of classifying reviews as thumbs up or down is Tong’s (2001) system for generating sentiment timelines.",
        "This system tracks online discussions about movies and displays a plot of the number of positive sentiment and negative sentiment messages over time.",
        "Messages are classified by looking for specific phrases that indicate the sentiment of the author towards the movie (e.g., “great acting”, “wonderful visuals”, “terrible score”, “uneven editing”).",

        "In several of these applications, the first step is to recognize that the text is subjective and then the natural second step is to determine the semantic orientation of the subjective text.",
        "For example, a flame detector cannot merely detect that a newsgroup message is subjective, it must further detect that the message has a negative semantic orientation; otherwise a message of praise could be classified as a flame.",
        "Hearst (1992) observes that most search engines focus on finding documents on a given topic, but do not allow the user to specify the directionality of the documents (e.g., is the author in favor of, neutral, or opposed to the event or item discussed in the document?).",
        "The directionality of a document is determined by its deep argumentative structure, rather than a shallow analysis of its adjectives.",
        "Sentences are interpreted metaphorically in terms of agents exerting force, resisting force, and overcoming resistance.",

        "A natural question, given the preceding results, is what makes movie reviews hard to classify?",
        "Table 6 shows that classification by the average SO tends to err on the side of guessing that a review is not recommended, when it is actually recommended.",
        "This suggests the hypothesis that a good movie will often contain unpleasant scenes (e.g., violence, death, mayhem), and a recommended movie review may thus have its average semantic orientation reduced if it contains descriptions of these unpleasant scenes.",
        "However, if we add a constant value to the average SO of the movie reviews, to compensate for this bias, the accuracy does not improve.",
        "This suggests that, just as positive reviews mention unpleasant things, so negative reviews often mention pleasant scenes.",
        "to this hypothesis.",
        "For example, the phrase “more evil” does have negative connotations, thus an SO of -4.384 is appropriate, but an evil character does not make a bad movie.",
        "The difficulty with movie reviews is that there are two aspects to a movie, the events and actors in the movie (the elements of the movie), and the style and art of the movie (the movie as a gestalt; a unified whole).",
        "This is likely also the explanation for the lower accuracy of the Cancun reviews: good beaches do not necessarily add up to a good vacation.",
        "On the other hand, good automotive parts usually do add up to a good automobile and good banking services add up to a good bank.",
        "It is not clear how to address this issue.",
        "Future work might look at whether it is possible to tag sentences as discussing elements or wholes.",
        "Another area for future work is to empirically compare PMI-IR and the algorithm of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).",

        "On the other hand, it would be interesting to evaluate PMI-IR on the collection of 1,336 hand-labeled adjectives that were used in the experiments of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).",
        "A related question for future work is the relationship of accuracy of the estimation of semantic orientation at the level of individual phrases to accuracy of review classification.",
        "Since the review classification is based on an average, it might be quite resistant to noise in the SO estimate for individual phrases.",

        "In experiments with 410 reviews from Epinions, the algorithm attains an average accuracy of 74%.",
        "It appears that movie reviews are difficult to classify, because the whole is not necessarily the sum of the parts; thus the accuracy on movie reviews is about 66%.",
        "On the other hand, for banks and automobiles, it seems that the whole is the sum of the parts, and the accuracy is 80% to 84%.",
        "Travel reviews are an intermediate case.",
        "Previous work on determining the semantic orientation of adjectives has used a complex algorithm that does not readily extend beyond isolated adjectives to adverbs or longer phrases (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).",
        "The simplicity of PMI-IR may encourage further work with semantic orientation.",
        "The limitations of this work include the time required for queries and, for some applications, the level of accuracy that was achieved.",
        "The former difficulty will be eliminated by progress in hardware.",
        "The latter difficulty might be addressed by using semantic orientation combined with other features in a supervised classification algorithm."
