        "We will discuss the analysis of English expressions consisting of a head noun preceded by one or more open-class specifiers: rising prices, horse blanket, mushroom omelet, banana bread, parish priest, gurgle detector, quarterback sneak, blind spot, red herring, bachelor's degree, Planck's constant, Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Washington's birthday sale, error correction code logic, steel industry collective bargaining agreement, expensive toxic waste cleanup, windshield wiper blade replacement, computer communications network performance analysis primer, and so forth.",
        "For brevity, we will call such expressions `nominals.'",
        "Our main aim is an algorithm for assigning stress patterns to such nominal expressions; we will also discuss methods for parsing them.",
        "Nominals are hard to parse, since their pre-terminal string is usually consistent with all possible constituent structures, so that we seem to need an analysis of the relative plausibility of the various meanings (Marcus, 1980; Finin, 1980).",
        "Even when the constituent structure is known (as trivially in the case of binary nominals), nominal stress patterns are hard to predict, and also seem to depend on meaning (Bolinger, 1972; Fudge, 1984; Selkirk, 1984).",
        "This is a serious problem for text-to-speech algorithms, since nominal expressions are common at the ends of phrases, and the location of a phrase's last accent has a large effect on its sound.",
        "Complex nominals are common in most kinds of text; for example, in the million words of the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kueera, 1982), there are over 75,000 nominals containing more than two words.",
        "However, we have been able to make some progress on the problems of parsing and stress assignment for nominals in unrestricted text.",
        "This paper concentrates on the representation and use of knowledge relevant to the problem of assigning stress; this same knowledge turns out to be useful in parsing.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we will be dealing with nominals in contexts where the default stress pattern is not shifted by phenomena such as as intonational focus or contrastive stress, exemplified below: (1) a.",
        "We're only interested in solvable problems.",

        "These interesting phenomena rarely' shift main phrase stress in expository text, and are",
        "best seen as a modulation of the null-hypothesis stress patterns.",
        "argue here for this point of view, but some illustrative examples may help make our position clearer.",
        "We have argued elsewhere (Liberman and Sproat, 1987) for the following positions: (i) the syntax of modification is quite free – various modifiers of nominal heads (including adjectives, nouns, and possessives) may occur as sisters of any X-bar projection of the nominal head; (ii) modification at different X-bar levels expresses different types of meaning relations (see also Jackendoff, 1973); (iii) the English nominal system includes many special constructions that do not conform to the usual specifier-head patterns, such as complex names, time and date expressions, and so forth; (iv) the default stress pattern depends on the syntactic structure.",
        "Points (ii) and (iv) are common opinions in the linguistic literature.",
        "In particular, we support generative phonology's traditional view of phrasal stress rules, which is that structures of category N° have the pattern assigned by the compound stress rule, which makes left-hand subconstituents stress-dominant unless their right-hand sisters are lexically complex.2 In simple binary cases, this amounts to left-hand stress.",
        "All other structures are (recursively) right stressed, according to what is called the nuclear stress rule.3 Points (i) and (iii) are less commonplace.",
        "They make it impossible to predict stress from the preterminal string of a binary nominal, since the left-hand element may be attached at any bar level, or may be involved in some special construction.",
        "We do not have space to 2.",
        "Various authors (e.g. Liberman & Prince 1977, Hayes 1980) have suggested that the behavior of the compound stress rule, which in fact applies to compound nouns but not to compound adjectives or verbs, is related to the tendency of non-compound English nouns to have their main stress one syllable farther back than equivalent verbs or adjectives.",
        "This generalization strengthens the argument that [11 1■11 constituents with left-hand stress are of parent category No.",
        "3.",
        "See Chomsky and Halle (1968), Liberman and Prince (1977), Hayes (1980) for various versions of these rules."

        "The N° status of e.g. user's manual can be seen by its stress pattern as well as its willingness to occur inside quantifiers and adjectives: three new user's manuals, but *three new John's books.",
        "In addition, there are several classes of possessive phrases that take right-hand stress but pattern distributionally like adjectives, i.e. occur at NI level, as in three Kirtland' s Warblers.",

        "[Morning prayers], which follows the regular pattern, is stressed correctly by the program.",
        "Similarly, [Easter Bunny] is listed as taking left stress whereas [Easter feast] is correctly stressed on the right.",
        "There is a common misconception to the effect that all and only the lexicalized (i.e. listed) nominal expressions are left-stressed.",
        "This is false: lexicalization is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for left stress.",

        "The word supply is not nearly so close to the core examples of likely arguments for control.",
        "Of course, listed complex nominals straightforwardly aid in parsing: a nominal such as City Hall parking lot is fairly easy to analyze given that in any case City Hall and parking lot are in our phrasal lexicon.",
        "It seems clear that substantial amounts of lexical knowledge are necessary to parse complex nominals.",
