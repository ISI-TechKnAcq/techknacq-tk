        "Within the computational discourse community, there is a long-standing debate between proponents of theories based on domain-independent rhetorical relations (most notably Rhetorical Structure Theory, Mann and Thompson 1988, henceforth RST; see also Hobbs 1985) and those who subscribe to theories based on intentionality (most notably that of Grosz and Sidner 1986, henceforth G&S).",
        "While some researchers have tried to integrate the two approaches (Moore and Paris 1993; Asher and Lascarides 1994; Hobbs 1993), the two are usually viewed as competing theories.",
        "Here we argue that G&S and RST are essentially similar in what they say about how speakers' intentions determine a structure of their discourse.",
        "Intentional structure describes the roles that discourse actions play in the speaker's communicative plan to achieve desired effects on the hearer's mental state.",
        "Intentions encode what the speaker was trying to accomplish with a given portion of discourse.",
        "The relations between intentions indicate whether one intention contributes to the satisfaction of another (dominance) or whether one intention must be satisfied before another (satisfaction-precedence) (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "In contrast, informational structure is concerned with domain relations among the things being talked about.",
        "Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both intentional and informational analyses are needed simultaneously.",
        "Prior research has established that recognition of intentional structure, and therefore appropriate generation of cues to such structure, is crucial for many discourse-processing tasks.",

        "Hirschberg et al.",
        "(1987) show that intentional structure plays a role in intonation.",
        "In addition, Moore (1995, in press) shows that intentional structure is crucial for responding effectively to questions that refer to prior discourse and to communication failures.",
        "Further research indicates that intentional structure is an important factor in determining when to generate discourse cues (e.g., \"because,\" \"thus,\" \"although\"), which discourse cues to select, and where to place those cues (Moser and Moore 1995, in preparation).",
        "In this paper, we compare what G&S and RST say about intentional structure.",
        "We use the term Intentional Linguistic Structure, or ILS, as a theory-neutral way of referring to the structure of a discourse determined by the speaker's intentions.",
        "The definition of ILS comprises one of the major claims in G&S. ILS is not directly addressed in RST, but is implicit in the RST concept of nuclearity.",
        "We argue that the key to reconciling ILS in the two theories lies in the correspondence between the dominance relation between intentions in G&S and the nucleus:satellite relation between text spans in RST.",
        "Roughly speaking, an RST nucleus expresses a G&S intention I„, a satellite expresses another intention Is and, in G&S terms, I, dominates I.",
        "The correspondence between G&S dominance and RST nuclearity helps to clarify the relationship between ILS and informational structure, the structure determined by underlying semantic (domain) relations.",
        "In particular, the undesirable possibility that informational structure could be incompatible with intentional structure (Moore and Pollack 1992) is explained.",
        "Further, we argue that a synthesis of G&S and RST is possible because the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity forms a great deal of common ground, and because the remaining claims in the two theories are consistent."

        "As shown on the left in Figure 1, Io dominates II, which in turn dominates 12.",
        "Due to these dominance relations, the discourse segment that realizes 12 is embedded in the discourse segment for Ii, which is in turn embedded within the discourse segment for Io, as shown on the right in the figure.",

        "Most likely, the core of the segment is found in these unembedded utterances.",
        "In the example, (a) is the core of DS°, (b) the core of DS1 and (c) the core of DS2.",

        "Because nuclearity can only be determined by consideration of intentions, and intentional and informational analyses of a discourse must co-exist, we argue that the solution to the problem is to properly relegate information about nuclearity (intention dominance) to the intentional analysis, and remove it from definitions of informational relations.",
        "In this way, these two determinants of discourse structure cannot conflict.",
        "In addition, note that this is preferable to adding surplus informational relations to allow either relatum to be the nucleus (as was done in the volitional-cause and volitional-result case) because (1) this obscures the fact that relations such as volitional-cause and volitional-result appeal to the same underlying domain relation and (2) the proliferation of relations weakens the restrictive power of the framework."
