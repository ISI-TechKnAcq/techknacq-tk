        "Coreference resolvers are typically evaluated on collections of news articles that cover a wide range of topics, such as the ACE (ACE03, 2003; ACE04, 2004; ACE05, 2005) and OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007) data sets.",
        "Many NLP applications, however, involve text analysis for specialized domains, such as clinical medicine (Gooch and Roudsari, 2012; Glinos, 2011), legal text analysis (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2009), and biological literature (Batista-Navarro and Ananiadou, 2011; Castan?o et al., 2002).",
        "Learning-based coreference resolvers can be easily retrained for a specialized domain given annotated training texts for that domain.",
        "However, we found that retraining an off-the-shelf coreference resolver with domain-specific texts showed little benefit.",
        "This surprising result led us to question the nature of the feature sets used by noun phrase (NP) coreference resolvers.",
        "Nearly all of the features employed by recent systems fall into three categories: string match and word overlap, syntactic properties (e.g., appositives, predicate nominals, parse features, etc.",
        "), and semantic matching (e.g., gender agreement, WordNet similarity, named entity classes, etc.).",
        "Conspicuously absent from most systems are lexical features that allow the classifier to consider the specific words when making a coreference decision.",
        "A few researchers have experimented with lexical features, but they achieved mixed results in evaluations on broad-coverage corpora (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Bjo?rkelund and Nugues, 2011; Rahman and Ng, 2011a).",
        "We hypothesized that lexicalized features can have a more substantial impact in domain-specific settings.",
        "Lexical features can capture domain-specific knowledge and subtle semantic distinctions that may be important within a domain.",
        "For example, based on the resolutions found in domain-specific training sets, our lexicalized features captured the knowledge that ?tomcat?",
        "can be coreferent with ?plane?, ?UAW?",
        "can be coreferent with ?union?, and ?anthrax?",
        "can be coreferent with ?diagnosis?.",
        "Capturing these types of domain-specific information is often impossible using only general-purpose resources.",
        "For example, WordNet defines ?tomcat?",
        "only as an animal, does not contain an entry for ?UAW?, and categorizes ?anthrax?",
        "and ?diagnosis?",
        "very differently.1 In this paper, we evaluate the impact of lexicalized features on 4 domains: management succession (MUC-6 data), vehicle launches (MUC-7 data), disease outbreaks (ProMed texts), and terrorism (MUC-4 data).",
        "We incorporate lexicalized feature sets into two different coreference architectures: Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), a pairwise coreference classifier, and Sieve (Raghu-nathan et al., 2010), a rule-based system.",
        "Our results show that lexicalized features significantly improve performance in all four domains and in both types of coreference architectures."

        "Ng (2007) used lexical information to assess the likelihood of a noun phrase being anaphoric, but this did not show clear improvements on ACE data.",
        "There has been previous work on domain-specific coreference resolution for several domains, including biological literature (Castan?o et al., 2002; Liang and Lin, 2005; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008; Kim et al., 2011; Batista-Navarro and Ananiadou, 2011), clinical medicine (He, 2007; Zheng et al., 2011; Glinos, 2011; Gooch and Roudsari, 2012) and legal documents (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2009).",
