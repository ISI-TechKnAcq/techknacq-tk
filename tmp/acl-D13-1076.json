        "One strand of work in dialog research targets the rapid prototyping of virtual humans capable of conducting a conversation with humans in the context of a virtual world.",
        "In particular, question answering (QA) characters can respond to a restricted set of topics after training on a set of dialogs whose utterances are annotated with dialogue acts (Leuski and Traum, 2008).",
        "As argued in (Sagae et al., 2009), the size of the training corpus is a major factor in allowing QA characters that are both robust and accurate.",
        "In addition, the training corpus should arguably be of good quality in that (i) it should contain the various ways of expressing the same content (paraphrases) and (ii) the data should not be skewed.",
        "In sum, the ideal training data should be large (more data is better data) ; balanced (similar amount of data for each class targeted by the classifier) and varied (it should encompass the largest possible number of paraphrases and synonyms for the utterances of each class).",
        "In this paper, we explore different ways of improving and complementing the training data of a supervised QA character.",
        "We expand the size and the quality (less skewed data) of the training corpus using paraphrase generation techniques.",
        "We compare the performance obtained on lemmatised vs. non lemmatised data.",
        "And we investigate how various resources (synonym dictionaries, WordNet, distributional neighbours) can be used to handle unseen words at run time."

        "Dialog Systems For our experiments, we use a hybrid dialog system similar to that described in (Rojas Barahona et al., 2012b; Rojas Barahona and Gardent, 2012).",
        "This system combines a classifier for interpreting the players utterances with an information state dialog manager which selects an appropriate system response based on the dialog move assigned by the classifier to the user turn.",
        "The classifier is a logistic regression classifier 1 which was trained for each subdialog in the game.",
        "The features used for training are the set of content words which are associated with a given dialog move and which remain after TF*IDF 2 filtering.",
        "Note that in this experiment, we do not use contextual features such as the dialog acts labeling the previous turns.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "First, we want to focus on the impact of synonym handling, paraphrasing and lem-matisation on dialog management.",
        "Removing contextual features allows us to focus on how content features (content words) can be improved by these mechanisms.",

        "As we shall see below, performance decreases in this second evaluation suggesting that subjects produce different turns when playing with a computer than with a human thereby inducing a weak out-of-domain effect and negatively impacting classification.",
        "Evaluation on the H-H corpus therefore gives a measure of how well the techniques explored help improving the dialog engine when used in a real life setting.",
        "Correspondingly, we use two different tests for measuring statistical significance.",
        "In the H-H evaluation, significance is computed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test because data are dependent and are not assumed to be normally distributed.",
        "When building the testset we took care of not including paraphrases of utterances in the training partition (for each paraphrase generated automatically we keep track of the original utterance), however utterances in both datasets might be generated by the same subject, since a subject completed 12 distinct dialogues during the game.",
        "Conversely, in the H-C evaluation, training (H-H data) and test (H-C data) sets were collected under different conditions with different subjects therefore significance was computed using the McNemar sign-test (Dietterich, 1998)."

        "We also compare the results obtained when evaluating using 10-fold cross validation on the training data (H-H dialogs) vs. evaluating the performance of the system on H-C interactions.",
        "Overall Impact The largest performance gain is obtained by a combination of the three techniques explored in this paper namely, data expansion, synonym handling and lemmatisation (+8.9 points for the cross-validation experiment and +2.3 for the H-C evaluation).",
        "Impact of Lexical Substitution at Run Time Because of space restrictions, we do not report here the results obtained using lexical resources without lemmatisation.",
        "However, we found that lexical resources are only useful when combined with lemmatisation.",
        "This is unsurprising since synonym dictionaries and EuroWordNet only contain lemmas.",
        "Indeed when distributional neighbours are used, lemmatisation has little impact (e.g., 65.11% using distributional neighbours without lemmatisation on the H-H corpus without paraphrases vs. 66.41% when using lemmatisation).",
        "Another important issue when searching for a word synonym concerns lexical disambiguation : the synonym used to replace an unknown word should capture the meaning of that word in its given context.",
        "We tried using a language model trained on the training corpus to choose between synonym candidates (i.e., selecting the synonym yielding the highest sentence probability when substituting that synonym for the unknown word) but did not obtain a significant improvement.",
        "In contrast, it is noticeable that synonym handling has a higher impact when using EuroWordNet as a lexical resource.",
        "Since EuroWordNet contain categorial information while the synonym dictionaries we used do not, this suggests that the categorial disambiguation provided by TreeTagger helps identifying an appropriate synonym in EuroWordNet.",
        "Finally, it is clear that the lexical resources used for this experiment are limited in coverage and quality.",
        "We observed in particular that some words which are very frequent in the training data (and thus which could be used to replace unknown words) do not occur in the synonym dictionaries.",
        "For instance when using paraphrases and dictionaries (fourth row and",
        "(p < 0.005) used for the HH corpus and the McNemar test (p < 0.005) for the HC corpus.",
        "fourth column in Table 2) 50% of the unknown words were solved, 17% were illformed and 33% remained unsolved.",
        "To compensate this deficiency, we tried combining the three lexical resources in various ways (taking the union or combining them in a pipeline using the first resource that would yield a synonym).",
        "However the results did not improve and even in some cases worsened due probably to the insufficient lexical disambiguation.",
        "Interestingly, the results show that paraphrases always improves synonym handling presumably because it increases the size of the known vocabulary thereby increasing the possibility of finding a known synonym.",
        "In sum, synonym handling helps most when (i) words are lemmatised and (ii) unknown words can be at least partially (i.e., using POS tag information) disambiguated.",
        "Moreover since data expansion increases the set of known words available as potential synonyms for unknown words, combining synonym handling with data expansion further improves accuracy.",
        "Impact of Lemmatisation When evaluating using cross validation on the training corpus, lemmatisation increases accuracy by up to 3.42 points indicating that unseen word forms negatively impact accuracy.",
        "Noticeably however, lemmatisation has no significant impact when evaluating on the H-C corpus.",
        "This in turn suggests that the lower accuracy obtained on the H-C corpus results not from unseen word forms but from unseen lemmas.",
        "Impact of Paraphrases On the H-H corpus, data expansion has no significant impact when used alone.",
        "However it yields an increase of up to 8.27 points and in fact, has a statistically significant impact, for all configurations involving lemmatisation.",
        "Thus, data expansion is best used in combination with lemmatisation and their combination permits creating better, more balanced and more general training data.",
        "On the H-C corpus however, the impact is negative or insignificant suggesting that the decrease in performance on the H-C corpus is due to content words that are new with respect to the training data i.e., content words for which neither a synonym nor a lemma can be found in the expanded training data.",
        "Conclusion While classifiers are routinely trained on dialog data to model the dialog management process, the impact of such basic factors as lemmatisation, automatic data expansion and synonym handling has remained largely unexplored.",
        "The empirical evaluation described here suggests that each of these factors can help improve performance but that the impact will vary depending on their combination and on the evaluation mode.",
        "Combining all three techniques yields the best results.",
        "We conjecture that there are two main reasons for this.",
        "First, synonym handling is best used in combination with POS tagging and lemmatisation because these supports partial lexical semantic disambiguation.",
        "Second, data expansion permits expanding the set of known words thereby increasing the possibility of finding a known synonym to replace an unknown word with."
