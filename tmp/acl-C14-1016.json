        "Distributed word representations usually refer to low dimensional and dense real value vectors (a.k.a.",
        "word embeddings) to represent words, which are assumed to convey semantic information contained in words.",
        "With the exploding text data on the Web and fast development of deep neural network technolo-gies, distributed word embeddings have been effectively trained and widely used in a lot of text mining tasks (Bengio et al., 2003) (Morin and Bengio, 2005) (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) (Collobert et al., 2011) (Mikolov et al., 2010) (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "While word embedding plays an increasingly important role in many tasks, most of word embedding models, which assume one embedding vector for each individual word, suffer from a critical limitation for modeling tremendous polysemous words (e.g. bank, left, doctor).",
        "Using the same embedding vector to represent the different meanings (we will call prototype of a word in the rest of the paper) of a polysemous word is somehow unreasonable and sometimes it even hurts the model's expression ability.",
        "To address this problem, some recent efforts, such as (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) (Huang et al., 2012), have investigated how to obtain multi embedding vectors for the respective different prototypes of a polysemous word.",
        "Specifically, these works usually take a two-step approach: they first train single prototype word representations through a multi-layer neural network with the assumption that one word only yields single word embedding; then, they identify multi word embeddings for each polysemous word by clustering all its context window features, which are usually computed as the average of single prototype embeddings of its neighboring words in the context window.",
        "Compared with traditional single prototype model, these models have demonstrated significant improvements in many semantic natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "However, they suffer from a This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "151 crucial restriction in terms of scalability when facing exploding training text corpus, mainly due to the deep layers and huge amounts of parameters in the neural networks in these models.",
        "Moreover, the performance of these multi-prototype models is quite sensitive to the clustering algorithm and requires much effort in clustering implementation and parameter tuning.",
        "The lack of probabilistic explanation also refrains clustering based methods from being applied to many text mining tasks, such as language modeling.",
        "To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a new probabilistic multi-prototype model and integrate it into a highly efficient continuous Skip-Gram model, which was recently introduced in the well-known Word2Vec toolkit (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "Compared with conventional neural network language models which usually set up a multi-layer neural network, Word2Vec merely leverages a three-layer neural network to learn word embeddings, resulting in greatly decreased number of parameters and largely increased scalability.",
        "However, similar to most of existing word embedding models, Word2Vec also assumes one embedding for one word.",
        "We break this limitation by introducing a new probabilistic framework which employs hidden variables to indicate which prototype each word belongs to in the context.",
        "In this framework, the conditional probability of observing word w O conditioned on the presence of neighboring word w I (i.e. P(w O |w I )) can be formulated as a mixture model, where mixtures corresponds to w I 's different prototypes.",
        "This is a more natural way to define P(w O |w I ), since it has taken the polysemy of word w I into consideration.",
        "After defining the model, we design an efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn various word embedding vectors corresponding to each of w I 's prototypes.",
        "Evaluations on widely used word similarity tasks demonstrate that our algorithm produces comparable or even better word embeddings compared with either clustering-based multi-prototype models or the original Skip-Gram model.",
        "Furthermore, as a unified way to obtain multi word embeddings, our proposed method can effectively avoid the sensitivity to the clustering algorithm applied by previous multi-prototype word embedding approach.",
        "The following of the paper is organized as follows: we introduce related work in Section 2.",
        "Then, Section 3 describes our new model and algorithm in details and conducts a comparison in terms of complexity between our algorithm and the previous method.",
        "We present our experimental results in Section 4.",
        "The paper is concluded in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work Since the initial work (Bengio et al., 2003), there have been quite a lot of neural network based models to obtain distributed word representations (Morin and Bengio, 2005) (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) (Mikolov et al., 2010) (Collobert et al., 2011) (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "Most of these models assume that one word has only one embedding, except the work of Eric Huang (Huang et al., 2012), in which the authors propose to leverage global context information and multi-prototype embeddings to achieve performance gains in word similarity task.",
        "To obtain multi-prototype word embeddings, this work conducts clustering on a word's all context words?",
        "features in the corpus.",
        "The features are the embedding vectors trained previously via a three-layer neural network.",
        "Each cluster's centroid is regarded as the embedding vector for each prototype.",
        "Their reported experimental results verify the importance of considering multi-prototype models.",
        "Note that (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) also proposes to deal with the word polysemy problem by assigning to each prototype a real value vector.",
        "However their embedding vectors are obtained through a tf-idf counting model, which is usually called as distributional representations (Turian et al., 2010), rather than through a neural network.",
        "Therefore, we do not regard their paper as very related to our work.",
        "The similar statement holds for other works on vector model for word meaning in context such as (Erk and Pad√≥, 2008) (Thater et al., 2011) (Reddy et al., 2011) (Van de Cruys et al., 2011).",
        "Our model is mainly based on the recent proposed Word2Vec model, more concretely, the continuous Skip-Gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013a) (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "The continuous Skip-Gram model specifies the probability of observing the context words conditioned on the central word w I in the window via a three-layer neural network.",
        "With less parameters to train (thus higher scalability), Word2Vec discovers interesting analogical semantic relations between words like Japan Tokyo = France Paris.",
        "152 3 Model Description In this section, we introduce our algorithm for learning multi-prototype embeddings in details.",
        "In partic-ular, since our new model is based on the continuous Skip-Gram model, we first make a brief introduction to the Skip-Gram model.",
        "Then, we present our new multi-prototype algorithm and how we integrate it into the Skip-Gram model.",
        "After that, we propose an EM algorithm to conduct the training process.",
        "We also conduct a comparison on the number of parameters between the new EM algorithm and the state-of-the-art multi-prototype model proposed in (Huang et al., 2012), which can illustrate the efficiency superior of our algorithm.",
        "3.1 Multi-Prototype Skip-Gram Model In contrast to the conventional ways of using context words to predict the next word or the central word, the Skip-Gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) aims to leverage the central word to predict its context words.",
        "Specifically, assuming that the central word is w I and one of its neighboring word is w O , P(w O |w I ) is modeled in the following way: P(w O |w I ) = exp(V T w I U w O ) ?",
        "w?W exp(V T w I U w ) , (1) where W denotes the dictionary consisting of all words, U w ?R d and V w ?R d represent the d-dimensional ?output?",
        "and ?input?",
        "embedding vectors of word w, respectively.",
        "Note that all the parameters to be learned are the input and output embedding vectors of all words, i.e. U = {U w |w ?W} and V = {V w |w ?W}.",
        "This corresponds to a three-layer neural network, in which U and V denote the two parameter matrices of the neural network.",
        "Compared with the conventional neural networks employed in the literature which yield at least four layers (including the look-up table layer), the Skip-Gram model greatly reduces the number of parameters and thus gives rise to a significant improvement in terms of training efficiency.",
        "Our proposed Multi-Prototype Skip-Gram model is similar to the original Skip-Gram model in that it also aims to model P(w O |w I ) and uses two matrices (the input and output embedding matrices) as the parameters.",
        "The difference lies in that given word w I , the occurrence of word w O is described as a finite mixture model, in which each mixture corresponds to a prototype of word w I .",
        "To be specific, suppose that word w has N w prototypes and it appears in its h w -th prototype, i.e., h w ?",
        "{1, ?",
        "?",
        "?",

        "R d refers to the embedding vector of w I 's i-th prototype.",
        "This equation states that P(w O |w I ) is a weighted average of the probabilities of observing w O conditioned on the appearance of w I 's every prototype.",
        "The probability P(w O |h w I = i,w I ) takes the similar softmax form to equation (1) and the weight is specified as a prior probability of word w I falls in its every prototype.",
        "The general idea behind the Multi-Prototype Skip-Gram model is very intuitive: the surrounding words under different prototypes of the same word are usually different.",
        "For example, when the word bank refers to the side of a river, it is very possible to observe the corresponding context words such as river, water, and slope; however, when bank falls into the meaning of the financial organization, the surrounding word set is likely to be comprised of quite different words, such as money, account, and investment.",
        "The probability formulation in (3) brings much computation cost because of the linear dependency of |W | in the denominator ?",
        "w?W exp(U T w V w I ,i ).",
        "To address this issue, several efficient methods have been proposed such as Hierarchical Softmax Tree (Morin and Bengio, 2005) (Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013) and Negative Sampling (Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013) (Mikolov et al., 2013b).",

        "{?1,+1} L w O specifying a path from the root of the tree to leaf w O , where L w O is the length of vector b (w O ) .",

        "Smaller batch size yields more frequent updates of parameters, and thus avoids trapping in local optima, while larger batch size, associated with more infrequent parameter updating, may cause higher probability to encounter local optima.",
        "In our experiments, we observe that only one iteration of E-Step and M-Step can reach the embedding vectors with good enough performance on the word similarity task, whereas increasing the iteration number just leads to slight performance improvement with much longer training time.",
        "Under the above configuration, our model runs about three times faster than EHModel.",
        "4.2 Case Study This section gives some qualitative evaluations of our model by demonstrating how our model can effectively identify multi-prototype word embeddings on some specific cases.",
        "In Table 2, we list several polysemous words.",
        "For each word, we pick some of their prototypes learned by our model, including the prototype prior probability (i.e. pi i introduced in Section 3.2) and three of the most similar words with each prototype, respectively.",
        "The similarity is calculated by the cosine similarity score between the embedding vectors.",
        "From the table we can observe some interesting results of the multi-prototype embedding vectors produced by our model: ?",
        "For a polysemous word, its different embedding vectors represent its different semantic meanings.",
        "For example, the first embedding vector of the word apple corresponds to its sense as a kind of fruit, whereas the second one represents its meaning as an IT company.",
        "?",
        "The prior probability reflects the likelihood of the occurrence of various prototypes to some extent.",
        "For example, the word cell is more likely to represent the meaning of the smallest part of living structure (with probability 0.81), than to be used as the meaning of cellphone (with probability 156 Word Prior Probability Most Similar Words apple 1 0.82 strawberry, cherry, blueberry apple 2 0.17 iphone, macintosh, microsoft bank 1 0.15 river, canal, waterway bank 2 0.6 citibank, jpmorgan, bancorp bank 3 0.25 stock, exchange, banking cell 1 0.09 phones, cellphones, mobile cell 2 0.81 protein, tissues, lysis cell 3 0.01 locked, escape, handcuffed Table 2: Most similar words with different prototypes of the same word 0.09) or prisoned (with probability 0.01).",
        "Note that the three prior probability scores of cell do not sum to 1.",
        "The reason is that there are some other embeddings not presented in the table which are found to have high similarities with the three embeddings.",
        "We do not present them due to the space limitation.",
        "?",
        "By setting the prototype number to a fairly large value (e.g. N w = 10), the model tends to learn more fine-grained separations of the word's different meanings.",
        "For example, we can observe from Table 2 that the second and the third prototypes of the word bank seem similar to each other as both of them denote a financial concept.",
        "However, there are subtle differences between them: the second prototype represents concrete banks, such as citibank and jpmorgan, whereas the third one denotes what is done in the banks, since it is most similar to the words stock, exchange, and banking.",
        "We believe that such a fine-grained separation will bring more expressiveness to the multi-prototype word embeddings learned by our model.",
        "4.3 Results on Word Similarity in Context Dataset In this subsection, we give quantitative comparison of our method with conventional word embedding models, including Word2Vec and EHModel (Huang et al., 2012).",
        "The task we perform is the word similarity evaluation introduced in (Huang et al., 2012).",
        "Word similarity tasks evaluate a model's performance by calculating the Spearman's rank correlation between the ranking of ground truth similarity scores (given by human labeling) and the ranking based on the similarity scores produced by the model.",
        "Traditional word similarity tasks such as WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) and RG (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) are not suitable for evaluating multi-prototype models since there is neither enough number of polysemous words in these datasets nor context information to infer the prototype index.",
        "To address this issue, a new word similarity benchmark dataset including context information was released in (Huang et al., 2012).",
        "Following (Luong et al., 2013), we use SCWS to denote this dataset.",
        "Similar to WordSim353, SCWS contains some word pairs (concretely, 2003 pairs), together with human labeled similarity scores for these word pairs.",
        "What makes SCWS different from WS353 is that the words in SCWS are contained in sentences, i.e., there are 2003 pairs of sentences containing these words, while words in WS353 are not associated with sentences.",
        "Therefore, the human labeled scores are based on the meanings of the words in the context.",
        "Given the presence of the context, the word similarity scores, especially those scores depending on polysemous words, are much more convincing for evaluating different models?",

        "Then, we propose a method to compute the similarity score for a pair of words {w 1 ,w 2 } in the context based on our model.",
