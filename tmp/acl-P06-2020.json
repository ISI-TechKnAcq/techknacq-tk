        "This mimics the behavior of humans for single document summarization; (Kupiec, Pendersen, and Chen 1995) reported that 79% of the sentences in a human-generated abstract were a “direct match” to a sentence in a document.",
        "In contrast, for multi-document summarization, (Copeck and Szpakowicz 2004) report that no more than 55% of the vocabulary contained in human-generated abstracts can be found in the given documents.",
        "Furthermore, multiple human summaries on the same collection of documents often have little agreement.",

        "(Teufel and van Halteren 2004) used a “factoid” agreement analysis of human summaries for a single document and concluded that a resulting consensus summary is stable only if 30–40 summaries are collected.",
        "In light of the strong evidence that nearly half of the terms in human-generated multi-document abstracts are not from the original documents, and that agreement of vocabulary among human abstracts is only about 40%, we pose two coupled questions about the quality of summaries that can be attained by document extraction:",
        "1.",
        "Given the sets of unigrams used by four human summarizers, can we produce an extract summary that is statistically indistinguishable from the human abstracts when measured by current automatic evaluation methods such as ROUGE?",
        "2.",
        "If such unigram information can produce good summaries, can we replace this information by a statistical model and still produce good summaries?",
        "We will show that the answer to the first question is, indeed, yes and, in fact, the unigram set information gives rise to extract summaries that usually score better than the 4 human abstractors!",
        "Secondly, we give a method to statistically approximate the set of unigrams and find it produces extracts of the DUC 05 data which outperform all known evaluated machine entries.",
        "We conclude with experiments on the extent that redundancy removal improves extracts, as well as a method of moving beyond simple extracting by employing shallow parsing techniques to shorten the sentences prior to selection."
