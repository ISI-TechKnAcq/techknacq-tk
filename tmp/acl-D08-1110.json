        "In the linguistic, sociolinguistic, psychology, and psycholinguistic literature, bilingualism and the inherent phenomena it exhibits have been studied for nearly a century (Espinosa, 1917; Ervin and Osgood, 1954; Gumperz, 1964; Gumperz and Hernandez-Chavez, 1971; Gumperz, 1971; Sankoff, 1968; Lipski, 1978).",
        "Despite the numerous previous studies of linguistic characteristics of bilingual-ism, there is no clear consensus on the terminology related to language alternation patterns in bilingual speakers.",
        "The alternation of languages within a sentence is known as code-mixing, but it has also been referred as intrasentential code-switching, and intrasentential alternation (Poplack, 1980; Grosjean, 1982; Ardila, 2005).",
        "Alternation across sentence boundaries is known as intersentential code-switching, or just code-switching.",
        "In the rest of this paper we will refer to the mixing of languages as code-switching.",
        "When necessary, we will differentiate the type of code-switching by referring to alternations within sentences as intrasentential code-switching and alternations across sentence boundaries as intersentential code-switching.",
        "Linguistic phenomena in bilingual speakers have been analyzed on different language pairs, including English-French, English-Dutch, Finish-English, Arabic-French, and Spanish-English, to name a few.",
        "There is a general agreement that code-switched patterns are not generated randomly; according to these studies, they follow specific grammatical rules.",
        "Furthermore, some studies suggest that, if these rules are violated, the resulting discourse will sound unnatural (Toribio, 2001b; Toribio, 2001a).",
        "The following shows the rules governing code-switching discourse described in several studies (Poplack, 1980; Poplack, 1981; Sankoff, 1981; Sankoff, 1998a).",
        "• Switches can take place only between full word boundaries.",
        "This is also known as the free morpheme constraint.",
        "• Monolingual constructs within the sentence",
        "will follow the grammatical rules of the monolingual fragment.",
        "• Permissible switch points are those that do not violate the order of adjacent constituents on both sides of the switch point of either of the languages.",
        "This is called the equivalence constraint.",
        "Although these rules are somewhat controversial, and most of the studies on this area have been conducted on small samples, we cannot ignore the fact that patterns bearing the above rules have emerged in different bilingual communities with different backgrounds."

        "What Rosner and Far-rigua have found to work best for language identification in this noisy domain is a combination of a bigram Hidden Markov Model, trained on language transitions, and a trigram character Markov Model for handling unknown words.",

        "To evaluate their language model, they asked a human subject to judge sentences generated by a PCFG induced from training data and the language model.",
        "However, they only used one human judge.",
        "Regarding the automated POS tagging and parsing of code-mixed utterances there is little prior work.",

        "Sankoff proposed a production model of bilingual discourse that accounts for the equivalence constraint and the unpredictability of code-switching (Sankoff, 1998a; Sankoff, 1998b).",
        "His real-time production model draws on the alternation of fragments from two virtual monolingual sentences.",
        "It also accounts for other types of code-switching such as repetition-translation and inser-tional code-switching.",
        "But no statistical assessment has been conducted on real corpora.",
        "Our goal is to develop a POS tagger for code-switched utterances, which is the first step of the syntactic analysis of any language.",
        "Among the challenges we face is the lack of a representative sample of code-mixed discourse.",
        "Most POS taggers are built using large collections, usually at least a million words, such as the Brown corpus (Kucera and Francis, 1967), the Wall Street Journal corpus (Paul and Baker, 1992), or the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992).",
        "Currently, there is no annotation of code-switched text of comparable size.",
        "But in contrast to the lack of linguistic resources available for Spanish-English code-mixed discourse, English and Spanish have sufficient resources, especially English.",
        "Thus, rather than starting from scratch, we will draw on existing taggers for both languages, which will reduce the amount of code-switched data needed.",
        "Some examples of POS taggers that perform reasonably well on monolingual text of each language can be found in (Brants, 2000; Brill, 1992; Carreras and Padro, 2002; Charniak, 1993; Ratna-parkhi, 1996; Schmid, 1994).",
        "However, these tools are designed to work on monolingual text, therefore if applied as they are to code-switched text, their accuracy will decrease by a large margin.",

        "We analyzed the different results gathered through the experiments and we present here the most relevant insights.",
        "The first discovery, is that a lot of the errors made by the oracle, and the other methods as well, are due to the difficulties inherent in dealing with spontaneous speech where fillers, interruption points, hesitations, and the like abound.",
        "About as much as 20% of the errors made by the oracle are due to these features.",
        "Another roughly 20% is due to unknown tokens in the transcription, such as mumbling, slang words such as \"gonna\" and \"wanna\", or other sounds unintelligible for the human transcriber.",
        "For the rest of the analysis we decided to ignore these types of mistakes for all methods and focus only on the remaining mistakes.",
        "In the case of the oracle we are left with 445 erroneously POS tagged words.",
        "From those, about 50%, or 233 to be exact, are errors in sentences with code-switches.",
        "We consider this to be a strong indication of the complexity that intrasentential switches add to the task of POS tagging.",
        "For the taggers, these sentences are incomplete, or ill-formed, since they have fragments with foreign words and thus, they fail to identify them.",
        "The rest of the oracle mistakes can not be attributable to a single cause.",
        "Some are fragmented sentences, and some are due to errors inherent of the tagger, but nothing is particulary salient about them.",
        "The language identification methods share, of course, the same mistakes made by the oracle, plus 342 more, for a total of 787 (in the case of the dictionary-based language identification).",
        "The challenge of POS tagging code-switched text is more evident for this method.",
        "Out of the mistakes made by the language identification method, 540 lie in sentences with code-switching, that is, nearly 70% of the mistakes.",

        "Analyzing the predictions made by SVM we verified that out of the 445 errors made by the oracle, SVM correctly tagged 223, the majority of which are words in sentences with code-switching (142 words).",
        "When compared against the errors from the method based on language identification, SVM correctly tagged 481 words out of the 787, 374 of which are words in sentences with code-switches.",
        "In summary, the ML approach is more robust to code-switched sentences.",
        "Note that we did find some errors made by the ML approach that are not shared by the oracle or the language identification method, a total of 105.",
        "Some of these mistakes are due to inconsistencies on the human-annotated tags.",
        "For instance, in most cases slang words such as \"gonna\" and \"wanna\" are labeled as unknown words, but we found that these words were labeled as verbs in a few cases.",

        "The average accuracy of this CRF was 81%, which is lower than the language identification heuristic.",
        "We believe that this low accuracy is due to the lack of a representative sample of annotated Spanglish.",

        "Code-switching is a fresh and exciting research area that has received little attention in the language processing community.",
        "Research on this topic has many interesting applications, including automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and computer assisted language learning.",
        "In this paper we present preliminary work towards developing a POS tagger for English-Spanish code-switched text that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first effort towards this end.",
        "We explored different heuristics for taking advantage of existing linguistic resources for English and Spanish with unimpressive results.",
        "A simple wordlevel language identification strategy outperformed all heuristics tested.",
        "But the best results, even better than the oracle, were achieved by using machine learning using the output of monolingual POS taggers as input features.",
        "In the error analysis we showed that most of the mistakes made by the language identification method, and the oracle itself, occur in sentences with intrasentential code-switching, showing the difficulty of the task.",
        "In contrast, our machine learning approach was less sensitive to the complexity of this alternation pattern.",
        "There is still a lot of work to do in this area.",
        "Our ongoing efforts include gathering a larger corpus, with different speakers and conversational styles, as well as written forms of code-switching from blogs and Internet forums.",
        "In addition, we are exploring the use of context information.",
        "The features we are currently using to represent each word do not take into account the context surrounding the word.",
        "We want to test if by using contextual features we can further improve our results.",
        "In this study we focused on code-switching, but borrowing is another complex language alternation pattern that we want the POS tagger to handle.",
        "We are working on developing a special method for identification and morphological analysis of borrowings.",
        "This method will help increase the accuracy of the POS tagger.",
        "Spanish-English is not the only popular combination of languages.",
        "An interesting line of future work would be to explore if the method presented here can be adapted to different language combinations.",
        "Moreover, multilingual communities will code-switch among more than two codes and this poses fascinating research challenges as well."
