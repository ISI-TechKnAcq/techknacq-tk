        "Shallow-n grammars (de Gispert et al., 2010) were introduced to reduce over-generation in the Hiero translation model (Chiang, 2005) resulting in much faster decoding and restricting reordering to a desired level for specific language pairs.",
        "However, Shallow-n grammars require parameters which cannot be directly optimized using minimum error-rate tuning by the decoder.",
        "This paper introduces some novel improvements to the translation model for Shallow-n grammars.",
        "We introduce two rules: a BITG-style reordering glue rule and a simpler monotonic concatenation rule.",

        "Hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) extends the highly lexicalized models from phrase-based translation systems in order to model lexicalized reordering and discon-tiguous phrases.",
        "However, a major drawback in this approach, when compared to phrase-based systems, is the total number of rules that are learnt are several orders of magnitude larger than standard phrase tables, which leads to over-generation and search errors and contribute to much longer decoding times.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to address these issues: from filtering the extracted synchronous grammar (Zollmann et al., 2008; He et al., 2009; Iglesias et al., 2009) to alternative Bayesian approaches for learning minimal grammars (Blunsom et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009; Sankaran et al., 2011).",
        "The idea of Shallow-n grammars (de Gispert et al., 2010) takes an orthogonal direction for controlling the over-generation and search space in Hiero decoder by restricting the degree of nesting allowed for Hierarchical rules.",
        "We propose an novel statistical model for Shallow-n grammars which does not require additional non-terminals for monotonic reordering and also eliminates hand-tuned parameters and instead introduces an automatically tunable alternative.",
        "We introduce a BITG-style (Saers et al., 2009) reordering glue rule (?",
        "3) and a monotonic X-glue rule (?",
        "4).",
        "Our experiments show the resulting Shallow-n decoding is comparable in translation quality to full Hiero-style decoding while at the same time being considerably faster.",
        "All the experiments in this paper were done using Kriya (Sankaran et al., 2012) hierarchical phrase-based system which also supports decoding with Shallow-n grammars.",
        "We extended Kriya to additionally support reordering glue rules as well."

        "It also uses additional parameters such as monotonicity level (K1 and K2), maximum and minimum rule spans allowed for the non-terminals (?3.1 and 3.2 in de Gispert et al. (2010)).",

        "The maximum and minimum rule spans further control the usage of hierarchical rule in a derivation by stipulating the underlying span to be within a range of values.",
        "Intuitively, this avoids hierarchical rules being used for a source phrase that is either too short or too long.",
        "While these parameters offer flexibility for adapting the translation system to specific language pairs, they have to be manually tuned which is tedious and error-prone.",
        "We propose an elegant and automatically tunable alternative for the Shallow-n grammars setting.",
        "Specifically, we introduce a BITG-style reordering glue rule (?",
        "3) and a monotonic X-glue rule (?",
        "4).",
        "Our experiments show the resulting Shallow-n decoding to perform to the same level as full-Hiero decoding at the same time being faster.",
        "In addition, our implementation of Shallow-n grammar differs from (de Gispert et al., 2010) in at least two other aspects.",
        "First, their formulation constrains the X in the glue rules to be at the top-level and specifically they define them to be: S ?",
        "<SXN , SXN> and S ?",
        "<XN , XN>, where XN is the non-terminal corresponding to the topmost level.",
        "Interestingly, this resulted in poor BLEU scores and we found the more generic glue rules (as in (1) and (2)) to perform significantly better, as we show later.",
        "Secondly, they also employ pattern-based filtering (Iglesias et al., 2009) in order to reducing redundancies in the Hiero grammar by filtering it based on certain rule patterns.",
        "However in our limited experiments, we observed the filtered grammar to perform worse than the full grammar, as also noted by (Zollmann et al., 2008).",
        "Hence, we do not employ any grammar filtering in our experiments."

        "In contrast, Hiero-style systems typically use CKY chart-parsing decoders which can freely combine target hypotheses generated in intermediate cells with hierarchical rules in the higher cells.",
        "Thus the generation of the target hypotheses are fragmented and out of order compared to the left to right order preferred by n-gram language models.",
        "This leads to challenges in the estimation of language model scores for partial target hypothesis, which is being addressed in different ways in the existing Hiero-style systems.",
        "Some systems add a sentence initial marker (<s>) to the beginning of each path and some other systems have this implicitly in the derivation through the translation models.",
        "Thus the language model scores for the hypothesis in the intermediate cell are approximated, with the true language model score (taking into account sentence boundaries) being computed in the last cell that spans the entire source sentence.",
        "We introduce a novel improvement in computing the language model scores: for each of the target hypothesis fragment, our approach finds the best position for the fragment in the final sentence and uses the corresponding score.",

        "For example, a partial candidate covering a non-final source span might translate to the final position in the target sentence.",
        "If we just compute the LM score for the target fragment as is done normally, this might get pruned early on before being reordered by the new glue rule.",

        "Note that, three of the four human references prefer this long distance reordering, while the fourth one avoids the movement by using a complex construction with relative clause and a sentence initial prepositional phrase.",
        "Such long distance reordering is very difficult in conventional Hiero decoding and more so with the Shallow-n grammars.",
        "While the R-glue rule permit such long distance movements, it also requires a long phrase generated by a series of rules to be moved as a block.",
