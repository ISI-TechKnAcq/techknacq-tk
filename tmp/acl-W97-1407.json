        "From this point of view, reference relations between a description of script and an actor/actress who actually plays in the drama scenes that correspond to the script are the most useful pieces of information for scene retrieval, and consequently they become our research targets.",
        "If we successfully identify this kind of reference, it is a great help for multimedia information retrieval, especially scene retrieval from data base of drama videos.",
        "However the whole script of drama is so complicated that we cannot deal with by today's natural language processing technologies.",

        "Although the rules and the treatment of exceptional cases are very important, generally if a sentence of scene direction describes that the referent of subject does an action or is in a certain state, the referent surely exists in the scene.",
        "Another group of expressions that are frequently used and are important to build an existence/action map are a stative verb \"iru('exist')\" and its negation \"inai(not exist').\"",
        "They explicitly show the existence or non-existence of a referent of subject in the scene.",

        "If \"inai\" is used as a predicate, the referent of the subject is not in the scene.",

        "and 2 correctly extract subjects and predicates.",
        "We use not a parser which is based on phrase structure rules but a simple pattern matching based on rule 1 through 8.",
        "Nevertheless these results indicate that our rules for extracting subjects and predicates work quite well.",
        "The main reason of failing to extract a subject is the failure of inferring the referent of zero subject.",
        "The almost all reasons of failing predicate extraction is the failure of morphological analyzer.",
        "The next results we show are the accuracy of our existence/action map.",
        "The key factor for scene retrieval is whether a specific player appears on the scene or not.",
        "Therefore we focus on how accurately existences and absences, namely EXIs and ABSs, are inferred.",
        "We estimate this with recall and precision rates defined as follows.",
        "where #CI, #I, and #I means \"number of correctly inferred cases in the map by our rules\", \"number of cases to be correctly inferred\" , and \"number of all cases inferred by our rules\" , respectively.",
