        "This involves a mapping from a semantic encoding of time to a set of tense/aspect permutations.",
        "The encoding tool realizes each permutation to give a readable, precise description of the narrative so that users can check whether they have correctly encoded actions and statives in the formal representation.",
        "Our method selects tenses and aspects for individual event intervals as well as subintervals (with multiple reference points), quoted and unquoted speech (which reassign the temporal focus), and modal events such as conditionals."

        "Generation systems that communicate knowledge about time must select tense and aspect carefully in their surface realizations.",
        "An incorrect assignment can give the erroneous impression that a continuous action has ended, or that a previous state is the current reality.",
        "In this paper, we consider English tense and aspect in the generation of narrative discourse, where statives and actions occur over connected intervals.",
        "We describe two contributions: first, a general application of theories of tense, aspect and interval logic to a generation context in which we map temporal relationships to specific tense/aspect selections.",
        "Second, we describe an implementation of this approach in an interactive environment with a basic sentence planner and realizer.",
        "The first result does not depend on the second.",
        "The purpose of the system is to allow users who are naive to linguistics and knowledge representation to create semantic encodings of short stories.",
        "To do this, they construct propositions (predicate-argument structures) through a graphical, menu-based interface, and assign them to intervals on a timeline.",
        "Figure 1 shows a session in which the user is encoding a fable of Aesop.",
        "The top-right panel shows the original fable, and the left-hand panel shows a graphical timeline with buttons for constructing new propositions at certain intervals.",
        "The left-hand and bottom-right panels contain automatically generated text of the encoded story, as the system understands it, from different points of view.",
        "Users rely on these realizations to check that they have assigned the formal connections correctly.",
        "The tenses and aspects of these sentences are a key component of this feedback.",
        "We describe the general purpose of the system, its data model, and the encoding methodology in a separate paper (Elson and McKeown, 2010).",
        "The paper is organized as follows: After discussing related work in Section 2, we describe our method for selecting tense and aspect for single events in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 follows with more complex cases involving multiple events and shifts in temporal focus.",
        "We then discuss the results."

        "There has been intense interest in the interpretation of tense and aspect into a formal understanding of the ordering and duration of events.",
        "This work has been in both linguistics (Dowty, 1979; Nerbonne, 1986; Vlach, 1993) and natural language understanding.",
        "Early systems investigated rule-based approaches to parsing the durations and orderings of events from the tenses and aspects of their verbs (Hinrichs, 1987; Webber, 1987; Song and Cohen, 1988; Passonneau, 1988).",
        "Allen (1984) and Steedman (1995) focus on distinguishing between achievements (when an event culminates in a result, such as John builds a house) and processes (such as walking).",
        "More recent work has centered on markup languages for complex temporal information (Mani, 2004) and corpus-based (statistical) models for predicting temporal relationships on unseen text (Mani et al., 2006; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006).",
        "Our annotation interface requires a fast realizer that can be easily integrated into an interactive, online encoding tool.",
        "We found that developing a custom realizer as a module to our Java-based system was preferable to integrating a large, general purpose system such as KPML/Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991) or FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996).",
        "These realizers, along with RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), accept tense as a parameter, but do not calculate it from a semantic representation of overlapping time intervals such as ours (though the Nigel grammar can calculate tense from speech, event, and reference time orderings, discussed below).",
        "The statistically trained rule-based approach.",
        "Dorr and Gaasterland (1995) and Grote (1998) focus on generating temporal connectives, such as before, based on the relative times and durations of two events; Gagnon and Lapalme (1996) focus on temporal adverbials (e.g., when to insert a known time of day for an event).",
        "By comparison, we extend our approach to cover direct/indirect speech and the subjunctive/conditional forms, which they do not report implementing.",
        "While our work focuses on English, Yang and Bateman (2009) describe a recent system for generating Chinese aspect expressions based on a time interval representation, using KPML as their surface realizer.",
        "Several other projects run tangential to our interactive narrative encoding project.",
        "Callaway and Lester's STORYBOOK (2002) aims to improve fluency and discourse cohesion in realizing formally encoded narratives; Ligozat and Zock (1992) allow users to interactively construct sentences in various temporal scenarios through a graphical interface."

        "The propositions that we aim to realize take the form of a predicate, one or more arguments, zero or more attached modifiers (either a negation operator or an adverbial, which is itself a proposition), and an assignment in time.",
        "Each argument is associated with a semantic role (such as Agent or Ex-periencer), and may include nouns (such as characters) or other propositions.",
        "In our implemented system, the set of predicates available to the annotator is adapted from the VerbNet (Kingsbury linguistic databanks.",
        "These provide both durative actions and statives (Dowty, 1979); we will refer to both as events as they occur over intervals.",
        "For example, here are an action and a stative:",
        "The latter two arguments in (1) refer to time states in a totally ordered sequence; Mary starts walking to the store at state 2 and finishes walking at state 6.",
        "(2) begins at state 1, but is unbounded (Julia never ceases being hungry).",
        "While this paper does not address the use of reference times (such as equating a state to 6:00 or yesterday), this is an area of ongoing work.",
        "(1) and (2), depending on the situation, can be realized in several aspects and tenses.",
        "We adapt and extend Reichenbach's (1947) famous system of symbols for distinguishing between simple and progressive aspect.",
        "Reichenbach identifies three points that define the temporal position of the event: the event time E, the speech time S, and a reference time R which may or may not be indicated by a temporal adverbial.",
        "The total ordering between these times dictates the appropriate aspect.",
        "For example, the simple past John laughed has the relation E < S. R = E because there is no separate reference time involved.",
        "The past perfect John had laughed [by the end of the play] has the relation E < R < S, in that it describe \"the past of the past\", with the nearer \"past\" being R (the end of the play).",
        "R can be seen as the temporal focus of the sentence.",
        "As Reichenbach does not address events with intervals, we redefine E as the transition (E1..E2) attached to the proposition (for example, (2,6) for Mary's walk).",
        "This definition deliberately assumes that no event ever occurs over a single \"instant\" of time.",
        "The perception of an instantaneous event, when it is needed, is instead created by dilating R into an interval large enough to contain the entire event, as in Dowty (1979).",
        "We also distinguish between two generation modes: realizing the story as a complete discourse (narration mode) and describing the content of a single state or interval (snapshot mode).",
        "Our system supports both modes differently.",
        "In discourse mode, we realize the story as if all events occur before the speech time S, which is the style of most literary fiction.",
        "(We shall see that this does not preclude the use of the future tense.)",
        "In snapshot mode, speech time is concurrent with reference time so that the same events are realized as though they are happening \"now.\"",
        "The system uses this mode to allow annotators to inspect and edit what occurs at any point in the story.",
        "In Figure 1, for instance, the lion's watching of the bull is realized as both a present, continuing event in snapshot mode (the lion continues to watch the bull) and narrated as a past, continuing event (the lion was watching the bull).",
        "In both cases, we aim to precisely translate the propositions and their temporal relationships into text, even if the results are not elegant rhetoric, so that annotators can see how they have formally encoded the story.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we describe our method for assigning tenses and aspects to propositions such as these.",
        "In both snapshot and narration modes, we often need to render the events that occur at some reference state R. We would like to know, for instance, what is happening now, or what happened at 6:00 yesterday evening.",
        "The tense and aspect depend on the perspective of the reference state on the event, which can be bounded or unbounded.",
        "The two-step process for this scenario is to determine the correct perspective, then pick the tense and aspect class that best communicates it.",
        "We define the set of possible perspectives to follow Allen (1983), who describes seven relationships between two intervals: before/after, meets/met by, overlaps/overlapped by, starts/started by, during/contains, finishes/finished by, and equals.",
        "Not all of these map to a relationship between a single reference point and an event interval.",
        "Table 1 maps each possible interaction between E and R to a perspective, for both bounded and unbounded events, including the defining relationships for each interaction.",
        "A diamond for Ei indicates at or before, i.e., the event is either anteriorly unbounded (E\\ = – 00) or beginning at a state prior to R and E2.",
        "Similarly, a diamond for E2 indicates at or after.",
        "Once the perspective is determined, covering Reichenbach's E and R, speech time S is determined by the generation mode.",

        "If this speech act is described by a character later in the story, then we need to carefully separate what is known to Mary at the time of her speech from what is later known at R by the teller of the episode.",
        "Mary sees her purchase of eggs as a possible future, even though it may have already happened by the point of retelling, and Mary does not know that Julia's hunger is to end before long.",
        "Following Hornstein's treatment of these scenarios (Hornstein, 1990), we attach R', the reference time for Mary's statement (in an alternate timeline), to Espeech, the event of her speaking (in the main timeline).",
        "The act of buying eggs is a hypothetical event E'b that falls after R' on the alternate (modal) timeline.",

        "Real events, such as Julia's hunger, can be invoked in the alternate timeline (as drawn with a vertical line from Ehunger to an Ehunger without an E2 known to Mary) but they must preserve their order from the main timeline.",
        "^speech T",
        "^hunger '-hunger^",
        "The tense assignment for the event intervals in the alternate timeline then proceeds as normal, with R' substituting for R. The hypothetical \"buy\" event is seen in Before perspective, but past tense (Future Speech), giving the \"posterior\" (future-of-a-past) tense.",
        "Julia's hunger is seen as During as per Table 1.",
        "Further, we assert that connectives such as Because do not alter R (or in this situation,",

        "with a causality edge.",
        "(Annotators can indicate connectives between events for causality, motivation and other features of narrative cohesion.)",
        "The result is: Mary had said that she was going to buy eggs because Julia was hungry.",
        "The subordinate clause following that sees E'buyin the future, and Ehunger as ongoing rather than in the past.",
        "It is appropriately ambiguous in both the symbolic and rendered forms whether E'buy occurs at all, and if so, whether it occurs before, during or after R. A discourse planner would have the responsibility of pointing out Mary's mistaken assumption about the duration of Julia's hunger.",
        "We assign tense and aspect for quoted speech differently than for unquoted speech.",
        "Instead of holding S fixed, S' is assigned to R' at the attachment point of the alternate timeline (the \"present time\" for the speech act).",
        "If future hypothetical events are present, they invoke the Past Speech constructions in Table 2 that have not been used by either narration or snapshot mode.",
        "The content of the quoted speech then operates totally independently of the speech action, since both R' and S'are detached: Mary said/says/was saying, \"I am going to buy eggs because Julia is hungry.\"",
        "The focus of the sentence can be subsequently reassigned to deeper nested timelines as necessary (attaching E' to R'', and so on).",
        "Although the above example uses subordinate clauses, we can use this nesting technique to construct composite tenses such as those enumerated by Halliday (1976).",
        "To this end, we conjugate the Modal Infinitive construction in Table 2 for each alternate timeline.",
        "For instance, Halliday's complex form \"present in past in future in past in future\" (as in",
        "will have been going to have been taking) can be generated with four timelines in a chain that invoke, in order and with Past Speech, the After, Before, After and During perspectives.",
        "There are four Rs, all but the main one attached to a previous E.",
        "We finally consider tense and aspect in the case of subjunctive and conditional statements (if-thens), which can appear in alternate timelines.",
        "The relationship between an ifclause and a then clause is not the same as the relationship between two clauses joined by because or when.",
        "The then clause-or set of clauses-is predicated on the truth of the ifclause.",
        "As linguists have noted (Hornstein, 1990, p.74), the if clause serves as an adverbial modifier, which has the effect of moving forward the reference point to the last of the ifevent intervals (provided that the ifrefers to a hypothetical future).",
        "Consider the sentence: If John were to fly to Tokyo, he would have booked a hotel.",
        "A correct model would place E'book before Ef 1y on an alternate timeline, with Ef 1y as the if.",
        "Since were to fly is a hypothetical future, R' < Ef 1y.",
        "During regeneration, we set R' to Ef 1y after rendering If John were to fly to Tokyo, because we begin to assume that this event transpired.",
        "If R' is left unchanged, it may be erroneously left before E'book : Then he would be going to book a hotel.",
        "Our encoding interface allows users to mark one or more events in an alternate timeline as ifevents.",
        "If at least one event is marked, all ifevents are rendered in the subjunctive mood, and the remainder are rendered in the conditional.",
        "For the ifclauses that follow R', S' and R' itself are reassigned to the interval for each clause in turn.",
        "R' and S' then remain at the latest if interval (if it is after the original R') for purposes of rendering the then clauses.",
        "In our surface realizer, auxiliary words were and would are combined with the Modal Infinitive constructions in Table 2 for events during or following the original attachment point.",
        "As an example, consider an alternate timeline with two statives whose start and end points are the same: Julia is hungry and Julia is unhappy.",
        "The former is marked if.",
        "Semantically, we are saying that hungry(Julia) -^unhappy(Julia).",
        "If R' were within these intervals, the rendering would be: IfJulia is hungry, then she is unhappy (Contains/Present Speech for both clauses).",
        "If R' were prior to these intervals, the rendering would be: If Julia were to be hungry, then she would be unhappy.",
        "This reassigns R' to Ehungry, using were as a futurative and would to indicate a conditional.",
        "Because R' and S' are set to Ehungry, the perspective on both clauses remains Contains/Present Speech.",
        "Finally, if both intervals are before R', describing Julia's previous emotional states, we avoid shifting R' and S'backward: IfJulia had been hungry, then she had been unhappy (After perspective, Future Speech for both statives).",
        "The algorithm is the same for event intervals.",
        "Take (1) and a prior event where Mary runs out of",

        "We begin by realizing Mary's walk as an ifclause: If Mary were to walk to the store.",
        "We reassign R'to Ewaik, (2,6), which diverts the perception of (3) from Begins to After: She would have run out ofeggs.",
        "Conversely, suppose the conditional relationship were reversed, with (3) as the only if action.",
        "If the attachment point is 3', we realize (3) first in the After perspective, as R' does not shift backward: IfMary had run out ofeggs.",
        "The remainder is rendered from the During perspective: She would be walking to the store.",
        "Note that in casual conversation, we might expect a speaker at R = 3 to use the past simple: If Mary ran out ofeggs, she would be walking to the store.",
        "In this case, the speaker is attaching the alternate timeline at a reference interval that subsumes (3), invoking the Contains perspective by casting a net around the past.",
        "We ask our annotators to select the best attachment point manually; automatically making this choice is beyond the scope of this paper."

        "These scores are not specific to the generation component, but they suggest that annotators could derive satisfactory tenses from their semantic structures.",
