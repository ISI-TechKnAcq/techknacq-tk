        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) applies machine learning techniques to a bilingual corpus to produce a translation system entirely automatically.",
        "Such a scheme has many potential advantages over earlier systems which relied on carefully crafted rules.",
        "The most obvious is that it at dramatically reduces cost in human labor and it is able to reach many critical translation rules that are easily overlooked by human being.",
        "SMT systems generally assemble translations by selecting phrases from a large candidate set.",
        "unsupervised learning often introduces a considerable amount of noise into this set as a result of which the selection process becomes more longer and less effective.",
        "This paper provides one approach to these problems.",
        "Various filtering techniques, such as (Johnson et al., 2007) and (Chen et al., 2008), have been applied to eliminate a large portion of the translation rules that were judged unlikely to be of value for the current translation.",
        "However, these approaches were only able to improve the translation quality slightly.",
        "In this paper, we describe a triangulation approach (Kay, 1997) that incorporates multilingual data to improve system efficiency and translation quality at the same time.",
        "Most of the previous triangulation approaches (Kumar et al., 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Filali and Bilmes, 2005; Simard, 1999; Och and Ney, 2001) add information obtained from a third language.",
        "In other words, they work with the union of the data from the different languages.",
        "In contrast, we work with the intersection of information acquired through a third language.",
        "The hope is that the intersection will be more precise and more compact than the union, so that a better result will be obtained more efficiently."

        "As we have said models built in this way tend to contain a contains a considerable amount of noise.",
        "The phrase-table entries are far less reliable than the lexicons and grammar rules handcrafted for rule-based systems.",
        "The main source of noise in the phrase table is errors from the word alignment process.",
        "For example, many function words occur so frequently that they are incorrectly mapped to translations of many function words in the other language to which they are, in fact, unrelated.",
        "On the other hand, many words remain unaligned on account of their very low frequency.",
        "Another source noise comes from the phrase extraction algorithm itself.",
        "The unaligned words are usually attached to aligned sequences In order to achieve longer phrase pairs.",
        "The final selection of entries from the phrase table is based not only on the values assigned to them there, but also to values coming from the language and reordering models, so that entries that receive an initially high value may end up not being preferred.",

        "The phrase pairs \"ihre kinder nicht – their children are not\" and \"ihre kinder nicht – their children\" are both likely also to appear in the phrase table and the former has greater estimated probability.",

        "(2) They love their children.",

        "We highlighted one problem of the state-of-the-art SMT systems that was generally neglected: the noise in the translation models.",
        "Accordingly, we proposed triangulated filtering methods to deal with this problem.",
        "We used data in a third language as evidence to locate the less probable items in the translation models so as to obtain the intersection of information extracted from multilingual data.",
        "Only the occurrences of complete phrases were taken into account.",
        "The probability distributions of the phrases have not been considered so far.",
        "Although the approach was fairly naive, our experiments showed it to be effective.",
        "The approaches were applied to SMT systems built with the Moses toolkit.",
        "The translation quality was improved at least 1 Bleu for all 15 cases (filtering 3 different models with 5 bridge languages).",
        "The improvement can be as much as 2.25 Bleu.",
        "It is also clear that the best translations were not linked to the largest translation models.",
        "We also sketched a simple extension to the triangulated filtering approach to further reduce the model size, which allows us to generate reasonable results with only 1.4% of the entries from the original table.",
        "The results varied for different bridge languages as well as different models.",
        "For translation from",
        "Spanish to English, Finnish, the most distinctive bridge language, appeared to be a more effective intermediate language which could remove more phrase pair entries while still improving the translation quality.",
        "Portuguese, the most close to the source language, always leads to a filtered model that produces the best translations.",
        "The selection of bridge languages has more obvious impact on the performance of our approach when the size of the model to filter was larger.",
        "The work gave one instance of the general approach described in Section 3.",
        "There are several potential directions for continuing this work.",
        "The most straightforward one is to use our approaches with more different languages, such as Chinese and Arabic, and incompatible corpora, for example, different segments of Europarl.",
        "The main focus of such experiments should be verifying the conclusions we had in this paper."
