        "Phrase has become the standard basic translation unit in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) since it naturally captures context dependency and models internal word reordering.",
        "In a phrase-based SMT system, the phrase translation table is the defining component which specifies alternative translations and their probabilities for a given source phrase.",
        "In learning such a table from parallel corpus, two related issues need to be addressed (either separately or jointly): which pairs are considered valid translations and how to assign weights, such as probabilities, to them.",
        "The first problem is referred to as phrase pair extraction, which identifies phrase pairs that are supposed to be translations of each other.",
        "Methods have been proposed, based on syntax, that take advantage of linguistic constraints and alignment of grammatical structure, such as in Yamada and Knight (2001) and Wu (1995).",
        "The most widely used approach derives phrase pairs from word alignment matrix (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Other methods do not depend on word alignments only, such as directly modeling phrase alignment in a joint generative way (Marcu and Wong, 2002) , pursuing information extraction perspective (Venugopal et al., 2003), or augmenting with modelbased phrase pair posterior (Deng and Byrne, 2005).",
        "Using relative frequency as translation probability is a common practice to measure goodness of a phrase pair.",
        "Since most phrases appear only a few times in training data, a phrase pair translation is also evaluated by lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) or term weighting (Zhao et al., 2004) as additional features to avoid overestimation.",
        "The translation probability can also be discriminatively trained such as in Tillmann and Zhang (2006).",
        "The focus of this paper is the phrase pair extraction problem.",
        "As in information retrieval, precision and recall issues need to be addressed with a right balance for building a phrase translation table.",
        "High precision requires that identified translation candidates are accurate, while high recall wants as much valid phrase pairs as possible to be extracted, which is important and necessary for online translation that requires coverage.",
        "In the word-alignment derived phrase extraction approach, precision can be improved by filtering out most of the entries by using a statistical significance test (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "On the other hand, there are valid translation pairs in the training corpus that are not learned due to word alignment errors as shown in Deng and Byrne (2005).",
        "We would like to improve phrase translation accuracy and at the same time extract as many as possible valid phrase pairs that are missed due to incorrect word alignments.",
        "One approach is to leverage underlying word alignment quality such as in Ayan and Dorr (2006).",
        "In this work, we present a generic discriminative phrase pair extraction framework that can integrate multiple features aiming to identify correct phrase translation candidates.",
        "A significant deviation from most other approaches is that the framework is parameterized and can be optimized jointly with the decoder to maximize translation performance on a development set.",
        "Within the general framework, the main work is on investigating useful metrics.",
        "We employ features based on word alignment models and alignment matrix.",
        "We also propose information metrics that are derived from both bilingual and monolingual perspectives.",
        "All these features are data-driven and independent of languages.",

        "More details will be given in Section 3.",
        "Step 2 (line 2) consists of phrase pair evaluation, ranking and filtering.",
        "Usually all n-grams up to a predefined length limit are considered as candidate phrases.",
        "This is also the place where linguistic constraints can be applied, say to avoid non-compositional phrases (Lin, 1999).",
        "Each normalized feature score derived from word alignment models or language models will be log-linearly combined to generate the final score.",
        "Phrase pair filtering is simply thresholding on the final score by comparing to the maximum within the sentence pair.",
        "Note that under the log-linear model, applying threshold for filtering is equivalent to comparing the \"likelihood\" ratio.",
        "Step 3 (line 14) pools all candidate phrase pairs that pass the threshold testing and estimates the final phrase translation table by maximum likelihood criterion.",
        "For each candidate phrase pair which is above the threshold, we assign HMM-based phrase pair posterior as its soft count when dumping them into the global phrase pair pool.",
        "Other possibilities for the weighting include assigning constant one or the exponential of the final score etc.",
        "One of the advantages of the proposed phrase training algorithm is that it is a parameterized procedure that can be optimized jointly with the translation engine to minimize the final translation errors measured by automatic metrics such as BLEU (Pa-pineni et al., 2002).",
        "In the final step 4 (line 15), parameters {Ak, t } are discriminatively trained on a development set using the downhill simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965).",
        "This phrase training procedure is general in the sense that it is configurable and trainable with different feature functions and their parameters.",
        "The commonly used phrase extraction approach based on word alignment heuristics (referred as ViterbiEx-tract algorithm for comparison in this paper) as described in (Och, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) is a special case of the algorithm, where candidate phrase pairs are restricted to those that respect word alignment boundaries.",
        "We rely on multiple feature functions that aim to describe the quality of candidate phrase translations and the generic procedure to figure out the best way of combining these features.",

        "Now we present several feature functions that we investigated to help extracting correct phrase translations.",
        "All these features are data-driven and defined based on models, such as statistical word alignment model or language model.",
        "In a statistical generative word alignment model (Brown et al., 1993), it is assumed that (i) a random variable a specifies how each target word fj is generated by (therefore aligned to) a source word eaj; and (ii) the likelihood function f (f, a|e) specifies a generative procedure from the source sentence to the target sentence.",
        "Given a phrase pair in a sentence pair, there will be many generative paths that align the source phrase to the target phrase.",
        "The likelihood of those generative procedures can be accumulated to get the likelihood of the phrase pair (Deng and Byrne, 2005).",
        "This is implemented as the summation of the likelihood function over all valid hidden word alignments.",
        "More specifically, let A^'^) be the set of word alignment a that aligns the source phrase eJ1 to the target phrase f^ (links to NULL word are ignored for simplicity):",
        "The alignment set given a phrase pair ignores those pairs with word links across the phrase boundary.",
        "Consequently, the phrase-pair posterior distribution is defined as",
        "Switching the source and the target, we can obtain the posterior distribution in another translation direction.",
        "This distribution is applicable to all word alignment models that follow assumptions (i) and (ii).",
        "However, the complexity of the likelihood function could make it impractical to calculate the summations in Equation 1 unless an approximation is applied.",
        "Several feature functions will be defined on top of the posterior distribution.",
        "One of them is based on HMM word alignment model.",
        "We use the geometric mean of posteriors in two translation directions as a symmetric metric for phrase pair quality evaluation function under HMM alignment models.",
        "Table 1 shows the phrase pair posterior matrix of the example.",
        "Replacing the word alignment model with IBM Model-1 is another feature function that we added.",
        "IBM Model-1 is simple yet has been shown to be effective in many applications (Och et al., 2004).",
        "There is a close form solution to calculate the phrase pair posterior under Model-1.",
        "Moreover, word to word translation table under HMM is more concentrated than that under Model-1.",
        "Therefore, the posterior distribution evaluated by Model-1 is smoother and potentially it can alleviate the overestimation problem in HMM especially when training data size is small.",
        "Trying to find phrase translations for any possible n-gram is not a good idea for two reasons.",
        "First, due to data sparsity and/or alignment model's capability, there would exist n-grams that cannot be aligned well, for instance, n-grams that are part of a paraphrase translation or metaphorical expression.",
        "To give an example, the unigram 'tomorrow' in 'the day after tomorrow' whose Chinese translation is a single word '/n Extracting candidate translations for such kind of n-grams for the sake of improving coverage (recall) might hurt translation quality (precision).",
        "We will define a confidence metric to estimate how reliably the model can align an n-gram in one side to a phrase on the other side given a parallel sentence.",
        "Second, some n-grams themselves carry no linguistic meaning; their phrase translations can be misleading, for example non-compositional phrases (Lin, 1999).",
        "We will address this in section 3.3.",
        "Given a sentence pair, the basic assumption is that if the HMM word alignment model can align an English phrase well to a foreign phrase, the posterior distribution of the English phrase generating all foreign phrases on the other side is significantly biased.",
        "For instance, the posterior of one foreign phrase is far larger than that of the others.",
        "We use the entropy of the posterior distribution as the confidence metric:",
        "where H(P) = – J2x P(x) 1°S P(x) is the entropy of a distribution P(x), P$HMM(e^ – *) is the normalized probability (sum up to 1) of the posterior P$HMM (ei 1 – *) as defined in Equation 1.",
        "Low entropy signals a high confidence that the English phrase can be aligned correctly.",
        "On the other hand, high entropy implies ambiguity presented in discriminating the correct foreign phrase from the others from the viewpoint of the model.",
        "Similarly we calculate the confidence metric of aligning a foreign phrase correctly with the word alignment model in foreign to English direction.",
        "Table 1 shows the entropy of phrases.",
        "The unigram of foreign side /| is unlikely to survive with such high ambiguity.",
        "Adding the entropy in two directions defines the bilingual information metric as another feature function, which describes the reliability of aligning each phrase correctly by the model.",
        "Note that we used HMM word alignment model to find the posterior distribution.",
        "Other models such as Model-1 can be applied in the same way.",
        "This feature function quantitatively captures the goodness of phrases.",
        "During phrase pair ranking, it can help to move upward phrases that can be aligned well and push downward phrases that are difficult for the model to find correct translations.",
        "Now we turn to monolingual resources to evaluate the quality of an n-gram being a good phrase.",
        "A phrase in a sentence is specified by its boundaries.",
        "We assume that the boundaries of a good phrase should be the \"right\" place to break.",
        "More generally, we want to quantify how effective a word boundary is as a phrase boundary.",
        "One would perform say NP-chunking or parsing to avoid splitting a linguistic constituent.",
        "We apply a language model (LM) to describe the predictive uncertainty (PU) between words in two directions.",
        "Given a history wn-1, a language model specifies a conditional distribution of the future word being predicted to follow the history.",
        "We can find the entropy of such pdf: Hlm (wn-1) = H (P So given a sentence wN, the PU of the boundary between word wi and wi+1 is established by two-way entropy sum using a forward and backward language model: PU(wN, i) = HlmfK) + Hlmb(w^)",
        "We assume that the higher the predictive uncertainty is, the more likely the left or right part of the word boundary can be \"cut-and-pasted\" to form another reasonable sentence.",
        "So a good phrase is characterized with high PU values on the boundaries.",
        "For example, in 'we want to have a table near the window , the PU value of the point after 'table is 0.61, higher than that between 'near' and 'the' 0.3, using trigram LMs.",

        "After reaching its peak, the BLEU score drops as the threshold t increases.",
        "When t is large enough, the translation performance is not changing much but still worse than the peak value.",
        "It implies a balancing process between precision and recall.",
        "The final optimal threshold t is around 5.",
        "The flexibility is also enabled by multiple configurable features used to evaluate the quality of a phrase and a phrase pair.",
        "Ideally, a perfect combination of feature functions divides the correct and incorrect candidate phrase pairs within a parallel sentence into two ordered separate sets.",
        "We use feature functions to decide the order and the threshold t to locate the boundary guided with a development set.",
        "So the main issue to investigate now is which features are important and valuable in ranking candidate phrase pairs.",
        "We propose several information metrics derived from posterior distribution, language model and word alignments as feature functions.",
        "The ViterbiExtract is a special case where a single binary feature function defined from word alignments is used.",
        "Its good performance (as shown in Table 3) suggests that word alignments are very indicative of phrase pair quality.",
        "So we design comparative experiments to capture word alignment impact only.",
        "We start with basic features that include model-based posterior, bilingual and monolingual information metrics.",
        "Its results on different test sets are presented in the \"basic\" row of Table 4.",
        "We add word alignment feature (\"+align\" row), and then apply bilinear transform to the consistency ratio WPPCR as described in section 3.4 (\"+align_BLT\" row).",
        "The parameter controlling the degree of attenuation in BLT is also optimized together with other feature weights.",
        "With the basic features, the new phrase extraction approach performs better than the baseline method with HMM word alignment models but similar to the baseline method with Model-4.",
        "With the word alignment based feature WPPCR, we obtain a 2% improvement on 04test set but not much on other sets except slight degradation on 06test.",
        "Finally, applying BLT transform to WPPCR leads to additional 0.8 BLEU point on 06dev set and 1.2 point on 06test set.",
        "This confirms the effectiveness of word alignment based features.",
        "Now we compare the phrase table using the proposed method to that extracted using the baseline ViterbiExtract method with Model-4 word alignments.",
        "The Venn diagram in Table 5 shows how the two phrase tables overlap with each other and size of each part.",
