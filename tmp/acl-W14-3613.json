        "The Arabic Dialects have become increasingly used in social networks and web 2.0 (blogs, fo-rums, newspaper, newsgroups, etc.)",
        "instead of Standard Arabic (SA).",
        "Consequently, new kinds of texts appeared being mainly dialect-written or having a mixture between Arabic Dialects and Standard Arabic.",
        "Thus, innovative opportunities and challenges arise when we try to deal with the automatic processing of such data in order to seek out useful information and take advantages of their growing availability and popularity.",
        "The NLP approaches generally applied lexical resources for the target language.",
        "Such resources are useful in several tasks which involve a language meaning understanding like: opinion mining (Kim et al., 2004; Bouchlaghem et al. 2010), information retrieval (Valeras et al., 2005; Rosso et al., 2004), query expansion (Parapar et al., 2005), text categorization (Rosso et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al., 2003), and many other applications.",
        "However, this situation poses significant difficulties in the context of dialectal data because of the huge lack of Dialect-Standard Arabic lexical resources.",
        "Building similar ones is a big challenge since spoken dialects are not officially written, don't have a standard orthography and are considered as under-resourced languages, unlike standard languages.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of creating a linguistic resource for an Arabic dialect.",
        "We describe our approach towards building a Wordnet for Tunisian dialect (TD).",
        "We proceed, first-ly, to construct a TD corpus by collecting data from various resources (social networks, web-sites, TD dictionaries, etc.).",
        "We develop a clustering based method that aims to organize the TD corpus words by grouping them into clusters.",
        "The suggested organization possibilities are, then, analyzed and validated by the TD experts during the TunDiaWN enrichment process.",
        "Our proposed database structure is designed to be able to highlight the specificities of the TD lexicon.",
        "It also takes advantage of Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), the Arabic version of the widely used lexico-semantic resource Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "This can be justified by the assumption that Tunisian Arabic has a great resemblance with Standard Arabic.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we begin by presenting works related to existing wordnets and approaches focused on the auto-Rim Faiz LARODEC, IHEC de Carthage, 2016 Carthage Pr?sidence, Tunisie Rim.Faiz@ihec.rnu.tn 104 matic processing of the Tunisian dialect.",
        "We then introduce the posed challenges and the hypothesis we have assumed in building the TunDiaWN.",
        "In the next section, we proceed to explain and justify the proposed approach for developing the initial version of the Tunisian Arabic lexical resource.",
        "Firstly, we detail the TD data collect process and the MultiTD corpus construction.",
        "Sec-ondly, we present the method developed to suggest possible organizations of TD words extracted from the corpus.",
        "Then, we describe the proposed structure of TunDiaWN, especially the new added features and entities as well as the validation task performed by the TD experts.",
        "In the following section, we perform a linguistic analysis by reporting significant observations related to TD-SA discovered during the enrichment process.",
        "Conclusion and future works are presented in section 5.",
        "2 Related works The first version of wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) was developed for English at Princeton University.",
        "It's a large lexical database where words having the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjec-tives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each one expressing a distinct concept.",
        "Each word can belong to one or more synsets.",
        "The resulting synsets are connected by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations well labeled such as hyponymy and an-tonymy.",
        "The success of the Princeton WordNet has motivated the development of similar resources for other languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN (Vossen, 1998) interlinking wordnets of several European languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian); Balkanet (Tufis, 2004) comprising wordnets of the Balkan languages; and recently Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006).",
        "AWN was released following methods developed for EuroWordNet.",
        "These methods revolve about the manual encoding of a set of Common Base Concepts (CBC), the most important concepts from the 12 languages in EWN and Bal-kaNet.",
        "Other language-specific concepts are added and translated manually to the closest syn-set(s) in Arabic.",
        "Such resource aims to link ara-bic words and synsets to english ones.",
        "AWN is related to the Classical Arabic (or Literal Arabic) which refers to the official standard form of the Arabic language used in Arab world.",
        "Other variants of Arabic are dialects which are spoken and informal.",
        "They are the primary form of Arabic Language.",
        "The Tunisian dialect (cf. Table 1) or ?Darija?",
        "is one of the Maghreb Dialects and is mainly spoken by Tunisian people (Baccouche, 1994).",

        "foluws money ???????",
        "baro$aA many ???????",
        "maAlah then Table 1.",
        "Examples of popular TD words Most of the works that dealt with the automatic processing of Tunisian dialect are based on spoken dialogue corpus.",
        "To mention, Graja et al. (2011) performed a lexical study of manual transcription of conversations recorded in the railway station for understanding speech.",
        "The application is domain dependant and, thus, the vocabulary is limited.",
        "Moreover, Zribi et al. (2013) introduced a lexicon for the Tunisian dialect in order to adapt an existing morphological analyzer initially designed for Standard Arabic.",
        "Although the method shows good results, the proposed lexicon is far to be complete.",
        "Boujelbane et al. (2013) presented a method that aims to construct bilingual dictionary using explicit knowledge about the relation between Tunisian dialect and Standard Arabic.",
        "This approach was limited to the verbs.",
        "3 Challenges In the last years, Tunisian dialect is widely used in new written media and web 2.0, especially in social networks, blogs, forums, weblogs, etc., in addition to conversational media (Diab et al., 2007).",
        "Thinking about building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect is a big challenge.",
        "In fact, like most of dialects around the world, Tunisian Arabic is considered as spoken language with no conventional written form.",
        "Moreover, there is a lack of Tunisian dialect-Standard Arabic resources and tools.",
        "Recently, Cavalli-Sforza et al. (2013) proposed a process for creating a basic Iraqi Dialect Word-Net.",
        "This work is based on other languages wordnets as well as a bidirectional English-Iraqi Arabic dictionary.",
        "To our knowledge, no other open source Wordnet for the Standard Arabic or Arabic Dialect has been developed to date.",
        "To deal with these difficulties, we decide to produce a TD corpus gathering texts from multiple 105 sources.",
        "This corpus provides a useful starting point for building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect.",
        "We assume that Arabic Dialects can be presumed to be similar to Standard Arabic, particularly in their conceptual organization.",
        "Indeed, the Tunisian dialect has a sophisticated form which combines Standard Arabic and Tunisian dialect specific forms.",
        "It has a great resemblance to the SA and adds some variances such as foreign words borrowed from other languages.",
        "Thus, given the similarities between the TD and the SA, the resources available to SA, such as AWN, can be favorably used for creating Tunisian dialectal resources.",
        "4 Proposed approach for TunDiaWN construction The classical building WordNets methodologies start from the CBC, and then make changes according to the concerned language.",
        "We propose a new corpus-based approach to create WordNet resource for Tunisian dialect, which deviates from the strategies commonly adopted.",
        "As shows Figure 1, our approach is performed in four steps: a. Tunisian dialect textual data collect: it consists in producing our MultiTD corpus (Mul- ti-source Tunisian dialect corpus) which gathers TD texts from many sources: social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.",
        "), written pieces of theater, dictionaries, transcriptions of spontaneous speech, etc.",
        "b. TD words extraction: is to preprocess the produced corpus in order to preserve useful data and extract TD words.",
        "c. TD words clustering: we propose here a clustering based method that aims to group the extracted TD words into meaningful clusters, which represent great suggestions for possible enrichments of TunDiaWN.",
        "d. TunDiaWN enrichment: this step is performed by the TD experts.",
        "It includes the manual validation of the suggestions proposed by the previous step.",
        "We propose, in this stage, a new database structure for TunDiaWN.",
        "The experts have to add the necessary features values, particularly the TD specific attributes (details in section 4.4).",
        "4.1 TD data collection and MultiTD corpus presentation We set out to collect data for Tunisian dialect in order to address the general lack of resources, on the one hand, and to produce a multi source corpus, on the other.",
        "We created the MultiTD corpus by gathering TD data from diverse sources.",
        "The most practical source of TD texts is online data, which is more individual-driven and less formal, and consequently more likely to comprise dialectal contents.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Proposed approach of TunDiaWN building 106 We automatically collected a great amount of TD texts from user's comments and status from Twitter, Facebook and TripAdviser.",
        "We have implemented three specific modules: ?",
        "TwtterCollecter based on Twitter4j java api, ?",
        "FacebookAspirator using a PHP script and a Facebook account developer, ?",
        "TripadvisorScreen a java module to analyze Tripadvisor web pages and extract comments forms.",
        "Manual transcriptions of TD recorded spontaneous speech are also added to the MultiTD corpus.",
        "Such data allows highlighting the Tunisian accent in the dialogue and, therefore, enriching the corpus by new varieties of the TD lexicon.",
        "Other online available TD resources are used to enrich the MultiTD corpus.",
        "We cite notably, the Karmous dictionary for Tunisian Arabic1 which comprises more than 3,800 TD words and several Tunisian proverbs and expressions organized by themes.",
        "We use also an online TD dictionary 2 consisting of over 4,000 words and expressions; and many short TD texts3 related to various areas: songs, theater, newspaper articles, etc.",
        "4.2 TD words extraction To successfully extract all TD words, the input texts must be preprocessed.",
        "In our study, the preprocessing consists, firstly, to clean the input files so as to identify the textual content.",
        "The cleaned texts are then segmented in order to extract all existing TD words.",
        "Cleaning a raw textual source is necessary in our approach because the documents are collected from the Web.",
        "All non-textual data such as im-ages, advertisements, scripts, etc.",
        "have to be eliminated.",
        "For this purpose, we have developed a module that removes all unwanted parts from the input documents.",
        "The cleaned texts are then segmented into elementary textual units and the obtained TD words are extracted and stored in CSV files.",
        "The Table 2 gives statistics about the TD words composing the MultiTD corpus.",

        "The manual analysis and organization of such large data looks wasteful and time consuming.",
        "In order to support experts in the organization and validation tasks and guide them during the construction process, we propose a clustering-based method to automatically arrange the TD words set into groups.",
        "The method aims to suggest possible organizations of the given TD words by gathering them into meaningful clusters.",
        "To enhance similarities and meanings into the produced groups, we propose to cluster the TD words according to their TD roots.",

        "Our aim at this step is to group words having the same root.",
        "To do this task, we apply and adapt the K-modes clustering algorithm (Huang, 1997).",
        "The K-modes algorithm extends K-means (For- gy, 1965; MacQueen, 1967) paradigm to cluster categorical data by removing the numeric data limitation.",
        "Indeed, the K-modes algorithm introduces a new simple matching dissimilarity measure for categorical data objects.",
        "The algorithm replaces means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency based method to update modes in the clustering process.",
        "The choice of K-modes clustering algorithm is mainly motivated because of its widely use in real world applications due to its efficiency in dealing with large categorical database (He et al., 2011).",
        "K-modes algorithm is also faster than other clustering algorithms (mainly k-means) since it needs less iteration to produce a stable distribution.",
        ".",
        "The K-modes algorithm requires a similarity measurement to be used between the objects.",
        "In our case, we propose to use the N-Gram similarity measurement between words.",
        "N-Gram is language independent in nature and doesn't require specific resources to be applied.",
        "Therefore, N-gram model seems suitable for dealing with a Tunisian dialect context.",
        "We applied the N-Gram distance proposed by Kondrak (2005) and we used the implementation provided by Apache Lucene spellchecking API5.",
        "The K-modes algorithm consists of the following steps: a) Select K initial modes, one for each of the cluster.",
        "5 The project can be freely obtained from: http://lucene.apache.org/core/ b) Allocate data object to the cluster whose mode is nearest to it, according to the simple matching dissimilarity c) Compute new modes of all clusters.",
        "d) Repeat step b to c until no data object has changed cluster membership.",
        "The classical K-modes algorithm assumes that the number of clusters, K, is known in advance and the clusters?",
        "modes are randomly initialized.",
        "The K-modes algorithm is very sensitive to these choices and an improper choice may then yield highly undesirable cluster structures.",
        "(Khan et al., 2013).",
        "In order to deal with these drawbacks and, there-after, maximize the performance of the algo-rithm, we propose a new initialization strategy for the k-modes algorithm.",
        "Indeed, since our goal is to cluster words according to their roots, the TD roots are assigned to clusters modes in the initialization step instead of random initialization.",
        "The number of clusters (K) will, thus, take the cardinality of the target TD roots set.",
        "Therefore, the K-modes algorithm starts with k clusters each having as mode one root among the TD roots list initially translated.",
        "We have also adopted a new strategy based on the N-Gram similarity measurement to update clusters?",
        "modes.",
        "The modes update is performed at the end of each iteration.",
        "For each cluster, the item qualified as new cluster mode must maximize the similarity sum with the rest of cluster objects.",
