        "Recently comparable corpora have got great attention in the field of NLP.",
        "Extracting parallel fragments of texts, paraphrases or sentences from comparable corpora are particularly useful for any statistical machine translation system (SMT) (Smith et al. 2010) as the size of the parallel corpus plays major role in any SMT performance.",
        "Extracted parallel phrases from comparable corpora are added with the training corpus as additional data that is expected to facilitate better performance of machine translation systems specifically for those language pairs which have limited parallel resources available.",
        "In this work, we try to extract English-Bengali parallel fragments of text from comparable corpora.",
        "We have developed an aligned corpus of English-Bengali document pairs using Wikipedia.",
        "Wikipedia is a huge collection of documents in many different languages.",
        "We first collect an English document from Wikipedia and then follow the inter-language link to find the same document in Bengali (obviously, if such a link exists).",
        "In this way, we create a small corpus.",
        "We assume that such English-Bengali document pairs from Wikipedia are already comparable since they talk about the same entity.",
        "Although each English-Bengali document pair talks about the same entity, most of the times they are not exact translation of each other.",
        "And as a result, parallel fragments of text are rarely found in these document pairs.",
        "The bigger the size of the fragment the less probable it is to find its parallel version in the target side.",
        "Nevertheless, there is always chance of getting parallel phrase, tokens or even sentences in comparable documents.",
        "The challenge is to find those parallel texts which can be useful in increasing machine translation performance.",
        "In our present work, we have concentrated on finding small fragments of parallel text instead of rigidly looking for parallelism at entire sentential level.",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2006) believed that comparable corpora tend to have parallel data at sub-sentential level.",
        "This approach is particularly useful for this type of corpus under consideration, because there is a very little chance of getting exact translation of bigger fragments of text in the target side.",
        "Instead, searching for parallel chunks would be more logical.",
        "If a sentence in the source side has a parallel sentence in the target side, then all of its chunks need to have their parallel translations in the target side as well.",
        "It is to be noted that, although we have document level alignment in our corpus, it is somehow ad-hoc i.e. the documents in the corpus do not belong to any particular domain.",
        "Even with such a corpus we have been able to improve the performance of an existing machine translation system built on tourism domain.",
        "This also signifies our contribution towards domain adaptation of machine translation systems.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "Most of the strategies follow a standard method based on context similarity.",

        "The basis of the method is to find the target words that have the most similar distributions with a given source word.",
        "The starting point of this method is a list of bilingual expressions that are used to build the context vectors of all words in both languages.",
        "This list is usually provided by an external bilingual dictionary.",
        "In Gamallo (2007), however, the starting list is provided by bilingual correlations which are previously extracted from a parallel corpus.",
        "In Dejean (2002), the method relies on a multilingual thesaurus instead of an external bilingual dictionary.",
        "In all cases, the starting list contains the ?seed expressions?",
        "required to build context vectors of the words in both languages.",
        "The works based on this standard approach mainly differ in the coefficients used to measure the context vector similarity.",
        "Otero et al. (2010) showed how Wikipedia could be used as a source of comparable corpora in different language pairs.",
        "They downloaded the entire Wikipedia for any two language pair and transformed it into a new collection: CorpusPedia.",
        "However, in our work we have showed that only a small ad-hoc corpus containing Wikipedia articles could be proved to be beneficial for existing MT systems."
