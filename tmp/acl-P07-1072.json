        "Semantic knowledge is very important for any application that requires a deep understanding of natural language.",
        "The automatic acquisition of semantic information in text has become increasingly important in ontology development, information extraction, question answering, and other advanced natural language processing applications.",
        "In this paper we present a model for the automatic semantic interpretation of noun phrases (NPs), which is the task of determining the semantic relation among the noun constituents.",
        "For example, family estate encodes a possession relation, while dress of silk refers to PART-WHOLE.",
        "The problem, while simple to state is hard to solve.",
        "The reason is that the meaning of these constructions is most of the time ambiguous or implicit.",
        "Interpreting NPs correctly requires various types of information from world knowledge to complex context features.",
        "Moreover, the extension of this task to other natural languages brings forward new issues and problems.",
        "For instance, beer glass translates into tarro de cerveza in Spanish, bicchiere da birra in Italian, verre a biere in French, and pahar de bere in Romanian.",
        "Thus, an important research question is how do the syntactic constructions in the target language contribute to the preservation of meaning in context.",
        "In this paper we investigate noun phrases based on cross-linguistic evidence and present a domain independent model for their semantic interpretation.",
        "We aim at uncovering the general aspects that govern the semantics of NPs in English based on a set of five Romance languages: Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian.",
        "The focus on Romance languages is well motivated.",
        "It is mostly true that English noun phrases translate into constructions of the form N P N in Romance languages where, as we will show below, the P (preposition) varies in ways that correlate with the semantics.",
        "Thus Romance languages will give us another source of evidence for disambiguating the semantic relations in English NPs.",
        "We also present empirical observations on the distribution of the syntax and meaning of noun phrases on two different corpora based on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer's set of 8 prepositions (Lauer, 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.",
        "We show that various crosslin-gual cues can help in the NP interpretation task when employed in an SVM model.",
        "The results are compared against two state of the art approaches: a supervised machine learning model, Semantic Scattering (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005), and a web-based probabilistic model (Lapata and Keller, 2004).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present a summary of the previous work.",
        "Section 3 lists the syntactic and semantic interpretation categories used along with observations regarding their distribution on the two different cross-lingual corpora.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present a learning model and results for the interpretation of English noun phrases.",

        "Currently, the best-performing NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances (noun compounds) and rely either on rather ad-hoc, domain-specific semantic taxonomies, or on statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data.",
        "Recent results have shown that symbolic noun compound interpretation systems using machine learning techniques coupled with a large lexical hierarchy perform with very good accuracy, but they are most of the time tailored to a specific domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001).",
        "On the other hand, the majority of corpus statistics approaches to noun compound interpretation collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun constituents and use them in a probabilistic model (Lauer, 1995).",
        "More recently, (Lapata and Keller, 2004) showed that simple unsupervised models perform significantly better when the frequencies are obtained from the web, rather than from a large standard corpus.",
        "Other researchers (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Snow et al., 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify is-a relations in large text collections.",
        "(Kim and Baldwin, 2006) and (Tur-ney, 2006) focus on the lexical similarity of unseen noun compounds with those found in training.",
        "However, although the web-based solution might overcome the data sparseness problem, the current probabilistic models are limited by the lack of deep linguistic information.",
        "In this paper we investigate the role of cross-linguistic information in the task of English NP semantic interpretation and show the importance of a set of novel linguistic features."

        "For a better understanding of the meaning of the N N and N P N instances, we analyzed the semantic behavior of these constructions on a large cross-linguistic corpora of examples.",
        "We are interested in what syntactic constructions are used to translate the English instances to the target Romance languages and vice-versa, what semantic relations do these constructions encode, and what is the corpus distribution ofthe semantic relations.",
        "Although the NP interpretation problem has been studied for a long time, researchers haven't agreed on the number and the level of abstraction of these semantic categories.",
        "They can vary from a few prepositions (Lauer, 1995) to hundreds or thousands specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).",
        "The more abstract the categories, the more noun phrases are covered, but also the more room for variation as to which category a phrase should be assigned.",
        "In this paper we experiment with two state of the art classification sets used in NP interpretation.",
        "The first is a core set of 22 semantic relations (22 SRs) identified by us from the computational linguistics literature.",
        "This list, presented in Table 1 along with examples is general enough to cover a large majority of text semantics while keeping the semantic relations to a manageable number.",
        "The second set is Lauer's list of 8 prepositions (8 PP) and can be applied only to noun compounds (of for, with, in, on, at, about, and from - e.g., according to this classification, love story can be classified as story about love).",
        "We selected these sets as they are of different size and contain semantic classification categories at different levels of abstraction.",
        "Lauer's list is more abstract and, thus capable of encoding a large number of noun compound instances, while the 22-SR list contains finer grained semantic categories.",
        "We show below the coverage of these semantic lists on two different corpora and how well they solve the interpretation problem of noun phrases.",
        "The data was collected from two text collections with different distributions and of different genre,",
        "POSSESSION (family estate); KINSHIP (sister of the boy); PROPERTY (lubricant viscosity); AGENT (return of the natives); THEME (acquisition of stock); TEMPORAL (morning news); DEPICTION-DEPICTED (a picture of my niece); PART-WHOLE (brush hut); HYPERNYMY (IS-A) (daisy flower); CAUSE (scream of pain); MAKE/PRODUCE (chocolate factory); INSTRUMENT (laser treatment); LOCATION (castle in the desert); PURPOSE (cough syrup); SOURCE (grapefruit oil); TOPIC (weather report); MANNER (performance with passion); beneficiary (rights of citizens); MEANS (bus service); EXPERIENCER (fear of the girl); MEASURE (cup of sugar); TYPE (framework law);",
        "Europarl and CLUVI.",
        "The Europarl data was assembled by combining the Spanish-English, Italian-English, French-English and Portuguese-English corpora which were automatically aligned based on exact matches of English translations.",
        "Then, we considered only the English sentences which appeared verbatim in all four language pairs.",
        "The resulting English corpus contained 10,000 sentences which were syntactically parsed (Charniak, 2000).",
        "From these we extracted the first 3,000 NP instances (NN: 48.82% andNPN: 51.18%).",
        "CLUVI is an open text repository of parallel corpora of contemporary oral and written texts in some of the Romance languages.",
        "Here, we focused only on the English-Portuguese and English-Spanish parallel texts from the works of John Steinbeck, H. G. Wells, J. Salinger, and others.",
        "Using the CLUVI search interface we created a sentence-aligned parallel corpus of 2,800 English-Spanish and English-Portuguese sentences.",
        "The English versions were automatically parsed after which each N N and N P N instance thus identified was manually mapped to the corresponding translations.",
        "The resulting corpus contains 2,200 English instances with a distribution of 26.77% N N and 73.23% N P N.",
        "For each corpus, each NP instance was presented separately to two experienced annotators in a web interface in context along with the English sentence and its translations.",
        "Since the corpora do not cover some of the languages (Romanian in Europarl and CLUVI, and Italian and French in CLUVI), three other native speakers of these languages and fluent in English provided the translations which were added to the list.",
        "The two computational semantics annotators had to tag each English constituent noun with its corresponding WordNet sense and each instance with the corresponding semantic category.",
        "If the word was not found in WordNet the instance was not considered.",
        "Whenever the annotators found an example encoding a semantic category other than those provided or they didn't know what interpretation to give, they had to tag it as \"other-sr\", and respectively \"other-pp\".",
        "The details of the annotation task and the observations drawn from there are presented in a companion paper (Girju, 2007).",
        "The corpus instances used in the corpus analysis phase have the following format: <npEn ;npes; np/t; npFr; NPport; npr0; target>.",
        "The word target is one of the 23 (22 + other-sr) semantic relations and one of the eight prepositions considered or other-pp (with the exception of those N P N instances that already contain a preposition).",
        "For example, <development cooperation; cooperacion para el desarrollo; cooperazione alio sviluppo; cooperation au developpement; cooperare pentru dezvoltare; purpose / for>.",
        "The annotators' agreement was measured using",
        "Kappa statistics: K = Pr|APrpE)E), where Pr(A) is the proportion of times the annotators agree and Pr(E) is the probability of agreement by chance.",
        "The Kappa values were obtained on Europarl (N N:",
        "the number of pairs that were tagged with other by both annotators for each semantic relation and preposition paraphrase, over the number of examples classified in that category by at least one of the judges (in Europarl: 91% for 8-PP and 78% for 22-SR; in CLUVI: 86% for 8-PP and 69% for 22-SR).",
        "The agreement obtained on the Europarl corpus is higher than the one on CLUVI on both classification sets.",
        "This is partially explained by the distribution of semantic relations in both corpora, as will be shown in the next subsection.",
        "From the sets of 2,954 (Europarl) and 2,168 (CLUVI) instances resulted after annotation, the data show that over 83% of the translation patterns for both text corpora on all languages were of the type N N and N P N. However, while their distribution is balanced in the Europarl corpus (about 45%, in CLUVI the N P N constructions occur in more than 85% of the cases (again, with the exception of Romanian - 50%).",
        "It is interesting to note here that some of the English NPs are translated into both noun-noun and noun-adjective compounds in the target languages.",
        "For example, love affair translates in Italian as storia d'amore or the noun-adjective compound relazione amorosa.",
        "There are also instances that have just one word correspondent in the target language (e.g., ankle boot is bottine in French).",
        "The rest of the data is encoded by other syntactic paraphrases (e.g., bomb site is luogo dove e esplosa la bomba (It.)).",
        ".",
        "From the initial corpus we considered those English instances that had all the translations encoded only by N N and N P N. Out of these, we selected only 1,023 Europarl and 1,008 CLUVI instances encoded by N N and N P N in all languages considered and resulted after agreement."

        "Thus, since we wanted to measure the impact of these ambiguities of noun compounds on the interpretation performance, we further tested the probabilistic web-based model on four distinct test sets selected from Europarl, each containing 30 noun noun pairs encoding different types of ambiguity: in set#1 the noun constituents had only one part of speech and one WordNet sense; in set#2 the nouns had at least two possible parts of speech and were semantically unambiguous, in set#3 the nouns were ambiguous only semantically, and in set#4 they were ambiguous both syntactically and semantically.",

        "This shows that for more semantically ambiguous noun - noun pairs, the web-based probabilistic model introduces a significant number of false positives.",
        "Thus, the more abstract the categories, the more noun compounds are covered, but also the more room for variation as to which category a compound should be assigned."
