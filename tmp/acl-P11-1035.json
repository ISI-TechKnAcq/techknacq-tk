        "The coverage of contentious issues of a community is an essential function of journalism.",
        "Contentious issues continuously arise in various domains, such as politics, economy, environment; each issue involves diverse participants and their different complex arguments.",
        "However, news articles are frequently biased and fail to fairly deliver conflicting arguments of the issue.",
        "It is difficult for ordinary readers to analyze the conflicting arguments and understand the contention; they mostly perceive the issue passively, often through a single article.",
        "Advanced news delivery models are required to increase awareness on conflicting views.",
        "In this paper, we present disputant relation-based method for classifying news articles on contentious issues.",
        "We observe that the disputants of a contention, i.e., people who take a position and participate in the contention such as politicians, companies, stakeholders, civic groups, experts, commentators, etc., are an important feature for understanding the discourse.",
        "News producers primarily shape an article on a contention by selecting and covering specific disputants (Baker.",
        "1994).",
        "Readers also intuitively understand the contention by identifying who the opposing disputants are.",
        "The method helps readers intuitively view the news articles through the opponent-based frame.",
        "It performs classification in an unsupervised manner: it dynamically identifies opposing disputant groups and classifies the articles according to their positions.",
        "As such, it effectively helps readers contrast articles of a contention and attain balanced understanding, free from specific biased viewpoints.",
        "The proposed method differs from those used in related tasks as it aims to perform classification under the opponent-based frame.",
        "Research on sentiment classification and debate stance recognition takes a topic-oriented view, and attempts to perform classification under the 'positive vs. negative' or 'for vs. against' frame for the given topic, e.g., positive vs. negative about iPhone.",
        "However, such frames are often not appropriate for classifying news articles of a contention.",
        "The coverage of a contention often spans over different topics (Miller.",
        "2001).",
        "For the contention on the health care bill, an article may discuss the enlarged coverage whereas another may discuss the increase of insurance premiums.",
        "In addition, we observe that opposing arguments of a contention are often complex to classify under these frames.",
        "For example, in a political contention on holding a referendum on the Sejong project, the opposition parties strongly opposed and criticized the president office.",
        "Meanwhile, the president office argued that they were not considering holding the referendum and the contention arose from a misunderstanding.",
        "In such a case, it is difficult to classify any argument to the \"positive\" category of the frame.",
        "We demonstrate that the opponent-based frame is clear and effective for contrasting opposing views of contentious issues.",
        "For the contention on the referendum, ' president office vs. opposition parties' provides an intuitive frame to understand the contention.",
        "The frame does not require the documents to discuss common topics nor the opposing arguments to be positive vs. negative.",
        "Under the proposed frame, it becomes important to analyze which side is more centrally covered in an article.",
        "Unlike debate posts or product reviews news articles, in general, do not take a position explicitly (except a few types such as editorials).",
        "They instead quote a specific side, elaborate them, and provide supportive facts.",
        "On the other hand, the opposing disputants compete for news coverage to influence more readers and gain support (Miller et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Thus, the method focuses on identifying the disputants of each side and classifying the articles based on the side it covers.",
        "We applied a modified version of HITS algorithm to identify the key opponents of an issue, and used disputant extraction techniques combined with an SVM classifier for article analysis.",
        "We observe that the method achieves acceptable performance for practical use with basic language resources and tools, i.e., Named Entity Recognizer and a translated positive/negative lexicon.",
        "As we deal with non-English (Korean) news articles, it is difficult to obtain rich resources and tools, e.g., WordNet, dependency parser, annotated corpus such as MPQA.",
        "When applied to English, we believe the method could be further improved by adopting them."

      "text": [
        "Research has been made on sentiment classification in document-level (Turney et al., 2002, Pang et al., 2002, Seki et al.",
        "2008, Ounis et al.",
        "2006).",
        "It aims to automatically identify and classify the sentiment of documents into positive or negative.",
        "Opinion summarization aims a similar goal, to identify different opinions on a topic and generate summaries of them.",
        "Paul et al.",
        "(2010) developed an unsupervised method for generating summaries of contrastive opinions on a common topic.",
        "These works make a number of assumptions that are difficult to apply to the discourse of contentious news issues.",
        "They assume that the input documents have a common opinion target, e.g., a movie.",
        "Many of them primarily deal with documents which explicitly reveal opinions on the selected target, e.g., movie reviews.",
        "They usually apply one static classification frame, positive vs. negative, to the topic.",
        "The discourse of contentious issues in news articles show different characteristics from that studied in the sentiment classification tasks.",
        "First, the opponents of a contentious issue often discuss different topics, as discussed in the example above.",
        "Research in mass communication has showed that opposing disputants talk across each other, not by dialogue, i.e., they martial different facts and interpretations rather than to give different answers to the same topics (Schon et al., 1994).",
        "Second, the frame of argument is not fixed as ' positive vs. negative'.",
        "We frequently observed both sides of a contention articulating negative arguments attacking each other.",
        "The forms of arguments are also complex and diverse to classify them as positive or negative; for example, an argument may just neglect the opponent's argument without positive or negative expressions, or emphasize a different discussion point.",
        "In addition, a position of a contention can be communicated without explicit expression of opinion or sentiment.",
        "It is often conveyed through objective sentences that include carefully selected facts.",
        "For example, a news article can cast a negative light on a government program simply by covering the increase of deficit caused by it.",
        "A number of works deal with debate stance recognition, which is a closely related task.",
        "They attempt to identify a position of a debate, such as ideological (Somasundaran et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2006) or product comparison debate (So-masundaran et al., 2009).",
        "They assume a debate frame, which is similar to the frame of the sentiment classification task, i.e., for vs. against the debate topic.",
        "All articles of a debate in their corpus cover a coherent debate topic, e.g., iPhone vs. Blackberry, and explicitly express opinions for or against to the topic, e.g., for or against iPhone or Blackberry.",
        "The proposed methods assume that the debate frame is known apriori.",
        "This debate frame is often not appropriate for contentious issues for similar reasons as the positive/negative frame.",
        "In contrast, our method does not assume a fixed debate frame, and rather develops one based on the opponents of the contention at hand.",
        "The news corpus is also different from the debate corpus.",
        "News articles of a contentious issue are more diverse than debate articles conveying explicit argument of a specific side.",
        "There are news articles which cover both sides, facts without explicit opinions, and different topics unrelated to the arguments of either side.",
        "Several works have used the relation between speakers or authors for classifying their debate stance (Thomas et al., 2006, Agrawal et al., 2003).",
        "However, these works also assume the same debate frame and use the debate corpus, e.g., floor debates in the House of Representatives, online debate forums.",
        "Their approaches are also supervised, and require training data for relation analysis, e.g., voting records of congresspeople."

        "We conducted a user study to compare the opponent-based frame and the positive (for) vs. negative (against) frame.",
        "In the experiment, multiple human annotators classified the same set of news articles under each of the two frames.",
        "We compared which frame is clearer for the classification, and more effective for exposing opposing views.",
        "We selected 14 contentious issues from Naver News (a popular news portal in Korea) issue archive.",
        "We randomly sampled about 20 articles per each issue, for a total of 250 articles.",
        "The selected issues range over diverse domains such as politics, local, diplomacy, economy; to name a few for example, the contention on the 4 river project, of which the key opponents are the government vs. catholic church; the entrance of big retailers to the supermarket business, of which the key opponents are the small store owners vs. big retail companies; the refusal to approve an integrated civil servants' union, of which the key opponents are government vs. Korean government employees' union.",
        "We use an internationally known contention, i.e., the dispute about the Cheonan sinking incident, as an example to give more details on the disputants.",
        "Our data set includes 25 articles that were published after the South Korea's announcement of their investigation result.",
        "Many disputants appear in the articles, e.g., South Korean Government, South Korea defense secretary, North Korean Government, United States officials, Chinese experts, political parties of South Korea, etc.",
        "Three annotators performed the classification.",
        "All of them were students.",
        "For impartiality, two of them were recruited from outside the team, who were not aware of this research.",
        "The annotators performed two subtasks for classification.",
        "As for the positive vs. negative frame, first, we asked them to designate the main topic of the contention.",
        "Second, they classified the articles which mainly deliver arguments for the topic to the \"positive\" category and those delivering arguments against the topic to the \"negative\" category.",
        "The articles are classified to the \"Other\" category if they do not deal with the main topic nor cover positive or negative arguments.",
        "As for the opponent-based frame, first, we asked them to designate the competing opponents.",
        "Second, we asked to classify articles to a specific side if the articles cover only the positions, arguments, or information supportive of that side or if they cover information detrimental or criticism to its opposite side.",
        "Other articles were classified to the \"Other\" category.",
        "Examples of this category include articles covering both sides fairly, describing general background or implications of the issue.",
        "The agreement in classification was higher for the opponent-based frame in most issues.",
        "This indicates that the annotators could apply the frame more clearly, resulting in smaller difference between them.",

        "The kappa measure was less than 0.5 for near half of the issues under the positive-negative frame.",

        "Disputant relation-based method adopts the opponent-based frame for classification.",
        "It attempts to identify the two opposing groups of the issue at hand, and analyzes whether an article more reflects the position of a specific side.",
        "The method is based on the observation that there exists two opposing groups of disputants, and the groups compete for news coverage.",
        "They strive to influence readers' interpretation, evaluation of the issue and gain support from them (Miller et al.",
        "2001).",
        "In this competing process, news articles may give more chance of speaking to a specific side, explain or elaborate them, or provide supportive facts of that side (Baker 1994).",
        "The proposed method is performed in three stages: the first stage, disputant extraction, extracts the disputants appearing in an article set; the second stage, disputant partition, partitions the extracted disputants into two opposing groups; lastly, the news classification stage classifies the articles into three categories, i.e., two for the articles biased to each group, and one for the others.",
        "In this stage, the disputants who participate in the contention have to be extracted.",
        "We utilize that many disputants appear as the subject of quotes in the news article set.",
        "The articles actively quote or cover their action in order to deliver the contention lively.",
        "We used straight forward methods for extraction of subjects.",
        "The methods were effective in practice as quotes of articles frequently had a regular pattern.",
        "The subjects of direct and indirect quotes are extracted.",
        "The sentences including an utterance inside double quotes are considered as direct quotes.",
        "The sentences which convey an utterance without double quotes, and those describing the action of a disputant are considered as indirect quotes (See the translated example 1 below).",
        "The indirect quotes are identified based on the morphology of the ending word.",
        "The ending word of the indirect quotes frequently has a verb as its root or includes a verbalization suffix.",
        "Other sentences, typically, those describing the reporter's interpretation or comments are not considered as quotes.",
        "(See example sentence 2.",
        "The ending word of the original sentence is written in boldface).",
        "(1) The government clarified that there won't be any talks unless North Korea apologizes for the attack.",
        "(2) The government's belief is that a stern response is the only solution for the current crisis",
        "A named entity combined with a topic particle or a subject particle is identified as the subject of these quotes.",
        "We detect the name of an organization, person, or country using the Korean Named Entity Recognizer (Lee et al.",
        "2006).",
        "A simple anaphora resolution is conducted to identify subjects also from abbreviated references or pronouns in subsequent quotes.",
        "We develop key opponent-based partitioning method for disputant partitioning.",
        "The method first identifies two key opponents, each representing one side, and uses them as a pivot for partitioning other disputants.",
        "The other disputants are divided according to their relation with the key opponents, i.e., which key opponent they stand for or against.",
        "The intuition behind the method is that there usually exists key opponents who represent the contention, and many participants argue about the key opponents whereas they seldom recognize and talk about minor disputants.",
        "For instance, in the contention on \"investigation result of the Cheonan sinking incident\", the government of North Korea and that of South Korea are the key opponents; other disputants, such as politicians, experts, civic group of South Korea, the government of U.S., and that of China, mostly speak about the key opponents.",
        "Thus, it is effective to analyze where the disputants stand regarding their attitude toward the key opponents.",
        "Selecting key opponents: In order to identify the key opponents of the issue, we search for the disputants who frequently criticize, and are also criticized by other disputants.",
        "As the key opponents get more news coverage, they have more chance to articulate their argument, and also have more chance to face counterarguments by other disputants.",
        "This is done in two steps.",
        "First, for each disputant, we analyze whom he or she criticizes and by whom he or she is criticized.",
        "The method goes through each sentence of the article set and searches for both disputant's criticisms and the criticisms about the disputant.",
        "Based on the criticisms, it analyzes relationships among disputants.",
        "A sentence is considered to express the disputant's criticism to another disputant if the following holds: 1) the sentence is a quote, 2) the disputant is the subject of the quote, 3) another disputant appears in the quote, and 4) a negative lexicon appears in the sentence.",
        "On the other hand, if the disputant is not the subject but appears in the quote, the sentence is considered to express a criticism about the disputant made by another disputant (See example 3.",
        "The disputants are written in italic, and negative words are in boldface.",
        ").",
        "(3) the government defined that \"the attack of North Korea is an act of invasion and also a violation of North-South Basic Agreement\" The negative lexicon we use is carefully built from the Wilson lexicon (Wilson et al.",

        "We translated all the terms in it using the Google translation, and manually inspected the translated result to filter out inappropriate translations and the terms that are not negative in the Korean context.",
        "Second, we apply an adapted version of HITS graph algorithm to find major disputants.",
        "For this, the criticizing relationships obtained in the first step are represented in a graph.",

        "Each node, i.e., a web page, has two scores: the authority score, which reflects the value of inlinks toward itself, and the hub score, which reflects the value of its outlinks to others.",
        "The hub score of a node increases if it links to nodes with high authority score, and the authority score increases if it is pointed by many nodes with high hub score.",
        "We adopt the HITS algorithm due to above feature.",
        "It enables us to separately measure the significance of a disputant's criticism (using the hub score) and the criticism about the disputant (using the authority score).",
        "We aim to find the nodes which have both high hub score and high authority score; the key opponents will have many links to others and also be pointed by many nodes.",
        "The modified HITS algorithm is shown in Figure 2.",
        "We make some adaptation to make the algorithm reflect the disputants' characteristics.",

        "sentence.",
        "The number of such sentences is divided by the number of all quotes in which the two disputants appear and one appears as the subject.",

        "It measures the ratio of negative quotes between the two disputants.",

        "3) Frequency of Standing Together (FSTab): This feature attempts to capture whether the two disputants share a position, e.g., \"South Korea and U.S. both criticized North Korea for...\" It counts how many times they are co-located or connected with the conjunction \"and\" in the sentences.",

        "The effect of these false positives in article classification was limited.",
        "The recall was slightly lower than precision.",
        "This was mainly because some disputants were omitted in the disputant extraction stage.",
