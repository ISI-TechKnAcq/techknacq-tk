        "(2006)).",
        "Some of them employ language and/or type dependent linguistic knowledge for the task, while others employ independent statistical methods, such as Mutual Information and Log-likelihood (e.g. Pearce (2002) and, Zhang et al.",
        "(2006)), or even a combination of them (e.g.",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",

        "(2006), Ramisch et al.",
        "(2008)), there is also some work that deals with specific types of MWEs (e.g. Pearce (2002) on collocations and Villavicencio (2005) on verb-particle constructions (VPCs)) as each of these MWE types has distinct distributional and linguistic characteristics.",
        "VPCs are combinations of verbs and particles, such as take off in Our plane took off late, that due to their complex characteristics and flexible nature, provide a real challenge for NLP.",
        "In particular, there is a lack of adequate resources to identify and treat them, and those that are available provide only limited coverage, in face of the huge number of combinations in use.",
        "For tasks like parsing and generation, it is essential to know whether a given VPC is possible or not, to avoid for example using combinations that sound unnatural or ungrammatical to native speakers (e.g. give/lend/?grant out for the conveying of something to someone or some place - (Fraser, 1976)).",
        "Thus, the knowledge of which combinations are possible is crucial for precision grammar engineering.",
        "In addition, as the semantics of VPCs varies from the idiomatic to the more compositional cases, methods for the automatic detection and handling of idiomaticity are very important for any NLP task that involves some degree of semantic interpretation such as Machine Translation (in this case avoiding the problem of producing an unrelated translation for a source sentence).",

      "text": [
        "Particles in VPCs are characterised by containing features of motion-through-location and of completion or result in their core meaning (Bolinger, 1971).",
        "VPCs can range from idiosyncratic or semi-idiosyncratic combinations, such as get on (in e.g. Bill got on well with his new colleagues), to more regular ones, such as tear up (e.g. in In a rage she tore up the letter Jack gave her).",
        "A three way classification is adopted by (Dehe, 2002) and (Jack-endoff, 2002), where a VPC can be classified as compositional, idiomatic or aspectual, depending on its sense.",
        "In compositional VPCs the meaning of the construction is determined by the literal interpretations of the particle and the verb.",
        "These VPCs usually involve particles with directional or spatial meaning, and these can often be replaced by the appropriate directional PPs (e.g. carry in in Sheila carried the bags in/into the house Dehe (2002)).",
        "Idiomatic VPCs, on the other hand, cannot have their meaning determined by interpreting their components literally (e.g. get on, meaning to be on friendly terms with someone).",
        "The third class is that of aspectual VPCs, which have the particle providing the verb with an endpoint, suggesting that the action described by the verb is performed completely, thoroughly or continuously (e.g. tear up meaning to tear something into a lot of small pieces).",
        "From a syntactic point of view, a given combination can occur in several different subcategorisation frames.",
        "For example, give up can occur as an intransitive VPC (e.g. ml give up!",
        "Tell me the answer), where no other complement is required, or it may occur as a transitive VPC which requires a further NP complement (e.g. in She gave up alcohol while she was pregnant).",
        "Since in English particles tend to be homographs with prepositions (up, out, in), a verb followed by a preposition/particle and an NP can be ambiguous between a transitive VPC and a prepositional verb (e.g. rely on, in He relies on his wife for everything).",
        "Some criteria that characterise VPCs are discussed by Bolinger (1971):",
        "CI In a transitive VPC the particle may come either before or after the NP (e.g.",
        "He backed up the team vs.",
        "He backed the team up).",
        "However, whether a particle can be separated or not from the verb may depend on the degree of bonding between them, the size of the NP, and the kind of NP.",
        "This is considered by many to be sufficient condition for diagnosing a VPC, as prepositions can only appear in a position contiguous to the verb (e.g. *He got the bus off).",
        "C2 Unstressed personal pronouns must precede the particle (e.g.",
        "They ate it up but not *They ate up it).",
        "C3 If the particle precedes a simple definite NP, the particle does not take the NP as its object (e.g. in He brought along his girlfriend) unlike with PP complements or modifiers (e.g. in He slept in the hotel).",
        "This means that in the first example the NP is not a complement of the particle along, while in the second it is.",
        "In this paper we use the first two criteria, therefore the candidates may contain noise (in the form of prepositional verbs and related constructions).",
        "VPCs have been the subject of a considerable amount of interest, and some analysis has been done on the subject of productive VPCs.",
        "In many cases the particle seems to be compositionally adding a specific meaning to the construction and following a productive pattern (e.g. in tear up, cut up and split up, where the verbs are semantically related and up adds a sense of completion to the action of these verbs).",
        "Fraser (1976) points out that semantic properties of verbs can affect their ability to combine with particles: for example, bolt/cement/clamp/glue/paste/nail are semantically similar verbs where the objects represented by the verbs are used to join material, and they can all combine with down.",
        "There is clearly a common semantic thread running through this list, so that a new verb that is semantically similar to them can also be reasonably assumed to combine with down.",
        "Indeed, frequently new VPCs are formed by analogy with existing ones, where often the verb is varied and the particle remains (e.g. hang on, hold on and wait on).",
        "Similarly, particles from a given semantic class can be replaced by other particles from the same class in compositional combinations: send up/in/back/away (Wurmbrand, 2000).",
        "By identifying classes of verbs that follow patterns such as these in VPCs, we can help in the identification of a new unknown candidate combination, using the degree of productivity of a class to which the verb belongs as a back-off strategy.",
        "In terms of methods for automatic identification of VPCs from corpora, Baldwin (2005) proposes the extraction of VPCs with valence information from raw text, exploring a range of techniques (using (a) a POS tagger, (b) a chunker, (c) a chunk grammar, (d) a dependency parser, and (e) a combination of all methods).",
        "Villavicencio (2005) uses the Web as a corpus and productive patterns of combination to generate and validate candidate VPCs.",
        "The identification of compositionality in VPCs is addressed by McCarthy et al.",
        "(2003) who examine the overlap of similar words in an automatically acquired distributional thesaurus for verb and VPCs, and by Bannard (2005) who uses a distributional approach to determine when and to what extent the components of a VPC contribute their simplex meanings to the interpretation of the VPC.",

        "Q2 If it is a true VPC, is it idiomatic or compositional?",

        "Firstly, we consider that the elements of a true VPC co-occur above chance.",
        "The greater the correlation between the verb and the particle the greater the chance that the candidate is a true VPC.",
        "Secondly, based on criterion CI we also assume that VPCs have more flexible syntax and are more productive than non-VPCs.",
        "This second assumption goes against what is usually adopted for general MWEs, since it is the prepositional verbs that allow less syntactic configurations than VPCs and are therefore more rigid (§ 2).",
        "To further distinguish VPCs from prepositional verbs and other related constructions we also verify the possibility of the particle to be immediately followed by an indirect prepositional complement (like in The plane took off from London), which is a good indicator/delimiter of a VPC since in non-VPC constructions like prepositional verbs the preposition needs to have an NP complement.",
        "Therefore, we will assume that a true VPC occurs in the following configurations, according to Villavicencio (2005) and Ramisch et al.",

        "On the other hand, the algorithm selected the first, the smallest and the biggest of the Levin's sets.",
        "This probably happens because the majority of these verbs belongs only to one or two, but never to a great number of classes.",
        "Since the granularity of the classes is coarser than for synsets, the heuristics often offer four equal or very close entropies and thus redundant information.",
        "As an overall result, the last iteration shown in table 3 indicates a precision of 61.9% for the classifier in detecting idiomatic VPCs, that is to say that we automatically retrieved 176 VPCs where 67 are false positives and 109 are truly idiomatic.",
        "This value is a quality estimator for the resulting VPCs that will potentially be used in the construction of a lexicon.",
        "Recall of idiomatic VPCs goes from 16.7% to 24.9%."

        "One of the important challenges for robust natural language processing systems is to be able to successfully deal with Multiword Expressions and related constructions.",
        "We investigated the identification of VPCs using a combination of statistical methods and linguistic information, and whether there is a correlation between the productivity of VPCs and their semantics that could help us detect if a VPC is idiomatic or compositional.",
        "The results confirm that the use of statistical and linguistic information to automatically identify verb-particle constructions presents a reasonable way of improving coverage of existing lexical resources in a very simple and straightforward manner.",
        "In terms of grammar engineering, the information about compositional candidates belonging to productive classes provides us with the basis for constructing a family of fine-grained redundancy rules for these classes.",
        "These rules are applied in a constrained way to verbs already in the lexicon, according to their semantic classes.",
        "The VPCs identified as idiomatic, on the other hand, need to be explicitly added to the lexicon, after their semantic is determined.",
        "This study can also be complemented with the results of investigations into the semantics of VPCs, as discussed by both Bannard (2005) and McCarthy et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "In addition, the use of clustering methods is an interesting possibility for automatically identifying clusters of productive classes of both verbs and of particles that combine well together.",
