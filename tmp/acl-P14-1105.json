        "conservatives call the ?death tax?",
        "; there are no ideologically neutral alternatives (Lakoff, 2002).",
        "While objectivity remains an important principle of journalistic professionalism, scholars and watchdog groups claim that the media are biased (Groseclose and Milyo, 2005; Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010; Niven, 2003), backing up their assertions by publishing examples of obviously biased articles on their websites.",
        "Whether or not it reflects an underlying lack of objectivity, quantitative changes in the popular framing of an issue over time?favoring one ideologically-based position over another?can have a substantial effect on the evolution of policy (Dardis et al., 2008).",

        "In this pa-per, we examine the problem of detecting ideological bias on the sentence level.",
        "We say a sentence contains ideological bias if its author's political position (here liberal or conservative, in the sense of U.S. politics) is evident from the text.",
        "Ideological bias is difficult to detect, even for humans?the task relies not only on political knowledge but also on the annotator's ability to pick up on subtle elements of language use.",
        "For example, the sentence in Figure 1 includes phrases typically associated with conservatives, such as ?small businesses?",
        "and ?death tax?.",
        "When we take more of the structure into account, however, we find that scare quotes and a negative propositional attitude (a lie about X) yield an evident liberal bias.",
        "Existing approaches toward bias detection have not gone far beyond ?bag of words?",
        "classifiers, thus ignoring richer linguistic context of this kind and often operating at the level of whole documents.",
        "In contrast, recent work in sentiment analysis has used deep learning to discover compositional effects (Socher et al., 2011b; Socher et al., 2013b).",
        "Building from those insights, we introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) to detect ideological bias on the sentence level.",
        "This model requires 1113 wb = changew a = climate w d = so-called p c = climate change p e = so-called climate change x d = x c = x e = x a = x b = W L W R W R W L Figure 2: An example RNN for the phrase ?so- called climate change?.",
        "Two d-dimensional word vectors (here, d = 6) are composed to generate a phrase vector of the same dimensionality, which can then be recursively used to generate vectors at higher-level nodes.",
        "richer data than currently available, so we develop a new political ideology dataset annotated at the phrase level.",
        "With this new dataset we show that RNNs not only label sentences well but also improve further when given additional phrase-level annotations.",
        "RNNs are quantitatively more effective than existing methods that use syntactic and semantic features separately, and we also illustrate how our model correctly identifies ideological bias in complex syntactic constructions.",
        "2 Recursive Neural Networks Recursive neural networks (RNNs) are machine learning models that capture syntactic and semantic composition.",
        "They have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of sentence-level NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, paraphrase de-tection, and parsing (Socher et al., 2011a; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013).",
        "RNN models represent a shift from previous research on ideological bias detection in that they do not rely on hand-made lexicons, dictionaries, or rule sets.",
        "In this section, we describe a supervised RNN model for bias detection and highlight differences from previous work in training procedure and initialization.",
        "2.1 Model Description By taking into account the hierarchical nature of language, RNNs can model semantic composition, which is the principle that a phrase's meaning is a combination of the meaning of the words within that phrase and the syntax that combines those words.",
        "While semantic composition does not apply universally (e.g., sarcasm and idioms), most language follows this principle.",
        "Since most ideological bias becomes identifiable only at higher levels of sentence trees (as verified by our annota-tion, Figure 4), models relying primarily on word-level distributional statistics are not desirable for our problem.",
        "The basic idea behind the standard RNN model is that each word w in a sentence is associated with a vector representation x w ?",
        "R d .",
        "Based on a parse tree, these words form phrases p (Figure 2).",
        "Each of these phrases also has an associated vector x p ?",
        "R d of the same dimension as the word vectors.",
        "These phrase vectors should represent the meaning of the phrases composed of individual words.",
        "As phrases themselves merge into complete sentences, the underlying vector representation is trained to retain the sentence's whole meaning.",
        "The challenge is to describe how vectors combine to form complete representations.",
        "If two words w a and w b merge to form phrase p, we posit that the phrase-level vector is x p = f(W L ?",
        "x a +W R ?",
        "x b + b 1 ), (1) where W L and W R are d ?",
        "d left and right composition matrices shared across all nodes in the tree, b 1 is a bias term, and f is a nonlinear activation function such as tanh.",
        "The word-level vectors x a and x b come from a d ?",
        "V dimensional word embedding matrix W e , where V is the size of the vocabulary.",
        "We are interested in learning representations that can distinguish political polarities given labeled data.",
        "If an element of this vector space, x d , represents a sentence with liberal bias, its vector should be distinct from the vector x r of a conservative-leaning sentence.",
        "Supervised RNNs achieve this distinction by applying a regression that takes the node's vector x p as input and produces a prediction y?",
        "p .",
        "This is a softmax layer y?",

        "(6) 2.2 Initialization When initializing our model, we have two choices: we can initialize all of our parameters randomly or provide the model some prior knowledge.",
        "As we see in Section 4, these choices have a significant effect on final performance.",
        "Random The most straightforward choice is to initialize the word embedding matrix W e and composition matrices W L and W R randomly such that without any training, representations for words and phrases are arbitrarily projected into the vector space.",
        "word2vec The other alternative is to initialize the word embedding matrix W e with values that reflect the meanings of the associated word types.",
        "This improves the performance of RNN models over random initializations (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Socher et al., 2011a).",
        "We initialize our model with 300-dimensional word2vec toolkit vectors generated by a continuous skip-gram model trained on around 100 billion words from the Google News corpus (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "The word2vec embeddings have linear relationships (e.g., the closest vectors to the average of ?green?",
        "and ?energy?",
        "include phrases such as ?re- newable energy?, ?eco-friendly?, and ?efficient lightbulbs?).",
        "To preserve these relationships as phrases are formed in our sentences, we initialize our left and right composition matrices such that parent vector p is computed by taking the average of children a and b (W L = W R = 0.5I d?d ).",
        "This initialization of the composition matrices has previously been effective for parsing (Socher et al., 2013a).",
        "3 Datasets We performed initial experiments on a dataset of Congressional debates that has annotations on the author level for partisanship, not ideology.",
        "While the two terms are highly correlated (e.g., a member of the Republican party likely agrees with conservative stances on most issues), they are not identical.",
        "For example, a moderate Republican might agree with the liberal position on increased gun control but take conservative positions on other issues.",
        "To avoid conflating partisanship and ideology we create a new dataset annotated for ideological bias on the sentence and phrase level.",
        "In this section we describe our initial dataset (Convote) and explain the procedure we followed for creating our new dataset (IBC).",
        "1 3.1 Convote The Convote dataset (Thomas et al., 2006) consists of US Congressional floor debate transcripts from 2005 in which all speakers have been labeled with their political party (Democrat, Republican, or independent).",
        "We propagate party labels down from the speaker to all of their individual sentences and map from party label to ideology label (Demo- crat?",
        "liberal, Republican?",
        "conservative).",
        "This is an expedient choice; in future work we plan to make use of work in political science characterizing candidates?",
        "ideological positions empirically based on their behavior (Carroll et al., 2009).",
        "While the Convote dataset has seen widespread use for document-level political classification, we are unaware of similar efforts at the sentence level.",
        "3.1.1 Biased Sentence Selection The strong correlation between US political parties and political ideologies (Democrats with liberal, Republicans with conservative) lends confidence that this dataset contains a rich mix of ideological 1 Available at http://cs.umd.edu/ ?",
        "miyyer/ibc 1115 statements.",
        "However, the raw Convote dataset contains a low percentage of sentences with explicit ideological bias.",
        "2 We therefore use the features in Yano et al. (2010), which correlate with political bias, to select sentences to annotate that have a higher likelihood of containing bias.",
        "Their features come from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2001), as well as from lists of ?sticky bigrams?",
        "(Brown et al., 1992) strongly associated with one party or another (e.g., ?illegal aliens?",
        "implies conservative, ?universal healthcare?",
        "implies liberal).",
        "We first extract the subset of sentences that contains any words in the LIWC categories of Negative Emotion, Positive Emotion, Causation, Anger, and Kill verbs.",
        "3 After computing a list of the top 100 sticky bigrams for each category, ranked by log-likelihood ratio, and selecting another subset from the original data that included only sentences containing at least one sticky bigram, we take the union of the two subsets.",
        "Finally, we balance the resulting dataset so that it contains an equal number of sentences from Democrats and Republicans, leaving us with a total of 7,816 sentences.",
        "3.2 Ideological Books In addition to Convote, we use the Ideological Books Corpus (IBC) developed by Gross et al. (2013).",
        "This is a collection of books and magazine articles written between 2008 and 2012 by authors with well-known political leanings.",
        "Each document in the IBC has been manually labeled with coarse-grained ideologies (right, left, and center) as well as fine-grained ideologies (e.g., religious-right, libertarian-right) by political science experts.",
        "There are over a million sentences in the IBC, most of which have no noticeable political bias.",
        "Therefore we use the filtering procedure outlined in Section 3.1.1 to obtain a subset of 55,932 sentences.",
        "Compared to our final Convote dataset, an even larger percentage of the IBC sentences exhibit no noticeable political bias.",
        "4 Because our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative 2 Many sentences in Convote are variations on ?I think this is a good/bad bill?, and there is also substantial parliamentary boilerplate language.",
        "3 While Kill verbs are not a category in LIWC, Yano et al. (2010) adopted it from Greene and Resnik (2009) and showed it to be a useful predictor of political bias.",
        "It includes words such as ?slaughter?",
        "and ?starve?.",
        "4 This difference can be mainly attributed to a historical topics in the IBC (e.g., the Crusades, American Civil War).",

        "bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as ?neutral?",
        "or ?biased?, we filter the dataset further using DUALIST (Settles, 2011), an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences in our dataset.",
        "To train the DUALIST classifier, we manually assigned class labels of ?neutral?",
        "or ?biased?",
        "to 200 sentences, and selected typical partisan unigrams to represent the ?biased?",
        "class.",
        "DUALIST labels 11,555 sentences as politically biased, 5,434 of which come from conservative authors and 6,121 of which come from liberal authors.",
        "3.2.1 Annotating the IBC For purposes of annotation, we define the task of political ideology detection as identifying, if pos-sible, the political position of a given sentence's author, where position is either liberal or conservative.",
        "5 We used the Crowdflower crowdsourcing platform (crowdflower.com), which has previously been used for subsentential sentiment annotation (Sayeed et al., 2012), to obtain human annotations of the filtered IBC dataset for political bias on both the sentence and phrase level.",
        "While members of the Crowdflower workforce are certainly not experts in political science, our simple task and the ubiquity of political bias allows us to acquire useful annotations.",
        "Crowdflower Task First, we parse the filtered IBC sentences using the Stanford constituency parser (Socher et al., 2013a).",
        "Because of the expense of labeling every node in a sentence, we only label one path in each sentence.",
        "The process for selecting paths is as follows: first, if any paths contain one of the top-ten partisan unigrams, 6 we select the longest such path; otherwise, we select the path with the most open class constituencies (NP, VP, ADJP).",
        "The root node of a sentence is always included in a path.",
        "Our task is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Open class constituencies are revealed to the worker incrementally, starting with the NP, VP, or ADJP furthest from the root and progressing up the tree.",
        "We choose this design to prevent workers from changing their lower-level phrase annotations after reading the full sentence.",

        "Workers must correctly annotate at least six of eight gold paths before they are granted access to the full task.",
        "In addition, workers must maintain 75% accuracy on gold paths that randomly appear alongside normal paths.",
        "Gold paths dramatically improve the quality of our workforce: 60% of contributors passed the initial quiz (the 40% that failed were barred from working on the task), while only 10% of workers who passed the quiz were kicked out for mislabeling subsequent gold paths.",

        "Experimental Results Table 1 shows the RNN models outperforming the bag-of-words baselines as well as the word2vec baseline on both datasets.",
        "The increased accuracy suggests that the trained RNNs are capable of detecting bias polarity switches at higher levels in parse trees.",
        "While phrase-level annotations do not improve baseline performance, the RNN model significantly benefits from these annotations because the phrases are themselves derived from nodes in the network structure.",
        "In particular, the phrase annotations allow our best model to detect bias accurately in complex sentences that the baseline models cannot handle.",
        "Initializing the RNN W e matrix with word2vec embeddings improves accuracy over randomly initialization by 1%.",

        "We obtain better results on Convote than on IBC with both bag-of-words and RNN models.",
        "This result was unexpected since the Convote labels are noisier than the annotated IBC labels; however, there are three possible explanations for the discrepancy.",
        "First, Convote has twice as many sentences as IBC, and the extra training data might help the model more than IBC's better-quality labels.",
        "Sec-ond, since the sentences in Convote were originally spoken, they are almost half as short (21.3 words per sentence) as those in the IBC (42.2 words per sentence).",
        "Finally, some information is lost at every propagation step, so RNNs are able to model the shorter sentences in Convote more effectively than the longer IBC sentences.",

        "Figure 5B shows an example of a bias polarity switch in the opposite direction: the sentence negatively portrays supporters of nationalized health care, which our model picks up on.",

        "However, our model is unable to detect the polarity switch when this phrase is negated with ?should not?.",

        "While acquiring data with obscure political biases from the IBC or Convote is unfeasible, we can apply a similar analysis to social media (e.g., Twitter or Facebook updates) to discover how many different ideologies propagate in these networks.",
        "Another direction is to implement more sophisticated RNN models (along with more training data) for bias detection.",
        "We attempted to apply syntactically-untied RNNs (Socher et al., 2013a) to our data with the idea that associating separate matrices for phrasal categories would improve representations at high-level nodes.",
