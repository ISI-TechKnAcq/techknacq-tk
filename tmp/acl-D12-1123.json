        "With the rapid development of e-commerce, most customers express their opinions on various kinds of entities, such as products and services.",
        "These reviews not only provide customers with useful information for reference, but also are valuable for merchants to get the feedback from customers and enhance the qualities of their products or services.",
        "Therefore, mining opinions from these vast amounts of reviews becomes urgent, and has attracted a lot of attentions from many researchers.",
        "In opinion mining, one fundamental problem is opinion target extraction.",
        "This task is to extract items which opinions are expressed on.",
        "In reviews, opinion targets are usually nouns/noun phrases.",
        "For example, in the sentence of ?The phone has a colorful and even amazing screen?, ?screen?",
        "is an opinion target.",
        "In online product reviews, opinion targets often are products or product features, so this task is also named as product feature extraction in previous work (Hu et al. 2004; Ding et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2005; Popescu et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005; Suet al 2008).",
        "To extract opinion targets, many studies regarded opinion words as strong indicators (Hu et al., 2004; Popescu et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2005; Qiu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2010), which is based on the observation that opinion words are usually located around opinion targets, and there are associations between them.",
        "Therefore, most pervious methods iteratively extracted opinion targets depending upon the associations between opinion words and opinion targets (Qiu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2010).",
        "For example, ?colorful?",
        "and ?amazing?",
        "is usually used to modify ?screen?",
        "in reviews about cell phone, so there are strong associations between them.",
        "If ?colorful?",
        "and ?amazing?",
        "had been known to be opinion words, ?screen?",
        "is likely to be an opinion target in this domain.",
        "In addition, the extracted opinion targets can be used to expand more opinion words according to their associations.",
        "It's a mutual reinforcement procedure.",
        "Therefore, mining associations between opinion targets and opinion words is a key for opinion",
        "target extraction (Wu et al. 2009).",
        "To this end, most previous methods (Hu et al. 2004; Ding et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2008), named as adjacent methods, employed the adjacent rule, where an opinion target was regarded to have opinion relations with the surrounding opinion words in a given window.",
        "However, because of the limitation of window size, opinion relations cannot be captured precisely, especially for long-span relations, which would hurt estimating associations between opinion targets and opinion words.",
        "To resolve this problem, several studies exploited syntactic information such as dependency trees (Popescu et al. 2005; Qiu et al. 2009; Qiu et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010).",
        "If the syntactic relation between an opinion word and an opinion target satisfied a designed pattern, then there was an opinion relation between them.",
        "Experiments consistently reported that syntax-based methods could yield better performance than adjacent methods for small or medium corpora (Zhang et al. 2010).",
        "The performance of syntax-based methods heavily depends on the parsing performance.",
        "However, online reviews are often informal texts (including grammar mistakes, typos, improper punctuations etc.).",
        "As a result, parsing may generate many mistakes.",
        "Thus, for large corpora from Web including a great deal of informal texts, these syntax-based methods may suffer from parsing errors and introduce many noises.",
        "Furthermore, this problem maybe more serious on non-English language reviews, such as Chinese reviews, because that the performances of parsing on these languages are often worse than that on English.",
        "To overcome the weakness of the two kinds of methods mentioned above, we propose a novel unsupervised approach to extract opinion targets by using word-based translation model (WTM).",
        "We formulate identifying opinion relations between opinion targets and opinion words as a word alignment task.",
        "We argue that an opinion target can find its corresponding modifier through monolingual word alignment.",
        "For example in Figure 1, the opinion words ?colorful?",
        "and ?amazing?",
        "are aligned with the target ?screen?",
        "through word alignment.",
        "To this end, we use WTM to perform monolingual word alignment for mining associations between opinion targets and opinion words.",
        "In this process, several factors, such as word co-occurrence frequencies, word positions etc., can be considered globally.",
        "Compared with adjacent methods, WTM doesn't identify opinion relations between words in a given window, so long-span relations can be effectively captured (Liu et al. 2009).",
        "Compared with syntax-based methods, without using parsing, WTM can effectively avoid errors from parsing informal texts.",
        "So it will be more robust.",
        "In addition, by using WTM, our method can capture the ?one-to-many?",
        "or ?many-to-one?",
        "relations (?one-to-many?",
        "means that, in a sentence one opinion word modifies several opinion targets, and ?many-to-one?",
        "means several opinion words modify one opinion target).",
        "Thus, it's reasonable to expect that WTM is likely to yield better performance than traditional methods for mining associations between opinion targets and opinion words.",
        "Based on the mined associations, we extract opinion targets in a ranking framework.",
        "All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates.",
        "Then a graph-based algorithm is exploited to assign confidences to each candidate, in which candidate opinion relevance and importance are incorporated to generate a global measure.",
        "At last, the candidates with higher ranks are extracted as opinion targets.",
        "Compared with most traditional methods (Hu et al2004; Liu et al. 2005; Qiu et al. 2011), we don't extract opinion targets iteratively based on the bootstrapping strategy, such as Double Propagation (Qiu et al. 2011), instead all candidates are dynamically ranked in a global process.",
        "Therefore, error propagation can be effectively avoided and the",
        "opinion relation identification The main contributions of this paper are as follows.",
        "1) We formulate the opinion relation identification between opinion targets and opinion words as a word alignment task.",

        "Translation The phone has a colorful and even amazing screen The phone has a colorful and even amazing screen",
        "2) We propose a graph-based algorithm for opinion target extraction in which candidate opinion relevance and importance are incorporated into a unified graph to estimate candidate confidence.",

        "In general, the existing approaches can be divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised methods.",
        "In supervised approaches, the opinion target extraction task was usually regarded as a sequence labeling task (Jin et al2009; Li et al2010; Wu et al., 2009; Ma et al2010; Zhang et al. 2009).",

        "Li et al(2010) proposed a Skip-Tree CRF model for opinion target extraction.",
        "Their methods exploited three structures including linear-chain structure, syntactic structure, and conjunction structure.",
        "In addition, Wu et al(2009) utilized a SVM classifier to identify relations between opinion targets and opinion expressions by leveraging phrase dependency parsing.",
        "The main limitation of these supervised methods is that labeling training data for each domain is impracticable because of the diversity of the review domains.",
        "In unsupervised methods, most approaches regarded opinion words as the important indicators for opinion targets (Hu et al. 2004; Popsecu et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2008; Qiu et al. 2011; Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "The basic idea was that reviewers often use the same opinion words when they comment on the similar opinion targets.",
        "The extraction procedure was often a bootstrapping process which extracted opinion words and opinion targets iteratively, depending upon their associations.",
        "Popsecu et al(2005) used syntactic patterns to extract opinion target candidates.",
        "After that they computed the point-wise mutual information (PMI) score between a candidate and a product category to refine the extracted results.",
        "Hu et al(2004) exploited an association rule mining algorithm and frequency information to extract frequent explicit product features.",
        "The adjective nearest to the frequent explicit feature was extracted as an opinion word.",
        "Then the extracted opinion words were used to extract infrequent opinion targets.",
        "Wang et al(2008) adopted the similar idea, but their method needed a few seeds to weakly supervise the extraction process.",
        "Qiu et al(2009, 2011) proposed a Double Propagation method to expand a domain sentiment lexicon and an opinion target set iteratively.",
        "They exploited direct dependency relations between words to extract opinion targets and opinion words iteratively.",
        "The main limitation of Qiu's method is that the patterns based on dependency parsing tree may introduce many noises for the large corpora (Zhang et al. 2010).",
        "Meanwhile, Double Propagation is a bootstrapping strategy which is a greedy process and has the problem of error propagation.",
        "Zhang et al.",
        "(2010) extended Qiu's method.",
        "Besides the patterns used in Qiu's method, they adopted some other patterns, such as phrase patterns, sentence patterns and ?no?",

        "In addition they used the HITS (Klernberg et al. 1999) algorithm to compute the feature relevance scores, which were simply multiplied by the log of feature frequencies to rank the extracted opinion targets.",

        "2) The graph-based methods (Ours and Zhang) outperform the methods using Double Propagation (DP).",
        "Similar observations have been made by Zhang et al(2010).",
        "The reason is that graph-based methods extract opinion targets in a global framework and they can effectively avoid the error propagation made by traditional methods based on Double Propagation.",
        "Moreover, Ours outperforms Zhang.",
        "We believe the reason is that Ours consider the opinion relevance and the candidate importance in a unified graph-based framework.",

        "3) In Table 4, the improvement made by Ours on Restaurant (Chinese reviews) is larger than that on Hotel and MP3 (English reviews).",
        "The same phenomenon can be found when we compare the improvement made by Ours in Table 3 (Chinese reviews) with that in Table 5 (English reviews).",
        "We believe that reason is that syntactic patterns used in DP and Zhang were exploited based on English grammar, which may not be suitable to Chinese language.",
        "Moreover, another reason is that the performance of parsing on Chinese texts is not better than that on English texts, which will hurt the performance of syntax-based methods (DP and Zhang).",
        "4) Compared the results in Table 3 with the results in Table 4, we can observe that Ours obtains larger improvements with the increase of the data size.",
        "This indicates that our method is more effective for opinion target extraction than state-of-art methods, especially for large corpora.",
        "When the data size increase, the methods based on syntactic patterns will introduce more noises due to the parsing errors on informal texts.",
        "On the other side, Ours uses WTM other than parsing to identify opinion relations between words, and the noises made by inaccurate parsing can be avoided.",
        "Thus, Ours can outperform baselines.",
        "5) In Table 5, Ours makes comparable results with baselines in Customer Review Datasets, although there is a little loss in precision in some domains.",
        "We believe the reason is that the size of Customer Review Datasets is too small.",
