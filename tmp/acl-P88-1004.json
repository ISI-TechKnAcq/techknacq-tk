        "Relational nouns are usually viewed as either requiring non-compositional semantic interpretation, or causing an undesirable proliferation of syntactic rules.",
        "In contrast to this, we present a treatment which is both syntactically uniform and semantically compositional.",

        "The paper shows how this approach handles a variety of linguistic constructions involving relational nouns.",

        "In this respect, they are more reminiscent of verbs than of standard nouns like \"boy\" or \"chair\".",
        "Most verbs of English have one or more argument places that must be filled for the verb to be used in a syntactically/semantically felicitous way; this property of verbs is probably an important reason for the persisting tendency to analyze them as n-place predicates rather than sets of situations.",
        "The semantic similarity between relational nouns and verbs has given rise to treatments which model the syntactic treatment of nouns on the treatment of verbs: one introduces lexical subcategories for nouns which indicate how many arguments they take and how these arguments are marked; the syntactic rules combine N-bars or noun-phrases with genitive phrases and preposition-phrases, taking these subcategorizations into account.",
        "[15] We will now argue, however, that from a syntactic point of view such a move is unattractive.",
        "Syntactically, relational nouns do not behave very differently from \"ordinary\" nouns.",

        "Also, no nouns have syntactic properties that would be analogous to the sentence-level phenomenon of a verb obligatorily taking one or more arguments.",
        "The overt realization of the arguments of a \"transitive noun\" is always optional.",
        "Finally, we may note that relational nouns can be connected to their arguments/values by a variety of verbs and prepositions, which constitute a semantic complex that is also used, with exactly the same structure but with a different meaning, to operate on non-relational nouns.",

        "To summarize: relational nouns do not distinguish themselves syntactically from other nouns, and they mark their function-argument structures by means of polysemous descriptive terms.",
        "We therefore conclude that it would be theoretically elegant as well as computationally effective to treat relational and non-relational nouns identically at the syntactic level, and to account for the semantics of relational noun constructions by exploiting independently motivated disambiguation mechanisms.",
