        "UKB is a knowledge-based unsupervised WSD system which exploits the structure of an underlying Language Knowledge Base (LKB) and finds the most relevant concepts given an input context (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "UKB starts by taking the LKB as a graph of concepts G = (V,E) with a set of vertices V derived from LKB concepts and a set of edges E representing relations among them.",
        "Giving an input context, UKB applies the so called Personalized PageRank (Haveli-wala, 2002) over it to obtain the most representative senses for the context.",
        "PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is a method for scoring the vertices V of a graph according to each node's structural importance.",
        "The algorithm can be viewed as random walk process that postulate the existence of a particle that randomly traverses the graph, but at any time may jump to a new vertex with a given damping factor (also called teleport probability).",
        "After PageRank calculation, the final weight of node i represents the proportion of time that a random particle spends visiting node i after a sufficiently long time.",
        "In standard PageRank, the teleport vector is chosen uniformly, whereas for Personalized PageRank it is chosen from a nonuniform distribution of nodes, specified by a teleport vector.",
        "UKB concentrates the initial probability mass of the teleport vector in the words occurring in the context of the target word, causing all random jumps on the walk to return to these words and thus assigning a higher rank to the senses linked to these words.",
        "Moreover, the high rank of the words spreads through the links in the graph and make all the nodes in its vicinity also receive high ranks.",
        "Given a target word, the system checks which is the relative ranking of its senses, and the WSD system would output the one ranking highest.",
        "UKB is very flexible and can be use to perform WSD on different settings, depending on the context used for disambiguating a word instance.",
        "In this paper we use it to perform general and domain specific WSD, as shown in section 3.",
        "PageRank is calculated by applying an iterative algorithm until convergence below a given threshold is achieved.",
        "Following usual practice, we used a damping value of 0.85 and set the threshold value at 0.001.",
        "We did not optimize these parameters.",
        "Tybots (Term Yielding Robots) are text mining software that mine domain terms from corpus (e.g. web pages), organizing them in a hierarchical structure, connecting them to wordnets and ontologies to create a semantic model for the domain (Bosma and Vossen, 2010).",
        "The software is freely available using Subversion .",
        "Tybots try to establish a view on the terminology of the domain which is as complete as possible, discovering relations between terms and ranking terms by domain relevance.",
        "Preceding term extraction, we perform tok-enization, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatiza-tion, which is stored in Kyoto Annotation Format (KAF) (Bosma et al., 2009).",
        "Tybots work through KAF documents, acquire domain relevant terms based on the syntactic features, gather cooccurrence statistics to decide which terms are significant in the domain and produce a thesaurus with sets of related words.",

        "On a second step each target word is disambiguated using the N most related words as context (see below).",
