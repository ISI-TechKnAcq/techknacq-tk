        "The processes underlying text understanding involve a variety of complex, multifaceted activities which have not been yet completely understood from the cognitive point of view, and which still lack adequate computational models.",
        "Recent research trends in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, however, have put forward some ideas concerning human cognition and automatic problem solving that offer promising tools for the design of text understanding systems.",
        "One of the key ideas emerged in the field of cognitive study of natural language comprehension is that text understanding constitutes in humans an interactive process, where bottom-up, data-driven activities combine with top-down, expectation-driven ones to cooperatively determine the most likely interpretation of the input (Lesgold and Perfetti, 1981).",
        "Roughly speaking, humans begin with a set of expectations about what information is likely to be found in the text.",
        "These expectations are based both on linguistic knowledge (about words, phrases, sentences, and larger pieces of discourse) and on non-linguistic world knowledge.",
        "As information from the text becomes available, the reader strengthens those hypotheses that are consistent with the input and weakens those that are inconsistent.",
        "The stronger hypotheses, in turn, make even more specific predictions about the information represented in the text, so as the initial expectations are successively corrected and refined until they eventually yield an adequate approximation of the meaning of the text.",
        "In one of the first and more detailed descriptions of interactive processes in text understanding, Rumelhart (1977) has proposed a model comprising several knowledge sources, each one operating independently and in parallel with the others.",
        "These knowledge sources are processors operating at different levels of linguistic representation.",
        "The outputs of each of these knowledge sources are hypotheses or best guesses from the data available at that level.",
        "The hypotheses are transferred to a central device, called the message center, where they can be observed by all other knowledge sources, thus being available as evidence for or against hypotheses at other levels.",
        "In a more dynamic view of interaction, Levy (1981) suggests that the message center could modify the activity of each individual processor.",
        "That is, when a particular hypothesis has strong outside support, the analyzers of a particular knowledge source may change their own processing either to seek confirming evidence for it or to accept that view and therefore stop analyzing information that would otherwise have been tested.",
        "The idea of decomposing a difficult problem into a large number of functionally distinct subproblems, each one being tackled by a specialized problem solver, has been pursued with great interest in the last years also in the field of artificial intelligence, where the area of distributed problem solving has developed into a much researched and hot topic.",
        "Several computational paradigms have been proposed, such as blackboard systems (for a review, see: Nii, 1986a; 1986b), contract net (Davis and Smith, 1983), the scientific community metaphor (Komfeld and Hewitt, 1981), FA/C systems (Lesser and GorkiII, 1981) which proved appropriate to several tasks and application domains.",
        "As far as the field of text understanding is concerned, we mention here the work of Cullingford (1981) on DSAM, the distributed script applier, in which an arbitrary number of distinct, potentially distributed, processors are used to read and summarize newspaper stories.",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to the problem of text understanding through a distributed processing paradigm, where different knowledge sources come into play and cooperate in the course of comprehension.",
        "In section two we deal with the rationale of advocating such an approach and the advantages (and disadvantages) in following it.",
        "Section three illustrates the general architecture of a prototype distributed parser, and describes the mechanisms of coordination and communication among the various knowledge sources.",
        "In section four we present an example of the parser operation through the tracing of the analysis of a sample sentence.",
        "Finally, section five deals with the current state of the implementation and highlights the novelty and originality of the approach."

        "Several reasons recommend and support the choice of a distributed approach to text understanding.",
        "From a cognitive point of view, it is indubitable that humans perform such an activity incrementally.",
        "That is, not all what can be derived from a text becomes evident since the very beginning.",
        "Some features of the text are understood almost automatically and with minimum effort, others require more labor, whereas still others become clear only after a thoughtful process.",
        "This increasing depth of processing, which has differential effects about what is understood from the same piece of text",
        "should be modeled also in an automatic system.",
        "A distributed architecture comprising a collection of specialized problem solvers (specialists) with different skill and competence, and working with different knowledge sources, seems a promising way to achieve incrementality.",
        "Such an architecture offers several advantages from a technical point of view, too.",
        "About these we mention: - the possibility to adopt different techniques and methodologies for each specialist, - the fact that specialists can be developed in isolation independently from each other; - the possibility to change one or more specialists without implying a global restructuring of the whole system, - the robustness that can be achieved by overlapping the capabilities of different specialists.",
        "- the facility in designing and debugging, The main problem in adopting a distributed approach is that of control, i.e. making the specialists cooperate.",
        "As Cullingford (1981: 52) puts it, \"...",
        "In an ideal system each expert would become available only when needed, run only so long as it had something useful to do and communicate its findings to interested parties in an efficient manner.",
        "If an appropriate level of integration could be achieved, one could hope to improve the capabilities of an understanding system by adding new knowledge sources, to reuse experts in different problem domains and to investigate the relative performance degradation due to removing various knowledge sources.\".",
        "In our approach we adopt a form of control based on the interaction of each individual specialist with a central manager, which supervises and directs the overall operation of the system by coordinating the autonomous activities of the specialists (bottom-up approach), and by exploiting its own general problem solving strategies (top-down approach).",
        "The prototype distributed parser which has been developed according to the ideas outlined above works in the domain of descriptive text understanding, more precisely computer science literature on operating systems.",
        "It receives in input a natural language text and produces in output a semantic representation of its meaning in the BLR/ELR representation language (Rim, Guida, and Tasso, 1984).",
        "Three main objectivers have been taken into account in the design of the parser: Incrementality of parsing and generation of the BLR/ELR.",
        "As the parser has to cover a large variety of linguistic features and must rely upon a number of different knowledge sources, it seems appropriate that both analysis of the input text and generation of the BLR/ELR representation are carried out in a stepwise manner through successive additions and refinements.",
        "Also the structure itself of the BLR/ELR formalism, made up of a collection of propositions appropriately connected together and supplemented with additional information (e.g., about time, quantification, etc.",
        "), strongly suggests an incremental approach to parsing.",
        "Cognitive validity.",
        "The parser should not only produce a correct BLR/ELR representation of the input text, but it should also show some degree of linguistic competence in the way it operates internally.",
        "In other words, It should provide an acceptable approximation of the basic mental processes that occur in humans.",
        "Effectiveness.",
        "The parser should be capable of operating in an efficient and correct way in non-trivial cases.",
        "Moreover, the parser should be easy to design and debug."

        "As mentioned above, our distributed parser Is constituted by a collection of individual specialists, each one expert in a facet of the parsing problem (e.g., syntactic analysis, disambiguation, reference, semantics, time, quantification, BLR/ELR construction, etc.).",
        "Each specialist is an autonomous problem solver, which has its own competence domain, where it can operate with certain and complete knowledge.",
        "However, it Is assumed that no specialist has enough knowledge and competence to cover the whole parsing activity: all (or most) of them are necessary to successfully complete the parsing of a complex text.",
        "Moreover, we assume that specialists may be heterogeneous, i.e., implemented using different technologies (e.g., a deterministic algorithm, a knowledge-based system, etc.).",
        "Also, they may have partially overlapping competence areas, and even be redundant, i.e. there may be several specialists for the same task (e.g., for syntactic analysis).",
        "As we have stated that specialists are independent problem solvers, we also assume that they have no mutual knowledge: they do not know about each other, they do not even know about the existence of other specialists.",
        "This assumption is very important to allow a fully independent design of an individual specialist, without bothering about the others.",
        "Each specialist can solve a well defined class of problems, and once a problem has been assigned to it, it can result in three different outcomes: - success, i.e. the problem assigned has been solved and its solution produced; - fail, i.e. the specialist has been unable to solve the problem and an alarm message is returned; need-help, i.e. the specialist has been successful in decomposing and partially solving the problem at hand, but it needs help from outside to proceed further in the solution process.",
        "In this case, the current problem is suspended, and (sub)problems are generated for which solutions are needed.",
        "The internal operation of each specialist is not of interest here, as we have assumed that they may be heterogeneous.",
        "What is crucial is the interface they show towards the outside which is expected to be very simple.",
        "A specialist may receive a problem to solve, and issue a solution, other problems, or an alarm.",

        "The communication between specialists and the cooperation manager occurs according to a fixed protocol which includes three basic types of messages, namely: problems, solutions, and alarms, as already outlined above.",
        "The working memory of the parser is a partitioned shared memory, where each specialist can read and write in its own partition only, but has full visibility on the entire memory.",
        "Clearly, in order to allow specialists to work correctly on the shared memory, it is necessary that a common representation language is adopted, at least for information that may concern more than one specialist.",
        "The operation of the cooperation manager is basically message-driven: it is all the time waiting for messages and, as soon as messages arrive from the specialists, they are stored in a buffer and later examined and treated according to some specific policy (e.g., the priority of the messages or their origin may be taken into account).",
        "The cooperation manager is in charge of three main activities: - it assigns problems to specialists according to their competence, current work load, etc.",
        "; - it passes solutions to the relevant specialists (i.e., those who issued the (sub)problem to which the solution refers); - it manages alarms (e.g., by resorting to alternative specialists with similar or overlapping competence).",
        "The cooperation manager, however, in addition to the above mentioned message handling capability, has also its own strategies that can override, when needed, the basic message-driven style, thus affecting the overall operation of the parser.",
        "These strategies, that embed knowledge about \"how to manage the parsing task\", are crucial to the successful activity of the parser if we really want to allow individual specialists to be designed and constructed independently from each other.",
        "In fact, as no global strategy is coded in the system, it must be explicitly assigned as an additional competence to the cooperation manager."

        "In this section we will shortly illustrate some of the most significant characteristics of the parsing process by means of the analysis of a simple sentence extracted from a text on operating systems.",
        "Let us consider the following fragment of text: \"... An integer priority is assigned by the scheduler to each process in the ready-queue....\" The Cooperation Manager, hereinafter CM, is devoted to organize the work of the specialists which are able to solve specific parts of the overall problem.",
        "In the current version, the CM largely relies on the BEGS specialist for structuring the parsing process and for generating the BLR/ELR: each sentence in the text is processed one after the other, from left to right.",

        "Moreover, we will not describe how the management of the shared memory and its partitions is actually carried on.",

        "In this example, a semantics-directed parsing will be shown.",
        "More specifically, when the sample sentence shown above is considered, the CM will assign the problem of semantically analyzing the sentence to all the specialists potentially capable to perform such an analysis (in the current version, SES and SSS).",
        "At the same time, it will assign to OS, RS, and TS the quantification, reference, and temporal analysis task, respectively.",
        "Appropriate problem messages will be sent to each of them, such for example: To: SES From: CM Problem: Semantic Analysis On: < ... the current sentence ... > Priority: Auxiliary.",
        "Also the message requesting semantic analysis from SSS will have an Auxiliary priority since for the same problem more than one specialist is engaged and can possibly find a correct answer.",
        "When, later on, one of them will possibly recognize its inability to correctly complete the task, it will send back to the CM a message containing an alarm, causing in such a way a change in the priority of the semantic analysis problem, that will become Fatal.",
        "The other three messages sent by the CM to RS, OS, and TS will have a Fatal priority, because no alternative specialists are able to contribute to the solution of that part of the overall problem.",
        "After these initial problem assignments, the CM enters a suspended state, which will be resumed whenever messages from any of the specialists will be received.",
        "RS, OS, and TS can generally carry on their activity only after some semantic information about the sentence has been provided.",
        "To this purpose, all these three specialists will send to the CM a message of the kind",
        "The use of a Fatal priority will cause a synchronization of the three specialists with the completion of semantic analysis, since their activity will be suspended as long as they will not receive back from the CM a solution message containing an answer to this problem.",
        "In this case, CM has already sent appropriate requests conceming the semantic analysis, and therefore all the activities will remain suspended until completion of the task.",
