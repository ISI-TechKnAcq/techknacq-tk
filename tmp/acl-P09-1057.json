        "We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo (1994), in which we are given a raw word sequence and a dictionary of legal tags for each word type.",
        "The goal is to tag each word token so as to maximize accuracy against a gold tag sequence.",
        "Whether this is a realistic problem set-up is arguable, but an interesting collection of methods and results has accumulated around it, and these can be clearly compared with one another.",
        "We use the standard test set for this task, a 24,115-word subset of the Penn Treebank, for which a gold tag sequence is available.",

        "Per-token ambiguity is about 1.5 tags/token, yielding approximately 10 possible ways to tag the data.",
        "There are 45 distinct grammatical tags.",
        "In this set-up, there are no unknown words.",
