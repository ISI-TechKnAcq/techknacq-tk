        "The PCA can quantify both the term frequency and term-term relationship in the document by the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs.",
        "And the sentence-term matrix can be decomposed into the proper dimensional sentence-concentrated and term-concentrated marices which are used for the Euclidean distances between the sentence and term vectors and also removed the noise of variability in term usage by the SVD.",

        "Automatic text summarization is the process of reducing the length of text documents, while retaining the essential qualities of the orginal.",
        "Many search engines have tried to solve the problem of information overflowing by showing either the title and beginning of of a document.",
        "However, such the title and beginning are insufficient to decide the relevance of the documents which user wants to search, and this is the reason that the text summarization is required to resolve this problem.",
        "The process of text summarization could consist of two phases: a document interpretation phase and a summary generation phase.",
        "The primary goal of a document interpretation phase is to find the main theme of a document and its corresponding significant words.",
        "Since the significant words collectively represent the main theme of a document, it is important to find them more reasonably.",
        "For the purpose of this doing , the word frequency of a document might be utilized[4,8].",
        "But this approach is limited in that cooccurrence relationships among words are not considered at all.",
        "In contrast to word frequency, the other method by using WordNet or a thesaurus[2] makes good use of word relationships such as NT(narrow term), RT(related term), and so on.",
        "However such resources require a large cost to compile, and often represent too general relationships to fit a specific domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new summarization approach by both principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) that are called quantification methods or statistical analysis methods.",
        "PCA is utilized to find significant words or terms in the document by term-relationships.",
        "Since the necessary term-relationships can be acquired only from the given document by linear transformation of PCA, the proposed method need not exploit the additional information such as WordNet or a thesaurus.",
        "And the SVD is used to extract the significant sentences.",
        "After performing SVD, a sentence-term matrix is decomposed into three matrices; that is, a sentence-concentrated matrix, a term-concentrated matrix, and a singular value matrix.",
        "The distances between significant term vectors and sentence vectors can be calculated by using a sentence-concentrated matrix and a term-concentrated matrix.",
        "The shorter the distance is, the more important the sentence is.",
        "In a word, to produce the summary of a document, we first identify significant terms by the term-term relationships of being generated by PCA, and second extract the significant sentences by the distances betweeen significant term vectors and all sentence vectors.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 and 3 describe the way to identify the significant terms by PCA, and extract the significant sentences by SVD, respectively.",
        "Section 4 reports experimental results.",
        "A brief conclusion is given in Section 5.",
        "And this paper enlarges [7] whose main content is to find out the significant terms by PCA.",
        "2 Significant Term Extraction by PCA 2.1 PCA Overview and Its Application",
        "In this subsection, we will outline PCA which is adapted from [6] and which is used to extract the significant terms in the document.",
        "PCA is concerned with explaining the variance-covariance structure through a few linear combinations of the original variables.",
        "Its general objective is data reduction and interpretation.",
        "Algebraically, principal components are particular linear combinations of the p random variables X1,X2, • • • ,Xp.",
        "Geometrically, these linear combinations represent the selection of a new coordinate system obtained by rotating the orginal system with X1,X2,- • • ,Xp as the coordinate axes.",
        "PCA uses the covariance matrix (i.e., term-term correlation or cooccurrence matrix) instead of the obsevation-variable matrix (i.e., sentence-term matrix) such as Table 2.",
        "Let S be the covariance matrix associated with the random vector XT =[X1,X2, • • • ,Xp].",
        "Let S have the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs (A1 ,e1), (A2,e2), (Ap,ep)where A1 > A2 > ...Xp > 0.",
        "The *th principal compo-nent(PC) is given by",
        "The first PC is the linear combination with maximum variance, and has the widest spread in a new coordinate system geometrically.",
        "Consequently, we can say that it can cover the distribution of term frequency of a document as wide as possible, and also say that it has the power of explanation of the distribution as large as possible (but, not considering the meaning).",
        "The PCs are uncorrelated and have variances equal to the eigenvalues of S, and the proportion of total population variance due to the ith PC, pi,is",
        "If most (80 ~ 90%) of the total population variance, for large p, can be attributed to the first one, two, or three components, then these components can \"replace\" the original p variables without much loss of information.",
        "The first i PCs have also maximal mutual information with respect to the inputs among projections onto all possible i directions, and mutual information is given by I(X, Y) = H(X) - H(X\\Y)[5].",
        "As we expected, all terms of the document are not necessary to represent the content (i.e., term frequency distribution) of the document by using a few first i PCs, because they have most of the total population variance and maximal mutual information as noted earlier.",
        "In addition, since PCA exploits a covariance matrix, we can use the term-term relationships by eigenvalues and eigenvectors without additional information resources.",
        "In the next subsection, we will describe how to extract the significant terms by eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs of a few first i PCs.",
        "2.2 Extracting Significant Terms by Eigenvalue-Eigenvector Pairs",
        "We assume that the candidates for the significant terms are confined only to nouns occurred more than 2 times in a document.",
        "We also regard the sentences as observations, the extracted nouns (terms) as variables, and the value of variables as the number of occurrence of terms in each sentence (cf. cumulative frequency of the document in [7] ) .",
        "Table 1 shows the term list extracted from one of the Korean newspaper articles composed of 12 sentences, and all of these terms have the occurrences more than twice in the document.",
        "Since the terms occurred just once are not reasonable to be representative nouns, we do not consider such terms.",
        "In our sample article, 9 terms are extracted for the cadidates for the significant ones as shown in Table 1.",
        "The sample article has 12 sentences (observations) originally, but there",

        "are 9 ones in sentence-term matrix as shown in Table 2.",
        "The only reason for this difference was that the sentences, which did not include the 9 extracted terms at all, were omitted.",
        "In Table 2, the column under the head X1 shows the freqeuncy of X1 ,thatis, X1 occurred once in first sentence, twice in second sentence, once in eighth sentence.",
        "In Table 3, the 9 PCs are obtained after performning PCA with the 9 variables.",
        "The column under the head PC1 shows the eigenvector of the first PC, for instance, P(f1 = (-0.713, -0.417, • • •, 0.025,0.111).",
        "Its eigenvalue is 0.871, and its proportion of total population is 32.34% computed by Eq.",
        "(2).",
        "There are two steps to extract the significant terms by eigenvales and eigenvectors as shown in Table 3.",
        "First we need to decide how many PCs are selected, and second to find out how to express the each selected PC.",
        "In order to select a few most salient PCs, we can make good use of cumulative ratio of eigenvalues.",
        "For example, the first four PCs can justify more than 90% (91.28%) of the total sample variance, we can choose them without much loss information.",
        "In other words, sample variance is summarized very well by these four PCs and the data from 9 observations on 9 variables can be reasonably reduced to 9 observations on 4 PCs.",
        "Until now, we could not know what the selected PCs represent exactly, but we could describe them by their coefficients approximately.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a summarization approach that constructs a summary by extracting sentences in a single document.",
        "The particular techniques used are PCA and SVD for extracting the significant terms and sentences respectively.",
        "PCA can quantify the information on both the term frequency and the term-term cooccurrence in the document by the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs.",
        "These pairs were used to find out the significant terms among the nouns in the document.",
        "In addition, these terms can be regarded as those extracted by relationships between terms in the document, since PCA exploits the variance-covariance structure.",
        "In contrast to PCA, SVD has the inforamtion on the sentences and terms after computing it of sentence-term matrix.",
        "In this regard, we can use the decomposed matrices to calculate the distances between the sentence and term vectors, and to make an effective removal of the noise of variability in term usage.",
        "Experimental results on Korean newspaper articles show that the proposed method is superior to the methods of both random selection and only using PCA, and that extracting sentences by the distances per each term is better performance than extracting by all the distances of all the terms.",
        "In conclusion, the information on the cooccurrence relationships between the terms by the PCA and the vector expressions of the sentences and terms by the SVD can be helpful for the text summarization.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed methods only exploited the pattern of the statistical occurrences within a document without the additional resources like a thesaurus to find out the relationships between the terms, and the proper dimension of the vectors."
