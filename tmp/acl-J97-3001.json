        "A hyphenator program takes as input a word and returns the set of points within the word where hyphens are permissible.",
        "Word hyphenation depends strictly on the target natural language, and many of the problems encountered are language specific.",
        "In general, machine hyphenation can be achieved either by consulting lists of hyphenated words or by developing pattern-based hyphenation programs (Liang 1983; Knuth 1986).",
        "The first approach ensures complete and correct hyphenation, but it has the disadvantage of being incapable of hyphenating words not on the list.",
        "In particular, for highly inflectional languages, such as Greek, these word lists would have to be extremely extensive in order to include all possible inflectional and derivational word forms.",
        "Even if such lists could be generated, it would be impossible to include words such as compounds, which can be readily created, or all proper names.",
        "In addition, the initial step toward the development of lists of hyphenated words is commonly rule-based hyphenation.",
        "On the other hand, although the second approach does not raise such problems, it has the disadvantage of being unable to guarantee complete and accurate hyphenation.",
        "The aim of the present study has been to analytically examine Modern Greek hyphenation in order to develop a pattern-based hyphenator.",
        "The requirement specifications are defined as follows: (i) to strictly prohibit impermissible hyphen generation; (ii) to generate a hyphen list that is as complete as possible.",
        "Existing hyphenator programs meet the first requirement either by decreasing the number of proposed hyphens or by establishing stop lists containing the appropriately hyphenated exceptional words.",
        "Commonly, fulfilling the second requirement depends on the development of extensive subword patterns associated with hyphenation rules, as in Liang 1983, for example.",
        "Establishing lists of exceptions has the same disadvantages as the approach to hyphenating through consulting lists of hyphenated words,",
        "and thus hyphenator dependencies on lists of exceptions must be restricted as much as possible.",
        "Native Greek speakers are able to hyphenate most Greek words fully and unambiguously.",
        "In extreme cases, they will propose two hyphen sets for the same word, one being a proper subset of the other, but both being acceptable.",
        "However, complete automatic hyphenation is a rather complex task.",
        "Although consonant splitting is clearly determined by the grammar rules of Modern Greek and is thus easily expressed in terms of non-exceptional formal patterns associated with specific hyphenation rules, vowel splitting is not.",
        "The main problem of vowel splitting is that the grammar indicates the cases where splitting is not allowed, and the splitting of a large number of these cases is ambiguous.",
        "In addition, Greek vowels are sometimes accented, so ambiguity resolution concerns thousands of vowel sequences.",
        "Existing hyphenator programs for Modern Greek are available as either commercial or research-based products and usually work on a minimal basis, i.e., finding only hyphenation points of consonant sequences.",
        "Some research-based versions, including one application of the TEX (Knuth 1986) hyphenator for Greek, achieve improved hyphenation but cover a minimal subset of the vowel sequences.",
        "The present paper will encapsulate the standard grammar hyphenation rules and the general principles used in this study.",
        "The paper expresses these rules (which focus mainly on consonant sequences) formally and points out their limitations in terms of formal word expressions that can be completely and correctly hyphenated.",
        "The paper then turns to the problem of vowel splitting, and, by formally examining prohibitive grammar rules, deduces general hyphenation rules.",
        "It presents additional heuristic rules discovered during an exhaustive search of ambiguous vowel patterns, and demonstrates the degree of the resolved ambiguity in terms of the number of vowel sequences that have been disambiguated.",
        "Implementation issues are discussed, as well as the problem of words written in uppercase letters.",
        "Finally, the paper outlines the potential for generalization to other languages."

        "To deal with this problem formally we shall determine weaker boundaries of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs.",
        "When considering hyphenation in regard to diphthongs, the problem is that diphthong definitions are circular, as in Triantafillidis (1978, 33), who states that \"two vowels' that",
        "Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek are pronounced together in one syllable constitute a diphthong.\"",
        "The circularity of this definition was observed by Petrounias (1984, 393), who proposes a less risky and more formal definition; namely, \"a diphthong is made up of a semivowel and a vowel.\"",
        "Although the general issue of diphthongs is discussed at length, focusing on the development of ancient diphthongs and on phonetic issues, it is not discussed from a hyphenation perspective.",
        "A more clear approach is proposed by Tsopanakis (1994, 39, 84) who states that Modern Greek diphthongs are made up of a semivowel or /u/ and a vowel or double-vowel blend.' Although linguists do not always agree with the terminology, in order to avoid confusion, the simplified definition shall be used – namely that in diphthongs the semivowel is on the right and in excessive diphthongs, on the left.' Because semivowels are represented by vowel characters or double-vowel blends, the two categories overlap.",
        "In short, diphthong vowel sequences are suffixed with semivowels /i/ or /u/ and excessive diphthongs prefixed by an /i/ or /u/ semivowel.",
        "The semivowel is not automatically identified, thus, practically, we have to deal with a large set of candidate diphthongs and candidate excessive diphthongs.",
        "Formally, these sets are defined as:",
        "where I is the set of all vowels or double-vowel blends that are phonetically equivalent to /i/ and LI is the set of all double-vowel blends that are phonetically equivalent to /u/.1° The complete sets are as follows: I = {71, t, v, 7), 5,1, ol, v 11 and U = {ov,oV}.",
        "Therefore, every sequence of two tokensfifj±i in the k-token sequence fo • • •fk_i, 0 < j < k – 1, that is not a diphthong candidate or excessive diphthong candidate can, by definition, be split.",
        "Hence, formally the points between the tokens fj and fi±i of every sequence f1 such that fil+1 E (V U 2V U VC) x (VU 2V U VC) – (VU 2V) x (I U U) – (I U U) x (V U 2V) are permissible.",

        "To conclude then, vowel splitting may be summarized by the following Lemma:",
        "2.2.1 Diphthong Identification.",
        "In the previous section, vowel splitting was formally examined and concrete hyphenation rules were derived.",
        "However, as Lemma 6(c) explicitly acknowledges, hyphenation is restricted by diphthongs and excessive diphthongs.",
        "In this section, we shall proceed to an empirical examination of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs.",
        "Taking into account the initial specification that the hyphenator should never generate non-acceptable hyphens, and in order to pare down the enormous sets of candidate diphthongs and excessive diphthongs, we need to isolate the subset of sequences for which splitting is always permitted.",
        "The approach followed was to first select all sequences of the above sets that were mentioned in various grammar books as examples of diphthongs and to assign them to the category of \"neversplitting sequences.\"",
        "Then experimental matches were conducted through an electronic dictionary of Modern Greek that encodes 100,000 lemmata and all their inflectional and derivational forms (Vagelatos et al.",
        "1995), and a 13 Mbyte corpus of newspaper articles.",
        "By definition, this process could not be automatic because hyphens were not included in the lexicon or the corpus, but there were far too many matches to be examined manually.",
        "Manual examination was restricted to those matches having limited frequency of occurrence.",
        "Nevertheless, during this process, a systematic method of identifying additional nonsplitting sequences was discovered based on a rule for stressing that states that a stress mark can only be applied to the ultimate, penultimate, or antepenultimate position of a word.",
