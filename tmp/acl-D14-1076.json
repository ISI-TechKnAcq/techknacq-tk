        "Automatic summarization can be broadly divided into two categories: extractive and abstractive summarization.",
        "Extractive summarization focuses on selecting salient sentences from the document collection and concatenating them to form a sum-mary; while abstractive summarization is generally considered more difficult, involving sophisticated techniques for meaning representation, content planning, surface realization, etc.",
        "There has been a surge of interest in recent years on generating compressed document summaries as a viable step towards abstractive summarization.",
        "These compressive summaries often contain more information than sentence-based extractive summaries since they can remove insignificant sentence constituents and make space for more salient information that is otherwise dropped due to the summary length constraint.",
        "Two general strategies have been used for compressive summariza-tion.",
        "One is a pipeline approach, where sentence-based extractive summarization is followed or proceeded by sentence compression (Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007; Vanderwende et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013).",
        "Another line of work uses joint compression and summarization.",
        "Such methods have been shown to achieve promising performance (Daume?, 2006; Chali and Hasan, 2012; Almeida and Mar-tins, 2013; Qian and Liu, 2013), but they are typically computationally expensive.",
        "In this study, we propose an innovative sentence compression model based on expanded constituent parse trees.",
        "Our model uses integer linear programming (ILP) to search the entire space of compression, and is discriminatively trained.",
        "It is built based on the discriminative sentence compression model from (McDonald, 2006) and (Clarke and Lapata, 2008), but our method uses an expanded constituent parse tree rather than only the leaf nodes in previous work.",
        "Therefore we can extract rich features for every node in the constituent parser tree.",
        "This is an advantage of tree-based compression technique (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Wang et al., 2013).",
        "Similar to (Li et al., 2013a), we use a pipeline summarization framework where multiple compression candidates are generated for each pre-selected important sentence, and then an ILP-691 based summarization model is used to select the final compressed sentences.",
        "We evaluate our proposed method on the TAC 2008 and 2011 data sets using the standard ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004) and human evaluation of the linguistic quality.",
        "Our results show that using our proposed sentence compression model in the summarization system can yield significant performance gain in linguistic quality, without losing much performance on the ROUGE metric.",
        "2 Related Work Summarization research has seen great development over the last fifty years (Nenkova and McKe-own, 2011).",
        "Compared to the abstractive counter-part, extractive summarization has received considerable attention due to its clear problem for-mulation: to extract a set of salient and non-redundant sentences from the given document set.",
        "Both unsupervised and supervised approaches have been explored for sentence selection.",
        "Supervised approaches include the Bayesian classifier (Kupiec et al., 1995), maximum entropy (Os- borne, 2002), skip-chain CRF (Galley, 2006), discriminative reranking (Aker et al., 2010), among others.",
        "The extractive summary sentence selection problem can also be formulated in an optimization framework.",
        "Previous methods include using integer linear programming (ILP) and sub-modular functions to solve the optimization problem (Gillick et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013b; Lin and Bilmes, 2010).",
        "Compressive summarization receives increasing attention in recent years, since it offers a viable step towards abstractive summarization.",
        "The compressed summaries can be generated through a joint model of the sentence selection and compression processes, or through a pipeline approach that integrates a sentence compression model with a summary sentence pre-selection or post-selection step.",
        "Many studies have explored the joint sentence compression and selection setting.",
        "Martins and Smith (2009) jointly performed sentence extraction and compression by solving an ILP problem.",
        "Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011) proposed an approach to score the candidate summaries according to a combined linear model of extractive sentence selection and compression.",
        "They trained the model using a margin-based objective whose loss captures the final summary quality.",
        "Woodsend and Lapata (2012) presented another method where the summary's informative-ness, succinctness, and grammaticality are learned separately from data but optimized jointly using an ILP setup.",
        "Yoshikawa et al. (2012) incorporated semantic role information in the ILP model.",
        "Our work is closely related with the pipeline approach, where sentence-based extractive summarization is followed or proceeded by sentence compression.",
        "There have been many studies on sentence compression, independent of the summarization task.",
        "McDonald (2006) firstly introduced a discriminative sentence compression model to directly optimize the quality of the compressed sentences produced.",
        "Clarke and Lapata (2008) improved the above discriminative model by using ILP in decoding, making it convenient to add constraints to preserve grammatical structure.",
        "Nomoto (2007) treated the compression task as a sequence labeling problem and used CRF for it.",
        "Thadani and McKeown (2013) presented an approach for discriminative sentence compression that jointly produces sequential and syntactic representations for output text.",
        "Filippova and Altun (2013) presented a method to automatically build a sentence compression corpus with hundreds of thousands of instances on which deletion-based compression algorithms can be trained.",
        "In addition to the work on sentence compression as a stand-alone task, prior studies have also investigated compression for the summarization task.",
        "Knight and Marcu (2000) utilized the noisy channel and decision tree method to perform sentence compression in the summarization task.",
        "Lin (2003) showed that pure syntactic-based compression may not significantly improve the summarization performance.",
        "Zajic et al. (2007) compared two sentence compression approaches for multi-document summarization, including a ?parse-and- trim?",
        "and a noisy-channel approach.",
        "Galanis and Androutsopoulos (2010) used the maximum entropy model to generate the candidate compressions by removing branches from the source sentences.",
        "Woodsend and Lapata (2010) presented a joint content selection and compression model for single-document summarization.",
        "They operated over a phrase-based representation of the source document which they obtained by merging information from PCFG parse trees and dependency graphs.",
        "Liu and Liu (2013) adopted the CRF-based sentence compression approach for summa-692 rizing spoken documents.",
        "Unlike the word-based operation, some of these models e.g (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Siddharthan et al., 2004; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Galanis and Androutsopou-los, 2010; Wang et al., 2013), are tree-based approaches that operate on the parse trees and thus the compression decision can be made for a con-stituent, instead of a single word.",
        "3 Sentence Compression Method Sentence compression is a task of producing a summary for a single sentence.",
        "The compressed sentence should be shorter, contain important content from the original sentence, and be grammatical.",
        "In some sense, sentence compression can be described as a ?scaled down version of the text summarization problem?",
        "(Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "Here similar to much previous work on sentence compression, we just focus on how to re-move/select words in the original sentence without using operation like rewriting sentence.",
        "3.1 Discriminative Compression Model by ILP McDonald (2006) presented a discriminative compression model, and Clarke and Lapata (2008) improved it by using ILP for decoding.",
        "Since our proposed method is based upon this model, in the following we briefly describe it first.",
        "Details can be found in (Clarke and Lapata, 2008).",
        "In this model, the following score function is used to evaluate each compression candidate: s(x, y) = |y| ?",

        "Note that L(y i ) < L(y i+1 ) is required, that is, each word in x can only occur at most once in compression y.",
        "In this model, a first order Markov assumption is used for the score function.",
        "Decoding this model is to find the combination of bigrams that maximizes the score function in Eq (1).",

        "In the example tree, the solid lines represent relationship of nodes from the original parse tree, the long dot lines denote the extension of the duplication nodes from the upper level to the lower level, and the nodes at the same level are connected (arrowed lines) to represent that is a sequence.",
        "Based on this expanded constituent parse tree, we can consider every level as a ?sentence?",
        "and the tokens are POS tags and parse tree labels.",
        "We apply the above compression model in Section 3.1 on every level to decide every node's status in the final compressed sentence.",
