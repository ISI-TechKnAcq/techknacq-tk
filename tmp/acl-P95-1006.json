        "In a consistent text, many words and phrases are repeatedly used in more than one sentence.",
        "When an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words) is repeated in different sentences, the constituent words of those sentences tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with identical parts of speech and identical modifieemodifier relationships.",
        "Thus, when a syntactic parser cannot parse a sentence as a unified structure, parts of speech and modifiee-modifier relationships among morphologically identical words in complete parses of other sentences within the same text provide useful information for obtaining partial parses of the sentence.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method for completing partial parses by maintaining consistency among morphologically identical words within the same text as regards their part of speech and their modifiee-modifier relationship.",
        "The experimental results obtained by using this method with technical documents offer good prospects for improving the accuracy of sentence analysis in a broad-coverage natural language processing system such as a machine translation system."

      "text": [
        "In order to develop a practical natural language processing (NLP) system, it is essential to deal with ill-formed sentences that cannot be parsed correctly according to the grammar rules in the system.",
        "In this paper, an \"ill-formed sentence\" means one that cannot be parsed as a unified structure.",
        "A syntactic parser with general grammar rules is often unable to analyze not only sentences with grammatical errors and ellipses, but also long sentences, owing to their complexity.",
        "Thus, ill-formed sentences include not only ungrammatical sentences, but also some grammatical sentences that cannot be parsed as unified structures owing to the presence of unknown words or to a lack of completeness in the syntactic parser.",
        "In texts from a restricted domain, such as computer manuals, most sentences are grammatically correct.",
        "However, even a well-established syntactic parser usually fails to generate a unified parsed structure for about 10 to 20 percent of all the sentences in such texts, and the failure to generate a unified parsed structure in syntactic analysis leads to a failure in the output of a NLP system.",
        "Thus, it is indispensable to establish a correct analysis for such a sentence.",
        "To handle such sentences, most previous approaches apply various heuristic rules (Jensen et al., 1992; Douglas and Dale, 1992; Richardson and Braden-Harder, 1988), including",
        "• Relaxing constraints in the condition part of a grammatical rule, such as number and gender constraints • Joining partial parses by using meta rules.",
        "Either way, the output reflects the general plausibility of an analysis that can be obtained from information in the sentence; however, the interpretation of a sentence depends on its discourse, and inconsistency with recovered parses that contain different analyses of the same phrase in other sentences in the discourse often results in odd outputs of the natural language processing system.",
        "Starting from the viewpoint that an interpretation of a sentence must be consistent in its discourse, we worked on completing incomplete parses by using information extracted from complete parses in the discourse.",
        "The results were encouraging.",
        "Since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse, the complete parses of well-formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse.",
        "Thus, rather than trying to enhance a syntactic parser's grammar rules in order to support ill-formed sentences, which seems to be an endless task after the parser has obtained enough coverage to parse general grammatical sentences, we treat the",
        "syntactic parser as a black box and complete incomplete parses, in the form of partially parsed chunks that a bottom-up parser outputs for ill-formed sentences, by using information extracted from the discourse.",
        "In the next section, the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill-formed sentences.",
        "After that, we propose an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using discourse information, and give the results of an experiment on completing incomplete parses in technical documents.",
        "2 Discourse information for completing incomplete parses In this section, we use the word \"discourse\" to denote a set of sentences that forms a text concerning related topics.",
        "Gale (Gale et al., 1992) and Nasukawa (Nasukawa, 1993) reported that polyse-mous words within the same discourse have the same word sense with a high probability (98% according to (Gale et al., 1992),) and the results of our analysis indicate that most content words are frequently repeated in the discourse, as is shown in Table 1; moreover, collocation (modifier-modifiee relationship) patterns are also repeated frequently in the same discourse, as is shown in Figure 1.",
        "This figure reflects the analysis of structurally ambiguous phrases in a computer manual consisting of 791 consecutive sentences for discourse sizes ranging from 10 to 791 sentences.",
        "For each structurally ambiguous phrase, more than one candidate collocation pattern was formed by associating the structurally ambiguous phrase with its candidate modifiees 1, and a collocation pattern identical with or similar to each of these candidate collocation patterns was searched for in the discourse.",
        "An identical collocation pattern is one in which both modifiee and modifier sides consist of words that are morphologically identical with those in the sentence being analyzed, and that stand in an identical relationship.",
        "A similar collocation pattern is one in which either the modifiee or modifier side has a word that is morphologically identical with the corresponding word in the sentence being analyzed, while the other has a synonym.",
        "Again, the relationship of the two sides is identical with that in the sentence being analyzed.",
        "Except in the case where all 791 sentences were referred to as a discourse, the results indicate the averages obtained by referring to each of several sample areas as a discourse.",
        "For example, to obtain data for the case in which the size of a discourse was 20 sentences, we examined 32 areas each consisting of 20 sentences,",
        "the ambiguous phrase, on the desktop, forms two candidate collocation patterns: \"use – (on) – desktop\" and \"folder – (on) – desktop.\"",
        "such as the 1st sentence to the 20th, the 51st to the 70th, and the 701st to the 720th.",
        "Thus, Figure 1 indicates that a collocation pattern either identical with or similar to at least one of the candidate collocation patterns of a structurally ambiguous phrase was found within the discourse in more than 70% of cases, provided the discourse contained more than 300 consecutive sentences.",
        "On the assumption that this feature of words in a discourse provides a clue to improving the accuracy of sentence analysis, we conducted an experiment on sentences for which a syntactic parser generated more than one parse tree, owing to the presence of words that can be assigned to more than one part of speech, or to the presence of complicated coordinate structures, or for various other reasons.",
        "If the constituent words tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with an identical part of speech and identical modifiee-modifier relationship when an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words) is repeated in different sentences within the discourse, the candidate parse that shares the most collocation patterns with other sentences in the discourse should be selected as the correct analysis.",
        "Out of 736 consecutive sentences in a computer manual, the ESG parser (McCord, 1991) generated multiple parses for 150 sentences.",
        "In this experiment, we divided the original 736 sentences into two texts, one a discourse of 400 sentences and the other a discourse of 336 sentences.",
        "Of the 150 sentences with multiple parses, 24 were incorrectly analyzed in all candidate parses or had identical candidate parses; we therefore focused on the other 126 sentences.",
        "In each candidate parse of these sentences, we assigned a score for each collocation that was repeated in other sentences in the discourse (in the form of either an identical collocation or a similar collocation), and added up the collocation scores to assign a preference value to the candidate parse.",
        "Out of the 126 sentences, different preference values were assigned to candidate parses in 54 sentences, and the highest value was assigned to a correct parse in 48 (88.9%) of the 54 sentences.",
        "Thus, there is a strong tendency for identical collocations to be actually repeated in the discourse, and when an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words) is repeated in different sentences, their constituent words tend to be associated in identical modification patterns.",
        "Figure 2 shows the output of the PEG parser (Jensen, 1992) for the following sentence: (2.1) As you can see, you can choose from many topics to find out what information is available about the AS/400 system.",
        "This is the 53rd sentence in Chapter 6 of a computer manual (IBM, 1992), and every word of it is repeatedly used in other sentences in the same chapter, as shown in Table 2.",
        "For example, the 39th sentence in the same chapter contains \"As you can see,\" as",
        "shown in Figure 3.",
        "The sentences that contain some words in common with sentence (2.1) provide information that is very useful for deriving a correct parse of the sentence.",
        "Table 2 also shows that the parts of speech (POS) for most words in sentence (2.1) can be derived from words repeated in other sentences in the same chapter.",
        "In this table, the uppercase letters below the top sentence indicate the parts of speech that can be assigned to the words above.",
        "Underneath the candidate part of speech, repeated phases in other sentences are presented along with the part of speech of each word in those sentences; thus, the first word of sentence (2.1), \"As,\" can be a conjunction, an adverb, or a preposition, but complete parses of the 39th and 175th sentences indicate that in this discourse the word is used as a conjunction when it is used in the phrase \"As you can see.\"",
        "Furthermore, information on the dependencies among most words in sentence (2.1) can be extracted from phrases repeated in other sentences in the same chapter, as shown in Figure 4.2 2 Thick arrows indicate dependencies extracted from the discourse information."

        "The first step of the procedure is to extract from an input text discourse information that the system can refer to in the next step in order to complete incomplete parses.",

        "In accumulating discourse information, a score of 1.0 is awarded for each definite modifiee-modifier relationship.",
        "A lower score, 0.1, is awarded for each ambiguous modifiee-modifier relationship, since such relationships are less reliable.",
        "2.",
        "When all the sentences have been parsed, the discourse information is used to select the most preferable candidate for sentences with multiple possible parses, and the data of the selected parse are added to the discourse information.",
        "After all the sentences except the ill-formed sentences that caused incomplete parses have provided data for use as discourse information, the parse completion procedure begins.",
        "The initial data used in the completion procedure are a set of partial parses generated by a bottom-up parser as an incomplete parse tree.",
        "For example, the PEG parser generated three partial parses for sentence (2.1), consisting of \"As you can see,\" \"you can choose from many topics,\" and \"to find out what information is available about the AS/ 400 system,\" as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Since partial parses are generated by means of grammar rules in a parser, we decided to restructure each partial parse and unify them according to the discourse information, rather than construct the whole parse tree from discourse information.",
        "The completion procedure consists of two steps: Step 1: Inspecting each partial parse and restructuring it on the basis of the discourse information For each word in a partial parse, the part of speech and the modifiee-modifier relationships with other words are inspected.",
        "If they are different from those",
        "in the discourse information, the partial parse is restructured according to the discourse information.",
        "For example, Figure 5 shows an incomplete parse of the following sentence, which is the 43rd sentence in a technical text that consists of 175 sentences.3 (3.1) Fig. 3 is an isometric view of the magazine taken from the operator's side with one cartridge shown in an unprocessed position and two cartridges shown in a processed position.",
        "In the second partial parse, the word \"side\" is analyzed as a verb.",
        "The same word appears fifteen times in the discourse information extracted from well-formed sentences, and is analyzed as a noun every time it appears in complete parses; furthermore, there are no data on the noun \"operator\" modifying the verb \"take\" through the preposition \"from,\" while there is information on the noun \"operator's\" modifying the noun \"side,\" as in sentence (3.2), and on the noun \"side\" modifying the verb \"take,\" as in sentence (3.3).",

        "(151st sentence) (3.3) Fig. 4 is an isometric view of the magazine taken from the machine side with one cartridge shown in the unprocessed position and two cartridges shown in the processed position.",
        "(44th sentence) Therefore, these two partial parses are restructured by changing the part of speech of the word \"side\" to noun, and the modifiee of the noun \"operator\" to",
        "the noun \"side,\" while at the same time changing the modifiee of the noun \"side\" to the verb \"take.\"",
        "As a result, a unified parse is obtained, as shown in Figure 6.",
        "Step 2: Joining partial parses on the basis of the discourse information If the partial parses are not unified into a single structure in the previous step, they are joined together on the basis of the discourse information until a unified parse is obtained.",
        "Partial parses are joined as follows: First, the possibility of joining the first two partial parses is examined, then, either the unification of the first two parses or the second parse is examined to determine whether it can be joined to the third parse, then the examination moves to the next parse, and so on.",
        "Two partial parses are joined if the root (head node) of either parse tree can modify a node in the other parse without crossing the modification of other nodes.",
        "To examine the possibility of modification, discourse information is applied at three different levels.",
        "First, for a candidate modifier and modifiee, an identical pattern containing the modifier word and the modifiee word in the same part of speech and in the same relationship is searched for in the discourse information.",
        "Next, if there is no identical pattern, a modification pattern with a synonym (Collins, 1984) of the node on one side is searched for in the discourse information.",
        "Then, if this also fails, a modification pattern containing a word that has the same part of speech as the word on one side of the node is searched for.",
        "Since the discourse information consists of modification patterns extracted from complete parses, it reflects the grammar rules of the parser, and a matching pattern with a part of speech rather than an actual word on one side can be regarded as a relaxation rule, in the sense that syntactic and semantic constraints are less restrictive than the corresponding grammar rule in the parser.",
        "These matching conditions at different levels are applied in such a manner that partial parses are joined through the most preferable nodes."

        "We have implemented this method on an English-to-Japanese machine translation system called Shalt2 (Takeda et al., 1992), and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of this method.",
        "Table 4 gives the result of our experiments on two technical documents of different kinds, one a patent document (text 1), and the other a computer manual (text 2).",
        "Since text 1 contained longer and more complex sentences than text 2, our ESG parser failed to generate unified parses more often in text 1; on the other hand, the frequency of morphologically identical words and collocation patterns was higher in text 1, and our method was more effective in text 1.",
        "In both texts, the discourse information provided enough information to unify partial parses of an incomplete parse in more than half of the cases.",
        "However, the resulting unified parses were not always correct.",
        "Since sentences with incomplete parses are usually quite long and contain complicated structures, it is hard to obtain a perfect analysis for those sentences.",
        "Thus, in order to evaluate the improvement in the output translation rather than the improvement in the rate of success in syntactic analysis, in which only perfect analyses are counted, we compared output translations generated with and without the application of our method.",
        "When our method was not applied, partial parses of an incomplete parse were joined by means of some heuristic rules such as the one that joins a partial parse with \"NP\" in its root node to a partial parse with \"VP\" in its root node, and the root node of the second partial parse was joined to the last node of the first partial parse by default.",
        "When the discourse information did not provide enough information to unify partial parses with the application of our method, the heuristic rules were applied.",
        "In such cases the default rule of joining the root node of the second partial parse to the last node of the first partial parse was mostly applied, since the least restrictive matching patterns in our method were similar to the heuristic rules.",
        "Thus, the system generated a unified parse for each sentence regardless of the discourse information, and we compared the output translations generated with and without the application of our method.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "The translations were compared by checking how well the output Japanese sentence conveyed the meaning of the input English sentence.",
        "Since most unified parses contained various errors, such as incorrect modification patterns and incorrect parts of speech assigned to some words, fewer errors generally resulted in better translations, but incorrect parts of speech resulted in worse translations."

      "text": [
        "We have proposed a method for completing partial parses of ill-formed sentences on the basis of information extracted from complete parses of well-formed sentences in the discourse.",
        "Our approach to handling ill-formed sentences is fundamentally different from previous ones in that it reanalyzes the part of speech and modifiee-modifier relationships of each word in an ill-formed sentence by using information extracted from analyses of other sentences in the same text, thus, attempting to generate the analysis most appropriate to the discourse.",
        "The results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method; moreover, implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation.",
        "Since this method has a simple framework that does not require any extra knowledge resources or inference mechanisms, it is robust and suitable for a practical natural language processing system.",
        "Furthermore, in terms of the turnaround time (TAT) of the whole translation procedure, the improvement in the parses achieved by using this method along with other disambiguation methods involving discourse information, as shown in another paper (Nasukawa, 1995), shortened the TAT in the late stages of the translation procedure,",
        "and compensated for the extra TAT required as a result of using the discourse information, provided the size of the discourse was kept to between 100 and 300 sentences.",
        "In this paper, the term \"discourse\" is used as a set of words in a text together with the usage of each of those words in that text – namely, a part of speech and modifiee-modifier relationships with other words.",
        "The basic idea of our method is to improve the accuracy of sentence analysis simply by maintaining consistency in the usage of morphologically identical words within the same text.",
        "Thus, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the source text, since it presupposes that morphologically identical words are likely to be repeated in the same text.",
        "However, the results have been encouraging at least with technical documents such as computer manuals, where words with the same lemma are frequently repeated in a small area of text.",
        "Moreover, our method improves the translation accuracy, especially for frequently repeated phrases, which are usually considered to be important, and leads to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the natural language processing system."
