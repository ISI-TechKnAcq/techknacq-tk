        "In recent years, speech-to-speech translation (S2S) technology has played an increasingly important role in narrowing the language barrier in cross-lingual interpersonal communication.",
        "The improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), statistical machine translation (MT), and, text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) technology has facilitated the serial binding of these individual components to achieve S2S translation of acceptable quality.",
        "Prior work on S2S translation has primarily focused on providing either one-way or two-way translation on a single device (Waibel et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2003).",
        "Typically, the user interface requires the participant(s) to choose the source and target language apriori.",
        "The nature of communication, either single user talking or turn taking between two users can result in a one-way or cross-lingual dialog interaction.",
        "In most systems, the necessity to choose the directionality of translation for each turn does take away from a natural dialog flow.",
        "Furthermore, single interface based S2S translation (embedded or cloud-based) is not suitable for cross-lingual communication when participants are geographically distant, a scenario more likely in a global setting.",
        "In such a scenario, it is imperative to provide real-time and low latency communication.",
        "In a conventional telephone conversation between two speakers of the same language, the interaction is real-time and the speakers process the information stream incrementally.",
        "Similarly, cross-lingual dialog between two remote participants will greatly benefit through incremental translation.",
        "While incremental decoding for text translation has been addressed previously in (Furuse and Iida, 1996; Sankaran et al., 2010), we address the problem in a speech-to-speech translation setting for enabling real-time cross-lingual dialog.",
        "We address the problem of incrementality in a novel session initiation protocol (SIP) based S2S translation system that enables two people to interact and engage in cross-lingual dialog over a telephone (mobile phone or landline).",
        "Our system performs incremental speech recognition and translation, allowing for low latency interaction that provides an ideal setting for remote dialog aimed at accomplishing a task.",
        "We present previous work in this area in Section 2 and introduce the problem of incremental translation in Section 3.",
        "We describe the statistical models used in the S2S translation framework in Section 4 followed by a description of the SIP communication",
        "framework for real-time translation in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6, we describe the basic call flow of our system following which we present dialog experiments performed using our framework in Section 8.",

        "The device typically supports multiple source-target language pairs.",
        "A user typically chooses the directionality of translation and a toggle feature is used to switch the directionality.",
        "However, this requires physical presence of the two conversants in one location.",
        "On the other hand, text chat between users over cell phones has become increasingly popular in the last decade.",
        "While the language used in the interaction is typically monolingual, there have been attempts to use statistical machine translation to enable cross-lingual text communication (Chen and Raman, 2008).",
        "But this introduces a significant overhead as the users need to type in the responses for each turn.",
        "Moreover, statistical translation systems are typically unable to cope with telegraphic text present in chat messages.",
        "A more user friendly approach would be to use speech as the modality for communication.",
        "One of the first attempts for two-way S2S translation over a telephone between two potentially remote participants was made as part of the Verbmobil project (Wahlster, 2000).",
        "The system was restricted to certain topics and speech was the only modality.",
        "Furthermore, the spontaneous translation of dialogs was not incremental.",
        "One of the first attempts at incremental text translation was demonstrated in (Furuse and Iida, 1996) using a transfer-driven machine translation approach.",
        "More recently, an incremental decoding framework for text translation was presented in (Sankaran et al., 2010).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, incremental speech-to-speech translation in a dialog setting has not been addressed in prior work.",
        "In this work, we address this problem using first of a kind SIP-based large vocabulary S2S translation system that can work with both smart-phones and landlines.",

        "In this paper, we introduced the problem of incremental speech-to-speech translation and presented first of a kind two-way real-time speech-to-speech translation system based on SIP that incorporates the notion of incrementality.",
        "We presented details about the SIP framework and demonstrated the typical call flow in our application.",
        "We also presented a dialog corpus collected using our framework and benchmarked the performance of the system.",
        "Our framework allows for incremental speech translation and can provide low latency translation.",
        "We are currently working on improving the accuracy of incremental translation.",
        "We are also exploring new algorithms for performing reordering aware incremental speech-to-speech translation, i.e., translating source phrases such that text-to-speech synthesis can be rendered incrementally."
