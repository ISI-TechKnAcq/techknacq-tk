        "The time requirement of the algorithm is determined by the size of the search space, i.e. the complexity of the resulting network when the error model is applied to the misspelt string and intersected with the dictionary6.",
        "To optimise the application of edit distance by limiting the search space, many traditional spell checkers will not attempt to correct the very first letter of the word form.",

        "As far as we know, the complete justification for this belief remains to be made with a high-quality, hand-checked error corpus.",
        "On the error model side this optimisation has been justified by findings where between 1.5 % and 15 % of spelling errors happen in the first character of the word, depending on the text type (Bhagat, 2007); the 1.5 % from a small corpus of academic texts (Yan-nakoudakis and Fawthrop, 1983) and 15 % from dictated corpora (Kukich, 1992).",

        "Furthermore, we noticed that when evenly splitting the word forms in three parts, 15 % of the errors are in the first third of the word form, while second has 47 % and third 38 %, which would be in favor of discarding initial errors7.",
        "A second form of optimisation that is used by many traditional spell-checking systems is to apply a lower order edit distance separately before trying higher order ones.",
        "This is based on the assumption that the vast majority of spelling errors will be of lower order.",
        "In the original account of edit distance for spell-checking, 80 % of the spelling errors were found to be correctable with distance 1 (Pollock and Zamora, 1984).",

        "This contrasts to our findings with real world errors, that the distribution of errors tends towards the end of the word, described in 2.2 and (Bhagat, 2007), but it should be noted that degradation can be as bad as given here.",
        "Finally we measure how the text type used will affect the speed of spell-checking.",
        "As the best-case scenario we use the unmodified texts of Wikipedia, which contain probably the most realistic native-language-speaker-like typing error dis-13Which, in the absence of suitable error corpora and a more full-fledged language model taking context into account, would be irrelevant for the goal at hand.",
        "tribution available.",
        "For text with more errors, where the majority of errors should be recoverable, we introduce automatically generated errors in the Wikipedia texts.",
        "Finally to see the performance in the worst case scenario where most of the words have unrecoverable spelling errors we use texts from other languages, in this case English texts for Finnish and Greenlandic spell-checking and Finnish texts for English spell-checking, which should bring us close to the lower bounds on performance.",
        "The effects of text type (i.e. frequency of non-words) on speed of spell-checking is given in Table 6.",
        "All of the tests in this category were performed with error models under the avoid redundancy and firsts ed 2 row in previous tables, which gave us the best speed/quality ratio.",

        "Here we chiefly note that the amount of non-words in text directly reflects the speed of spell-checking.",

        "In this article, we built a full-fledged finite-state spell-checking system from existing finite-state language models and generated error models.",
        "This work uses the system initially described in Pirinen and Linde?n (2010) and an algorithm described in Linde?n et al. (2012), providing an extensive quantitative evaluation of various combinations of constituents for such a system, and applying it to the most challenging linguistic environments available for testing.",
        "We showed that using on-line composition of the word form, error model and dictionary is usable for morphologically complex languages.",
        "Furthermore we showed that the error models can be automatically optimised in several ways to gain some speed at cost of recall.",
        "We showed that the memory consumption of the spell-checking process is mainly unaffected by the selection of error model, apart from the need to store a greater set of suggestions for models that generate more suggestions.",
        "The error models may therefore be quite freely changed in real world applications as needed.",
        "We verified that correcting only the first input letter affords a significant speed improvement, but that this improvement is not greatly dependent on the position of such a restriction.",
        "This practice is somewhat supported by our tentative finding that it may cause the least drop in practical recall figures, at least in Finnish.",
        "It is promising especially in conjunction with a fallback model that does correct the first letter.",
        "We described a way to avoid having a finite-state error model perform redundant work, such as deleting and inserting the same letter in succession.",
        "The practical improvement from doing this is extremely modest, and it increases the size of the error model.",
        "In this research we focused on differences in automatically generated error models and their optimisations in the case of morphologically complex languages.",
        "For future research we intend to study more realistic error models induced from actual error corpora (e.g. Brill and Moore (2000)).",
        "Research into different ways to induce weights into the language models, as well as further use of context in finite-state spell-checking (as in Pirinen et al. (2012)), is warranted."
