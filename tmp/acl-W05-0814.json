        "ISI participated in the WPT05 Romanian-English word alignment task.",
        "The system used for baseline experiments is two runs of IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) in the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) implementation, which includes smoothing extensions to Model 4.",
        "For symmetrization, we found that Och and Ney’s “refined” technique described in (Och and Ney, 2003) produced the best AER for this data set under all experimental conditions.",
        "We experimented with a statistical model for inducing a stemmer cross-lingually, but found that the best performance was obtained by simply lower-casing both the English and Romanian text and removing all but the first four characters of each word.",
        "We also tried a new model and a new training criterion based on alternating the maximization of likelihood and minimization of the alignment error rate.",
        "For these experiments, we have implemented",
        "an alignment package for IBM Model 4 using a hill-climbing search and Viterbi training as described in (Brown et al., 1993), and extended this to use new submodels.",
        "The starting point is the final alignment generated using GIZA++’s implementation of IBM Model 1 and the Aachen HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "Paper organization: Section 2 is on the baseline, Section 3 discusses vocabulary reduction, Section 4 introduces our new model and training method, Section 5 describes experiments, Section 6 concludes.",
        "We use the following notation: e refers to an English sentence composed of English words labeled ez.",
        "f refers to a Romanian sentence composed of Romanian words labeled fj.",
        "a is an alignment of e to f .",
        "We use the term “Viterbi alignment” to denote the most probable alignment we can find, rather than the true Viterbi alignment."

        "To train our systems, Model 4 was trained two times, first using Romanian as the source language and then using English as the source language.",

        "For the distortion calculations of Model 4, we removed the dependencies on Romanian and English word classes.",
        "We applied the “union”, “intersection” and “refined” symmetrization metrics (Och and Ney, 2003) to the final alignments output from training, as well as evaluating the two final alignments directly.",

        "Romanian is a Romance language which has a system of suffixes for inflection which is richer than English.",
        "Given the small amount of training data, we decided that vocabulary size reduction was desirable.",
        "As a baseline for vocabulary reduction, we tried reducing words to prefixes of varying sizes for both English and Romanian after lowercasing the corpora.",
        "We also tried Porter stemming (Porter, 1997) for English.",
        "(Rogati et al., 2003) extended Model 1 with an additional hidden variable to represent the split points in Arabic between the prefix, the stem and the suffix to generate a stemming for use in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval.",
        "As in (Rogati et al., 2003), we can find the most probable stemming given the model, apply this stemming, and retrain our word alignment system.",
        "However, we can also use the modified model directly to find the best word alignment without converting the text to its stemmed form.",
        "We introduce a variable rj for the Romanian stem and a variable sj for the Romanian suffix (which when concatenated together give us the Romanian word fj) into the formula for the probability of generating a Romanian word fj using an alignment aj given only an English sentence e. We use the index z to denote a particular stemming possibility.",
        "For a given Romanian word the stemming possibilities are simply every possible split point where the stem is at least one character (this includes the null suffix).",
        "If the assumption is made that the stem and the suffix are generated independently from e, we can assume conditional independence.",
        "We performed two sets of experiments, one set where the English was stemmed using the Porter stemmer and one set where each English word was stemmed down to its first four characters.",
        "We tried the best performing scoring heuristic for Arabic from (Rogati et al., 2003) where p(sj,z, aj Ie) is modeled using the heuristic p(s j,z I lj) where sj,z is the Romanian suffix, and lj is the last letter of the Romanian word fj; these adjustments are updated during EM training.",
        "We also tried several other approximations of p(sj,z, aj Ie) with and without updates in EM training.",
        "We were unable to produce better results and elected to use the baseline vocabulary reduction technique for the shared task."
