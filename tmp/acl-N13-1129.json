      "text": [
        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in methods for incremental natural language understanding (NLU) for spoken dialogue systems; see e.g. (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Sagae et al., 2009; Schlangen et al., 2009; Heintze et al., 2010; DeVault et al., 2011a; Selfridge et al., 2012).",
        "This work has generally been motivated by a desire to make dialogue systems more efficient and more natural, by enabling them to provide lower latency responses (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009), human-like feedback such as backchannels that indicate how well the system is understanding user speech (DeVault et al., 2011b; Traum et al., 2012), and more interactive response capabilities such as collaborative completions of user utterances (DeVault et al., 2011a), more adaptive handling of interruptions (Buschmeier et al., 2012), and others.",
        "This paper builds on techniques developed in previous work that has adopted a predictive approach to incremental NLU (DeVault et al., 2011a).",
        "On this approach, at specific moments while a user's speech is in progress, an attempt is made to predict what the full meaning of the complete user utterance will be.",
        "Predictive models can be contrasted with explicit approaches to incremental NLU.",
        "We use the term explicit understanding to refer to approaches that attempt to determine the meaning that has been expressed explicitly in the user's partial utterance so far (without predicting further aspects of meaning to come).",
        "Explicit understanding of partial utterances can be implemented using statistical classification or sequential tagging models (Heintze et al., 2010).",
        "Both predictive and explicit incremental NLU capabilities can be valuable in a dialogue system.",
        "Prediction can support specific response capabilities, such as system completion of user utterances (DeVault et al., 2011a) and reduced response latency.1 However, explicit models support additional and complementary capabilities.",
        "For instance, depending on the application domain (Heintze et al., 2010) and on the individual utterance (DeVault et al., 2011b), it may be difficult for a system to predict a user's impending meaning with confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, it may often be possible for systems to determine the meaning of what a user has said so far, and to take action based on this partial understanding.",
        "As one example, items in a user interface could be highlighted when mentioned by a user (Bu?",
        "and Schlangen, 2011).",
        "Another capability would be to provide grounding feedback, such as verbal back-channels or head nods (in embodied systems), to indicate when the system is understanding the user's meaning (Traum et al., 2012).",
        "Explicit utterance meanings also allow a system to distinguish between meaning that has been expressed and meaning that is merely implied or inferred, which may be less reliable.",
        "In the near future, as incremental processing capabilities in dialogue systems grow, it may prove valuable for dialogue systems to combine both predictive and explicit incremental understanding capabilities.",
        "In this paper, we present a technique for approximating a user's explicit meaning using an existing predictive understanding framework (DeVault et al., 2011a).",
        "The specific new contributions in this paper are (1) to show that 1A simple approach to reducing response latency is to begin to plan a response to the predicted meaning while the user is still speaking.",
        "an estimate of a user's explicit utterance meaning can be derived from this kind of predictive understanding model (Section 2); (2) to quantify the performance of this new method in a corpus evaluation (Section 3); (3) to provide concrete examples and discussion of the annotation costs associated with implementing this technique, in relation to some alternative approaches to explicit understanding (Section 4).",
        "Our results and discussion show that the proposed method offers promising performance, has relatively low annotation costs, and enables explicit and predictive understanding to be easily combined within a dialogue system.",
        "It may therefore be a useful incremental understanding technique for some dialogue systems."

        "We have seen two examples of this already, for the partial ASR result hello in Figure 2, and for the partial ASR result we will in Figure 3.",
        "A second observation in Figure 4 is that precision remains better against the complete utterance frame than against the hand-annotated subframe (at all threshold levels).",
        "This indicates that the explicit subframes are often still predicting some aspects of the full frame.",
        "An example of this is given in Figure 5, where the user's partial utterance we need to is assigned an explicit subframe that includes frame elements describing an event of moving the clinic, which the user has not said explicitly.",
        "This happens because, in the SASO-EN domain, in fact there is nothing else that the interlocutors need to do besides move the clinic.",
        "So based on the NLU training data, the data-driven probabilities assigned by Equation (1) describe the additional frame elements as about as probable as the ones capturing the we need to part of the semantics (given at the right).",
        "Finally, a third observation is that overall, the precision, recall, and F-score results against the annotated subframes using our method are surprisingly strong.",
        "For example, when evaluating the explicit subframes over all partial ASR results, an F-score of 0.75 is attained at thresholds in the range 0.5-0.55.",
        "This F-score is substantially better than the F-score of our predictive NLU in relation to the final full frames, which is 0.56 when evaluated over all partial ASR results.",
        "This means that our proposed model works better as an explicit incremental NLU than mxNLU works as a predictive incremental NLU.",
        "Further, we observe that this F-score of 0.75 against hand-annotated subframes is approximately as good as the F-score of 0.76 that is achieved when mxNLU is used to interpret complete utterances.",

        "One attractive aspect of our technique is that the only semantic annotation that is required is the association of complete user utterances with complete NLU output frames.",
        "This task can be performed by anyone familiar with the scenario and the semantic frame format, such as a system developer or scenario designer.",
        "In fact, the annotation of the SASO-EN data set we use in this paper has been described in (DeVault et al., 2010), which reports that the overall corpus of 4678 token utterances was semantically annotated at an average rate of about 10 seconds per unique utterance.",
        "The model in Equation (2) is what (Heintze et al., 2010) call a hybrid output approach, in which larger and larger frames are provided as partial input grows, but in which a detailed alignment between surface text and frames is not provided by the incremental NLU component.",
        "They contrast hybrid output systems with techniques that deliver either whole-frame output (like the predictive mxNLU) or aligned output that connects individual words to their meanings.",
        "A data-driven approach to providing aligned outputs would involve preparing a more detailed annotated corpus that aligns individual words and surface expressions to their corresponding frame elements.",
        "Given such a word-aligned corpus, one could train several kinds of models to produce the aligned outputs incrementally.",
        "One strategy would be to use a sequential tagging model such as a CRF to tag partial utterances with the frame elements that capture their explicit meaning, as in (Heintze et al., 2010).",
        "Using a machine learning approach that models a more detailed alignment between surface text and frames would be one way to more cleanly separate explicit from predictive aspects of meaning.",
        "Preparing the training data for such models, however, would create additional annotation costs.",
        "As part of creating the annotated subframes for the evaluation presented in Section 3, we measured the time requirement for such annotation of word-meaning alignments at about 30 seconds per unique utterance.",
        "Performing full word-meaning alignment therefore takes about three times as much time as the complete utterance annotation needed for our technique.",
        "Ad",
        "ditionally, this task requires a greater degree of linguistic knowledge and sophistication, as the annotator must be able to segment the utterance and align specific surface segments with potentially complex aspects of meaning such as modality, polarity, speech act types, and others.",
        "An example of the kinds of complexities that arise is illustrated in Figure 3, where the relationship between specific words like ?provide?",
        "and ?transportation?",
        "to frame elements like <S>.sem.event move and <S>.sem.theme clinic is not transparent, even if it is straightforward to mark the whole utterance as conveying that meaning in this domain.",
        "We have generally found this alignment task challenging for people without advanced linguistics training.",
        "The reason we describe the method in this paper as an approximation of explicit NLU is that, partly because it is trained without detailed word-meaning alignments, it can be expected to occasionally include some predictive aspects of user utterance meaning.",
        "An example of this is the method's explicit subframe output for the phrase we need to in Figure 5.",
        "Another way to approximate explicit NLU would be using the method (Heintze et al., 2010) call an ensemble of classifiers; it involves training an individual classifier for each frame key.",
        "Like the method presented here, an ensemble of classifiers can be easily trained to predict those frame elements that will appear in the final frame Gu for each utterance.",
        "And like our method, prediction with an ensemble of classifiers does not require detailed annotation of word-meaning alignment in the training data.",
        "One difference is that, with our method, by selecting an appropriate threshold, it is easy to enforce certain consistency properties on subframe outputs.",
        "In an ensemble of classifiers approach, there is no immediate guarantee that the output frame constructed by the independent classifiers will be internally consistent from the standpoint of downstream system modules (Heintze et al., 2010).",
        "For example, in the SASO-EN domain, an NLU frame should not contain frame elements that mix aspects of events and states in the SASO-EN ontology; e.g., the frame element <S>.sem.type event should not co-occur in an NLU output frame with the frame element <S>.sem.object-id market (which would be appropriate for a state frame but not for an event frame).",
        "With the method proposed here, if we select a threshold ?",
        "that is greater than 0.5, and if none of the complete NLU frames contain incompatible key values (which is relatively easy to enforce as part of the annotation task), then it will be mathematically impossible for two incompatible frame elements to be returned in a subframe.3 Ultimately, a classification method that is trained on word-meaning aligned data and that uses additional techniques to ensure that only valid, grammatical output frames are produced could prove to be an attractive approach.",
