        "In recent years, neural network language models (NNLMs) have become popular architectures for learning word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b).",
        "Most of the previous NNLMs represent each word with a single embedding, which ignores polysemy.",

        "In this method, word sense induction (WSI) is performed prior to the training of NNLMs.",

        "In the RNNLM, U is the embedding matrix, where each column vector represents a word.",
        "As discussed in Section 1, the RNNLM and even most NNLMs ignore the polysemy phenomenon in natural languages and induce a single embedding for each word.",

        "The training process is exactly the same as single embeddings, except that the words in our training corpus has been labeled with senses.",
