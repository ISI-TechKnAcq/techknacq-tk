        "It allows the user to type a sentence in English text, and then processes it so that the synthesiser will output it with natural-sounding inflection; that is, as well as transcribing text to a phonemic form that can be read by the system, it assigns this text an f0 contour.",
        "The assigning of this stress is described in this paper, and it is asserted that the problem can be solved with reference to two main levels, the sentential and the syllabic.",
        "0.\"General The paper is divided into three main sections Firstly, Section 1 deals with the problem of stress, its various components and their relative importance.",
        "It also discusses (briefly) the two-level nature of the problem.",
        "Part II examines the problems that the model must face in dealing with stress assignment, and further develops the contention that these problems must be dealt with at the sentential and the syllabic levels.",
        "It proposes a phonological solution to the problem of syllabic stress, based on the Dependency Phonology framework, and suggests a modified function and content word algorithm to deal with sentential stress assignment.",
        "Part III deals with the actual algorithms developed to deal with the problems.",
        "A fair amount of familiarity with Prolog is assumed, but the code itself is not examined too deeply.",
        "In addition, possible improvements are discussed, briefly, at the end of the paper.",
        "As this program is a prototype, there will be many such improvements, although there are no plans to produce an enhanced model at the present date.",
        "It should also be borne in mind that as this paper is primarily a report on a piece of software the linguistic bases behind some of the algorithms are by no means dealt with as comprehensively as they might be.",

        "The Role of Stress in Utterances This is hi me-means intended to be a comprehensive analysis of stress assignment in English, rather it is a brief review of some of the most important acoustic factors which together go to make up the perceptual phenomenon of stress, and in particular those factors most relevant to the text-to-speech program.",
        "Stress is the name given to the group of acoustic phenomena that result in the perception of some words in utterances as being more important than others.",
        "There is no one-to-one correspondence of the acoustic level with the perceptual one, but all the members of the above group contribute to some extent, soma with more effect than others.",

        "For example, consider the two examples below.",

        "-Now at: British Telecom Research Laboratories, Martlesham Heath,-Ipswich, Suffolk IP5 7RE, UK",
        "An important point arises here; this is that although the meaning of the whole sentence is changed by the different intonation pattern, the actual words themselves retain the same meaning in both examples.",
        "That is, there are two levels of semantic information contained within a sentence; morphological (word level) and sentential (utterance level).",
        "This distinction is important and runs through the whole problem of synthetic stress assignment, and will be considered in more detail later in the paper.",
        "Although sentential stress often varies, morphological stress does so much less frequently.",
        "For instance, the stressed syllable is the first one in the word \"elephant\".",
        "To put it on the second syllable would destroy the semantic message conveyed by the word \"elephant\".",
        "When morphological stress does differ within the same word, it invariably accompanies a radical difference in the semantics of a verb, and is usually syntactically defined; viz project (the noun) as opposed to project (the verb).",

        "For instance, consider the following phrase (taken to mean \"do continue\"): Go on.",
        "Clearly in this common utterance, it is the \"on\" that is emphasised, and it can easily be seen that pitch is lower for this word.",

        "This is the theory that has been implemented in GEI7IE, and although at present it is in a prototype stage only, it works well.",
        "This solution takes as its base the Dependency model of vowel space, and proposes that it is possible, at least for English and possibly for other stress languages, to predict syllabic stress on the position of the syllabic nucleus within a \"sonance hierarchy\".",
