        "For the purposes of this paper, a multilingual text means one containing text segments, limited to those longer than a clause, written in different languages.",
        "We can often find such texts in linguistic resources collected from the World Wide Web for many non-major languages, which tend to also contain portions of text in a major language.",
        "In automatic processing of such multilingual texts, they must first be segmented by language, and the language of each segment must be identified, since many state-of-the-art NLP applications are built by learning a gold standard for one specific language.",
        "Moreover, segmentation is useful for other objectives such as collecting linguistic resources for non-major languages and automatically removing portions written in major languages, as noted above.",
        "The study reported here was motivated by this objective.",
        "The problem addressed in this article is thus to segment a multilingual text by language and identify the language of each segment.",
        "In addition, for our objective, the set of target languages consists of not only major languages but also many non-major languages: more than 200 languages in total.",
        "Previous work that directly concerns the problem addressed in this paper is rare.",
        "The most similar previous work that we know of comes from two sources and can be summarized as follows.",
        "First, (Teahan, 2000) attempted to segment multilingual texts by using text segmentation methods used for non-segmented languages.",
        "For this purpose, he used a gold standard of multilingual texts annotated by borders and languages.",
        "This segmentation approach is similar to that of word segmentation for non-segmented texts, and he tested it on six different European languages.",
        "Although the problem setting is similar to ours, the formulation and solution are different, particularly in that our method uses only a monolingual gold standard, not a multilingual one as in Teahan's study.",
        "Second, (Alex, 2005) (Alex et al., 2007) solved the problem of detecting words and phrases in languages other than the principal language of a given text.",
        "They used statistical language modeling and heuristics to detect foreign words and tested the case of English embedded in German texts.",
        "They also reported that such processing would raise the performance of German parsers.",
        "Here again, the problem setting is similar to ours but not exactly the same, since the embedded text portions were assumed to be words.",
        "Moreover, the authors only tested for the specific language pair of English embedded in German texts.",
        "In contrast, our work considers more than 200 languages, and the portions of embedded text are larger: up to the paragraph level to accommodate the reality of multilingual texts.",
        "The extension of our work to address the foreign word detection problem would be an interesting future work.",
        "From a broader view, the problem addressed in this paper is further related to two genres of previous work.",
        "The first genre is text segmentation.",
        "Our problem can be situated as a sub-problem from the viewpoint of language change.",
        "A more common setting in the NLP context is segmentation into semantically coherent text portions, of which a representative method is text tiling as reported by (Hearst, 1997).",
        "There could be other possible bases for text",
        "segmentation, and our study, in a way, could lead to generalizing the problem.",
        "The second genre is classification, and the specific problem of text classification by language has drawn substantial attention (Grefenstette, 1995) (Kruengkrai et al., 2005) (Kikui, 1996).",
        "Current state-of-the-art solutions use machine learning methods for languages with abundant supervision, and the performance is usually high enough for practical use.",
        "This article concerns that problem together with segmentation but has another particularity in aiming at classification into a substantial number of categories, i.e., more than 200 languages.",
        "This means that the amount of training data has to remain small, so the methods to be adopted must take this point into consideration.",
        "Among works on text classification into languages, our proposal is based on previous studies using cross-entropy such as (Teahan, 2000) and (Juola, 1997).",
        "We explain these works in further detail in ?3.",
        "This article presents one way to formulate the segmentation and identification problem as a combinatorial optimization problem; specifically, to find the set of segments and their languages that minimizes the description length of a given multilingual text.",
        "In the following, we describe the problem formulation and a solution to the problem, and then discuss the performance of our method."

        "In our setting, we assume that a small amount (up to kilobytes) of monolingual plain text sample data is available for every language, e.g., the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which serves to generate the language model used for language identification.",
        "This entails two sub-assumptions.",
        "First, we assume that for all multilingual text, every text portion is written in one of the given languages; there is no input text of an unknown language without learning data.",
        "In other words, we use supervised learning.",
        "In line with recent trends in unsupervised segmentation, the problem of finding segments without supervision could be solved through approaches such as Bayesian methods; however, we report our result for the supervised setting since we believe that every segment must be labeled by language to undergo further processing.",
        "Second, we cannot assume a large amount of learning data, since our objective requires us to consider segmentation by both major and non-major languages.",
        "For most non-major languages, only a limited amount of corpus data is available.1 This constraint suggests the difficulty of applying certain state-of the art machine learning methods requiring a large learning corpus.",
        "Hence, our formulation is based on the minimum description length (MDL), which works with relatively small amounts of learning data.",

        "For MMS, the identification accuracy was a little less significant and was about 90.9% even with 100 characters of test data.",
        "The amount of learning data seemed sufficient for both cases, with around 8,000 characters.",
        "In fact, we conducted tests with larger amounts of learning data and found a faster rise with respect to the input length, but the maximum possible accuracy did not show any significant increase.",
        "Errors resulted from either noise or mistakes due to the language family.",
        "The Wikipedia test data was noisy, as mentioned in ?5.1.",
        "As for language family errors, the test data includes many similar languages that are difficult even for humans to correctly judge.",
        "For example, Indonesian and Malay, Picard and Walloon, and Norwegian Bokma?l and Nynorsk are all pairs representative of such confusion.",
        "Overall, the language identification performance seems sufficient to justify its application to our main problem of text segmentation by language."

        "Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution obtained for segment border detection.",

        "In each graph, the horizontal axis indicates precision and the vertical axis indicates recall.",
        "The numbers appearing in each figure are the maximum F-score values for each method and data set combination.",
        "As can be seen from these numbers, the language identification performance was high.",
        "Since the text portion size was chosen from among the values 40, 80, 120, or 160, the performance is comprehensible from the results shown in ?6.1.",
        "Note also that PPM performed slightly better than did MMS.",
        "For segment border performance (lower graph), however, the results were limited.",
        "The main reason for this is that both MMS and PPM tend to detect a border one character earlier than the correct location, as was seen in Figure 2.",
        "At the same time, much of the test data contains unrealistic borders",
        "within a word, since the data was generated by concatenating two text portions with random borders.",
        "Therefore, we repeated the experiment with Test2 under the constraint that a segment border could occur only at a bordering location, as explained in ?5.2.",
        "The results with this constraint were significantly better, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "The best result was for UDHR with PPM at 0.9411.",
        "We could also observe how PPM performed better at detecting borders in this case.",
        "In actual application, it would be possible to improve performance by relaxing the procedural conditions, such as by decreasing the number of language possibilities.",
        "In this experiment for Test2, k ranged from 1 to 5, but the performance was not affected by the size of k. When the F-score was examined with respect to k, it remained almost equal to k in all cases.",
        "This shows how each recursion of formula (4) works almost independently, having segmentation and language identification functions that are both robust.",
        "Lastly, we examine the speed of our method.",
        "Since |L |is constant throughout the comparison, 11The language identification accuracy slightly increased as well, by 0.002. the time should increase linearly with respect to the input length |X|, with increasing k having no effect.",
        "Figure 5 shows the speed for Test2 processing, with the horizontal axis indicating the input length and the vertical axis indicating the processing time.",
        "Here, all character offsets were taken into consideration, and the processing was done on a machine with a Xeon5650 2.66-GHz CPU.",
        "The results confirm that the complexity increased linearly with respect to the input length.",
        "When the text size became as large as several thousand characters, the processing time became as long as a second.",

        "This article has presented a method for segmenting a multilingual text into segments, each in a different language.",
        "This task could serve for preprocessing of multilingual texts before applying language-specific analysis to each text.",
        "Moreover, the proposed method could be used to generate corpora in a variety of languages, since many texts in minor languages tend to contain chunks in a major language.",
        "The segmentation task was modeled as an optimization problem of finding the best segment and language sequences to minimize the description length of a given text.",
        "An actual procedure for obtaining an optimal result through dynamic programming was proposed.",
        "Furthermore, we showed a way to decrease the computational complexity substantially, with each of our two methods having linear complexity in the input length.",
        "Various empirical results were shown for language identification and segmentation.",
        "Overall, when segmenting a text with up to five random portions of different languages, where each portion consisted of 40 to 120 characters, the best F-scores for language identification and segmentation were 0.98 and 0.94, respectively.",
        "For our future work, details of the methods must be worked out.",
        "In general, the proposed approach could be further applied to the actual needs of preprocessing and to generating corpora of minor languages."
