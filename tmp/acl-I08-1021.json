        "Scenario template creation (STC) is the problem of generating a common semantic representation from a set of input articles.",
        "For example, given multiple newswire articles on different hurricane incidents, an STC algorithm creates a template that may include slots for the storm's name, current location, direction of travel and magnitude.",
        "Slots in such a scenario template are often to be filled by salient entities in the scenario instance (e.g., \"Hurricane Charley\" or \"the coast area\") but some can also be filled by prominent clauses, verbs or adjectives that describe these salient entities.",
        "Here, we use the term salient aspect (SA) to refer to any of such slot fillers that people would regard as important to describe a particular scenario.",
        "Figure 1 shows such a manually-built scenario template in which details about important actions, actors, time and locations are coded as slots.",
        "STC is an important task that has tangible benefits for many downstream applications.",
        "In the Message Understanding Conference (MUC), manually-generated STs were provided to guide Information Extraction (IE).",
        "An ST can also be viewed as regularizing a set of similar articles as a set of attribute/value tuples, enabling multi-document summarization from filled templates.",
        "Despite these benefits, STC has not received much attention by the community.",
        "We believe this is because it is considered a difficult task that requires deep NL understanding of the source articles.",
        "A problem in applications requiring semantic similarity is that the same word in different contexts may have different senses and play different roles.",
        "Conversely, different words in similar contexts may play similar roles.",
        "This problem makes approaches that rely on word similarity alone inadequate.",
        "We propose a new approach to STC that incorporates the use of contextual information to address this challenge.",
        "Unlike previous approaches that concentrate on the intrinsic similarity of candidate slot fillers, our approach explicitly models contextual evidence.",
        "And unlike approaches to word sense disambiguation (WSD) and other semantic analyses that use neighboring or syntactically related words as contextual evidence, we define contexts by semantic relatedness which extends beyond sentence boundaries.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a case in point with two excerpts from severe storm reports.",
        "Here, although the intrinsic similarity of the main verbs \"hit\" and \"land\" is low, their contextual similarity is high as both are followed by clauses sharing similar subjects (hurricanes) and the same verbs.",
        "Our approach encodes such contextual information as graphs, mapping the STC problem into a general graph overlay problem that is solvable by a variant of Expectation Maximization (EM).",
        "Our work also contributes resources for STC research.",

        "A natural way to automate the process of STC is to cluster similar text spans in the input article set.",

        "Subsequently, these SAs will be generalized into one or more slots in the template, depending on the definition of the text span.",
        "Assuming scenarios are mainly defined by actions, the focus should be on finding appropriate clusters for text spans each of which represents an action.",

        "In contrast to previous approaches, we do not threshold word similarity results; we retain their fractional values and incorporate these values holistically.",
        "Finally, as the same action can be realized in different constructions, the semantic (not just syntactic) roles of verb arguments must be considered, lest agent and patient roles be confused.",
        "For these reasons, we use a semantic role labeler (Pradhan et al., 2004) to provide and delimit the text spans that contain the semantic arguments of a predicate.",

        "We have introduced a new context-sensitive approach to the scenario template creation (STC) problem.",
        "Our method leverages deep NL processing, using semantic role labeler's structured semantic tuples as input.",
        "Despite the use of deeper semantics, we believe that intrinsic semantic similarity by itself is not suficient for clustering.",
        "We have shown this through examples and argue that an approach that considers contextual similarity is necessary.",
        "A key aspect of our work is the incorporation of such contextual information.",
        "Our approach uses a notion of context that combines two aspects: positional similarity (when two tuples are adjacent in the text), and argument similarity (when they have similar arguments).",
        "The set of relevant articles are represented as graphs where contextual evidence is encoded.",
        "By mapping our problem into a graphical formalism, we cast the STC clustering problem as one of multiple graph alignment.",
        "Such a graph alignment is solved by an adaptation of EM, which handles contexts and real-valued similarity by treating both as noisy and potentially unreliable observations.",
        "While scenario template creation (STC) is a dif-icult problem, its evaluation is arguably more dif-icult due to the dearth of suitable resources.",
        "We have compiled and released a corpus of over 700 newswire articles that describe different instances of 15 scenarios, as a suitable input dataset for further STC research.",
        "Using this dataset, we have evaluated and analyzed our context-sensitive approach.",
        "While our results are indicative, they show that considering contextual evidence improves performance."
