        "Specific Phase III goals were to:",
        "• Sustain the successes of Phase I and II in detection, information extraction, architecture, and formal evaluation; • Push research in text processing technologies; • Expand the architecture; • Increase participation with Government agencies, researchers, developers, and the academic community in general; • Expand multilingual and summarization efforts.",
        "The overall purpose was to field a system for use within the operational elements of the Intelligence community and other Government agencies.",
        "Phase III Government participants included the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Naval Research Lab (NRL), the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)"

        "Short descriptions of the 15 research projects can be found in Figure 1.",
        "Additional details on most of these projects can be found in the Phase III papers included in this volume.",
        "Participant research in extraction centered, in general, on three areas: accuracy, usability, and portability.",
        "In order to advance the state of the art, extraction researchers focused core technological efforts on developing algorithms to, for example resolve coreference and use machine learning or related techniques to acquire patterns semi-automatically.",
        "The ultimate goal was to push precision and recall in the scenario task to operationally usable levels.",
        "The common pattern specification language (CPSL) was to be used to facilitate the porting of extraction systems or modules to new domains and languages.",
        "Although, this objective was not fully realized, due to funding constraints, SRI implemented I The 15 research projects referenced in Figure 1 do not include two projects that were selected but not funded by DARPA initially.",
        "The two projects, \"Cross-Language Document Retrieval with Latent Semantic Indexing (University of Colorado) and \" Multilingual Interactive Document Summarization (MINDS)\" (New Mexico State University) were funded by ORD after TIPSTER Phase III began.",

        "For the usability focus, some work focused on determining the optimal role of the user during operational deployment of the technology.",
        "Detection research focused on advancements in the technology and usability.",
        "On the technology side, researchers pursued such topics as the appropriate role for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in detection, the usefulness of shallow extraction in indexing and retrieval, foreign language retrieval, combining different retrieval engines, and the use of machine learning and case-based reasoning.",
        "On the usability side, Phase III detection participants investigated optimal query building approaches to capitalize on the role of the human in the concept of operations.",
        "Usability issues also figured prominently in text summarization, the newest area of TIPSTER-sponsored research that had its beginning in Phase III.",
        "While the focus was on transitioning \"enabling\" technologies from detection and extraction, researchers exploring different strategies for identifying applicable analytic tasks, and assessing the near-term usability of various strategies for user-centric summarization.",
        "Using both statistical and natural language processing techniques, summarization provides a systematic means to reduce the volume of a full text document without losing relevant content.",
        "This technology could be applied to a variety of tasks in order to assist an information searcher.",
        "In TIPSTER Phase III, the Government sponsored several research and development efforts, each with different approaches and potential uses for automatically produced text summaries.",
        "Summarization, due to the multifaceted nature of its output and fluidity of definition, quite naturally employed a cross-technology approach.",
        "Phase III participants leveraged their entity-centered extraction and sentence-level detection methodologies in developing core summarization systems.",
        "We witnessed other cross-technololgy advances.",
        "Detection research involved a more pronounced role for NLP, such as shallow extraction in indexing.",
        "In a similar fashion, extraction researchers explored the use of detection techniques, such as filtering to improve accuracy.",
        "We projected that, had the Architecture Capabilities Platform reached a sufficient level of maturity, the cross-technology approach would have garnered additional advances through the interchange of intermediate results between multiple engines and technologies."

        "To address these",
        "issues, the Architecture Committee (AC) created a number of Technical Working Groups (TWGs) which included representatives of the Government, TIPSTER contractors and others involved in Tipster development.",
        "Four new working groups joined the Pattern Specification TWG, formed under Phase II of TIPSTER.",
        "Goals of the five TWGs are summarized below.",
        "Pattern Specification: This TWG sought to develop a common notation to exchange information about patterns among information extraction developers.",
        "Most information extraction systems operate through a process of pattern matching: successive stages of patterns are used to identify successively larger linguistic units.",
        "In the past, each contractor had used their own notation for these patterns and provided different pattern-matching capabilities which made it harder to achieve a \"plug and play\" architecture goal.",
        "A paper on the findings of this TWG can be found in this volume [2].",
        "Annotation Standardization: The primary means by which text analysis components communicate in the TIPSTER Architecture is through annotations on documents.",
        "The Annotation Standardization TWG aims to define standard annotations for document structure (title, source, author, date, body, etc.",
        "), for tagging names in documents, and for encoding information extraction templates as annotations.",
        "Linking/Tagging: This TWG considered the mechanisms for linking together the copies of a document and for propagating particular attributes onto all the copies attributes needed for security classification or copyright, for example.",
        "This effort was eventually folded into the Annotation Standardization TWG.",
        "Document Management: The architecture design developed under TIPSTER Phase II defined the functionality needed for document management in single-user, single-process environments.",
        "When the Architecture was used in multiprocess or multi-user applications, local extensions were made in such areas as protection and concurrency control.",
        "The document management TWG attempted to standardize these extensions.",
        "Detection: This TWG sought to address capabilities that needed to be added to the detection part of the Architecture, such as the ability to view queries created by relevance feedback and automatic query generation.",
        "it also addressed new issues associated with the extension of the Architecture to use the Z39.50 standard for client-server communication in retrieval systems."

        "The TIPSTER architecture in general and the ACP in particular did not achieve its intended goals.",
        "Part of this was due to the early demise of the TIPSTER Program and part was due to the Government's inability to enforce standards imposed by the TIPSTER software architecture.",
        "These negating factors were compounded by the fact that the architecture was not fully developed and the earlier versions were not fully supported by the developmental efforts.",
        "At the premature end of TIPSTER Phase III, the ACP was not sufficiently developed to truly test interoperability of software modules.",
        "In addition, the Government did not always insist on the TIPSTER architecture being implemented in the demonstration system.",
        "In some cases, it was not feasible to do so, especially for those projects that had begun before the architecture was sufficiently completed.",
        "A notable success indicated that an architecture like TIPSTER's is workable, despite the setbacks.",

        "A major lesson learned concerns that of the inability of a small Government-sponsored effort to influence industry standards.",
