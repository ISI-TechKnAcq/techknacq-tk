      "text": [
        "In many Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, alignment represents an important piece of information, from which translation rules are learnt.",
        "However, while translation models have evolved from word-based to syntax-based modeling, the de facto alignment model remains word-based (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "This gap between alignment modeling and translation modeling is clearly undesirable as it often generates tensions that would prevent the extraction of many useful translation rules (DeNero and Klein, 2007).",
        "Recent work, e.g. by Blunsom et al.",
        "(2009) and Haghihi et al.",
        "(2009) just to name a few, show that alignment models that bear closer resemblance to state-of-the-art translation model consistently yields not only a better alignment quality but also an improved translation quality.",
        "In this paper, we follow this recent effort to narrow the gap between alignment model and translation model to improve translation quality.",
        "More concretely, we focus on the reordering component since we observe that the treatment of reordering remains significantly different when comparing alignment versus translation: the reordering component in state-of-the-art translation models has focused on long-distance reordering, but its counterpart in alignment models has remained focused on local reordering, typically modeling distortion based entirely on positional information.",
        "This leaves most alignment decisions to association-based scores.",
        "Why is employing stronger reordering models more challenging in alignment than in translation?",
        "One answer can be attributed to the fact that alignment points are unobserved in parallel text, thus so are their reorderings.",
        "As such, introducing stronger reordering often further exacerbates the computational complexity to do inference over the model.",
        "Some recent alignment models appeal to external linguistic knowledge, mostly by using monolingual syntactic parses (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Pauls et al., 2010), which at the same time, provides an approximation of the bilingual syntactic divergences that drive the reordering.",
        "To our knowledge, however, this approach has been used mainly to constrain reordering possibilities, or to add to the generalization ability of association-based scores, not to directly model reordering in the context of alignment.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new approach to improving the modeling of reordering in alignment.",
        "Instead of relying on monolingual parses, we condition our reordering model on the behavior of function words and the phrases that surround them.",
        "Function words are the \"syntactic glue\" of sentences, and in fact many syntacticians believe that functional categories, as opposed to substantive categories like noun and verb, are primarily responsible for cross-language syntactic variation (Ouhalla, 1991).",
        "Our reordering model can be seen as offering a reasonable approximation to more fully elaborated bilingual syntactic modeling, and this approximation is also highly practical, as it demands no external knowledge (other than a list of function words) and avoids the practical issues associated with the use of monolingual parses, e.g. whether the monolingual parser is robust enough to produce reliable output for every sentence in training data.",
        "At a glance, our reordering model enumerates the function words on both source and target sides, modeling their reordering relative to their neighboring phrases, their neighboring function words, and the sentence boundaries.",
        "Because the frequency of function words is high, we find that by predicting the reordering of function words accurately, the reordering of the remaining words improves in accuracy as well.",
        "In total, we introduce six sub-models involving function words, and these serve as features in a log linear model.",
        "We train model weights discrimina-tively using Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003), optimizing F-measure.",
        "The parameters of our sub-models are estimated from manually-aligned corpora, leading the reordering model more directly toward reproducing human alignments, rather than maximizing the likelihood of unaligned training data.",
        "This use of manual data for parameter estimation is a reasonable choice because these models depend on a small, fixed number of lexical items that occur frequently in language, hence only small training corpora are required.",
        "In addition, the availability of manually-aligned corpora has been growing steadily.",
        "The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we provide empirical motivation for our approach.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss six submodels based on function word relationships and how their parameters are estimated; these are combined with additional features in Section 4 to produce a single discriminative alignment model.",
        "Section 5 describes a simple decoding algorithm to find the most probable alignment under the combined model, Section 6 describes the training of our discriminative model and Section 7 presents experimental results for the model using this algorithm.",
        "We wrap up in Sections 8 and 9 with a discussion of related work and a summary of our conclusions."

        "1 shows an example of a Chinese-English sentence pair together with correct alignment points.",
        "Predicting the alignment for this particular Chinese-English sentence pair is challenging, since the significantly different syntactic structures of these two languages lead to non-monotone reordering.",
        "For example, an accurate alignment model should account for the fact that prepositional phrases in Chinese appear in a different order than in English, as illustrated by the movement of the phrase \"-^tiff/with North Korea\" from the beginning of the Chinese noun phrase to the end ofthe corresponding English.",

        "The reordering models we describe follow our previous work using function word models for translation (Setiawan et al., 2007; Setiawan et al., 2009).",
        "The core hypothesis in this work is that function words provide robust clues to the reordering patterns ofthe phrases surrounding them.",
        "To make this insight useful for alignment, we develop features that score the alignment configuration of the neighboring phrases of a function word (which functions as an anchor) using two kinds ofinformation: 1) the relative ordering of the phrases with respect to the function word anchor; and 2) the span of the phrases.",
        "This section provides a high level overview of our reordering model, which attempts to leverage this information.",
        "To facilitate subsequent discussions, we introduce the notion of monolingual function word phrase FWi, which consists of the tuple (Yj, Li, Ri), where Yj is the i-th function word and Li,Ri are its left and right neighboring phrases, respectively.",
        "Note that this notion of \"phrase\" is defined only for reordering purposes in our model, and does not necessarily correspond to a linguistic phrase.",
        "We define such phrases on both sides to cover as many nonmonotone reorderings as possible, as suggested by the pilot study.",
        "To denote the side, we append a subscript: FWi;S = (Yi)S, Li S, Ri S) refers to a function word phrase on the source side, and FWi;T = (Yj,T, Li;T, Ri,T) to one on the target side.",
        "In our subsequent discussion, we will mainly use FWi^s, and we will omit subscripts S or T if they are clear from context.",
        "The primary objective of our reordering model is to predict the projection of monolingual function word phrases from one language to the other, inferring bilingual function word phrase pairs FWj,s^T = (Yj,s^T, Lj,s^T, Ri,s^T), which encode the two aforementioned pieces of information.",
        "To infer these phrases, we take a probabilistic approach.",
        "For instance, to estimate the spans of Lis â€“ T, Ris â€“ T, our reordering model assumes that any span to the left of Y^s is a possible Lis and any span to the right of Y^s is a possible R^s, deciding which is most probable via features, rather than committing to particular spans (e.g. as defined by a monolingual text chunker or parser).",
        "We only enforce one criterion on Lis â€“ T and Ris â€“ T : they have to be the maximal alignment blocks satisfying the consistent heuristic (Och and Ney, 2004) that end or start with Yis â€“ T on the source S side respectively.",
        "â–¡",
        "To infer these phrases, we decompose Li s^Tinto (o(Lj,s^T), d(FWj-i,s^T), b((s))); 'similarly, Rj,s-T into (o(Rj,s^T),d(FWj+i,s^T), b((/s)) )).",
        "Taking the decomposition of Li^ â€“ T as a case in point, here o(Lis â€“ T) describes the reordering of the left neighbor Li,s- T with respect to the function word Yis â€“ T, while d^W.i-i^^) and b((s))) probe the span of Lis â€“ T, i.e. whether it goes beyond the preceding function word phrase pairs FW,i,-is â€“ T and up to the beginning-of-sentence marker (s) respectively.",
        "The same definition applies to the decomposition of Ri,s- T, where FWi+\\s-T is the succeeding function word phrase pair and ( /s) is the end-of-sentence marker.",
        "To model o(Li,s- T), o(Ri,s- T), i.e. the reordering of the neighboring phrases of a function word, we employ the orientation model introduced by Setiawan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Formally, this model takes the form of probability distribution Pori(o(Lj,s-T),o(Rj,s-T)\\Yj,s-T), which conditions the reordering on the lexical identity of the function word alignment (but independent of the lexical identity of its neighboring phrases).",
        "In particular, o maps the reordering into one of the following four orientation values (borrowed from Nagata et al.",
        "(2006)) with respect to the function word: Monotone Adjacent (MA), Monotone Gap (MG), Reverse Adjacent (RA) and Reverse Gap (RG).",
        "The Monotone/Reverse distinction indicates whether the projected order follows the original order, while the Adjacent/Gap distinction indicates whether the projections of the function word and the neighboring phrase are adjacent or separated by an intervening phrase.",
        "To model d(FWj-i,s-T), d(FWj+l,s-T), i.e. whether Li,s- T and Ri,s- T extend beyond the neighboring function word phrase pairs, we utilize the pairwise dominance model of Setiawan et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Taking d(FWj-i,s-T) as a case in point, this model takes the form Pdom(d(FWj-i,s-T)\\Yj-i,s-T,Yi,s-T), where d takes one of the following four dominance values: leftFirst, rightFirst, dontCare, or neither.",
        "We will detail the exact formulation of these values in the next subsection.",
        "However, to provide intuition, the value of either leftFirst or neither for d^W^i^^) would suggest that the span of L^s â€“ t doesn't extend to Y^-^^s^; the further distinction between leftFirst and neither concerns with whether the span of Ri-ls â€“ T extends to FWis â€“ T.",
        "To model b((s)), b((/s)), i.e. whether the span of Li,s- T and Ri,s- T extends up to sentence markers, we introduce the borderwise dominance model.",
        "Formally, this model is similar to the pairwise dominance model, except that we use the sentence boundaries as the anchors instead of the neighboring phrase pairs.",
        "This model captures longer distance dependencies compared to the previous two models; in the Chinese-English case, in particular, it is useful to discourage word alignments from crossing clause or sentence boundaries.",
        "The sentence boundary issue is especially important in machine translation (MT) experimentation, since the Chinese side of English-Chinese parallel text often includes long sentences that are composed of several independent clauses joined together; in such cases, words from one clause should be discouraged from aligning to words from other clauses.",
        "In Fig. 1, this model is potentially useful to discourage words from crossing the copula \"J!/is\".",
        "We define each model for all (pairs of) function word phrase pairs, forming features over a set of word alignments (A) between source (S) and target (T) sentence pair, as follows:",
        "where N is the number of function words (of the source side, in the S â€“ T case).",
        "As the bilingual function word phrase pairs are uni-directional, we employ these three models in both directions, i.e. T â€“ S as well as S â€“ T. As a result, there are six reordering models based on function words.",
        "Given FW^i^s^ (and all other FWyi//iys â€“ T), our reordering model has to decompose Li,s- T into (o(Li,s-T), d(FWi-i,s-T), b((s))); and Ri,s-T into (o(Ri,s-T),d(FWi+i,s-T), b((/s)) )) during prediction and parameter estimation.",
        "In prediction mode (described in Section 5), it has to make the decomposition on the current state of alignment, while during parameter estimation, it has to make the same decomposition on the manually-aligned corpora.",
        "Since the process is identical, we proceed with the discussion in the context of parameter estimation, where the decomposition is performed to collect counts to estimate the parameters of our models.",

        "While MERT does not scale to large numbers of features, the scarcity of manually aligned training data also means that models with large numbers of sparse features would be difficult to learn discrimi-natively, so this limitation is somewhat inherent in the problem space.",
        "Additionally, MERT has several advantages that make it particularly useful for our task.",
        "First, we can optimize F-measure of the alignments directly, which has been shown to correlate with translation quality in a downstream system (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b).",
        "Second, we are optimizing the quality of the 1-best alignments under the model.",
        "Since translation pipelines typically use only a single word alignment, this criterion is appropriate.",
        "Finally, and very importantly for us, MERT requires only an approximation of the model's hypothesis space to carry out optimization.",

        "Although the de facto standard, the IBM models do not generalize well in practice: the IBM approach employs a series of reordering models based on the word's position, but reordering depends on syntactic context rather than absolute position in the sentence.",
        "Over the years, there have been many proposals to improve these reordering models, most notably vogel et al.",
        "(1996), which adds a first-order dependency.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of these distortion-based models remains widespread (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Moore, 2004).",
        "Alignment modeling is challenging because it often has to consider a prohibitively large alignment space.",
        "Efforts to constrain the space generally comes from the use of Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997).",
        "Recent proposals that use ITG constraints include (Haghighi et al., 2009; Blunsom et al., 2009) just to name a few.",
        "More recent models have begun to use linguistically-motivated constraints, often in combination with ITG, primarily exploiting monolingual syntactic information (Burkett et al., 2010; Pauls et al., 2010).",
        "Our reordering model is closely related to the model proposed by Zhang and Gildea (2005; 2006; 2007a), with respect to conditioning the reordering predictions on lexical items.",
        "These related models treat their lexical items as latent variables to be estimated from training data, while our model uses a fixed set of lexical items that correspond to the class of function words.",
        "With respect to the focus on function words, our reordering model is closely related to the UALIGN system (Hermjakob, 2009).",

        "Languages exhibit regularities of word order that are preserved when projected to another language.",
        "We use the notion of function words to infer such regularities, resulting in several reordering models that are employed as features in a discriminative alignment model.",
        "In particular, our models predict the reordering of function words by looking at their dependencies with respect to their neighboring phrases, their neighboring function words, and the sentence boundaries.",
        "By capturing such long-distance dependencies, our proposed alignment model contributes to the effort to unify alignment and translation.",
