        "While prepositions do improve with larger factorizations, the improvement beyond edge-based is not significant for Conversion 2.",
        "One hypothesis for why Conversion 1 shows more of an improvement is that the wider scope leads to the semantic head being included; in Conversion 2, the semantic head is chosen as the parent of the preposition, so the wider scope is less necessary."
