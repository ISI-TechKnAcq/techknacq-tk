        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "News substantiate this relevance that is also supported by the spoken language scenario, where most speech summarization systems concentrate on broadcast news (McKeown et al., 2005).",
        "Nevertheless, although the pioneering efforts on summarization go back to the work of Luhn (1958) and Edmundson (1969), it is only after the renaissance of summarization as a research area of great activity – following up on the Dagstuhl Seminar (Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1995) – that the first multi-document news summarization system, SUMMONS (McKeown and Radev, 1995), makes its breakthrough (Radev et al., 2005; Sparck Jones, 2007).",
        "In what concerns speech summarization, the state of affairs is more problematic: news summarization systems appeared later and still focus only on single document summarization (McKeown et al., 2005).",
        "In fact, while text summarization has attained some degree of success (Hovy, 2003; McKeown et al., 2005; Sparck Jones, 2007) due to the considerable body of work, speech summarization still requires further research, both in speech and text analysis, in order to overcome the specific challenges of the task (McKeown et al., 2005; Fu-rui, 2007).",
        "Issues like speech recognition errors, disfluencies, and difficulties in accurately identifying sentence boundaries must be taken into account when summarizing spoken language.",
        "However, if on the one hand, recognition errors seem not to have a considerable impact on the summarization task (Murray et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2005), on the other hand, spoken language summarization systems often explore ways of minimizing that impact (Zechner and Waibel, 2000; Hori et al., 2003; Kikuchietal., 2003).",
        "We argue that by including related solid background information from a different source less prone to this kind of errors (e.g., a textual source) in the summarization process, we are able to reduce the influence of recognition errors on the resulting summary.",
        "To support this argument, we developed a new approach to speech-to-text summarization that combines information from multiple information sources to produce a summary driven by the spoken language document to be summarized.",
        "The idea mimics the natural human behavior, in which information acquired from different sources is used to build a better understanding of a given topic (Wan et al., 2007).",
        "Furthermore, we build on the conjecture that this background information is often used by humans to overcome perception difficulties.",
        "In that sense, one of our goals is also to understand what is expected in a summary: a comprehensive, shorter, text that addresses the same subject of the input source to be summarized (possibly introducing new information); or a text restricted to the information conveyed in the input source.",
        "This work explores the use of phonetic domain information to overcome speech recognition errors and disfluencies.",
        "Instead of using the traditional output of the ASR module, we use the phonetic transliteration of the output and compare it to the phonetic transliteration of solid background information.",
        "This enables the use of text, related to the input source, free from the common speech recognition issues, in further processing.",
        "We use broadcast news as a case study and news stories from online newspapers provide the background information.",
        "Media monitoring systems, used to transcribe and disseminate news, provide an adequate framework to test the proposed method.",
        "This document is organized as follows: section 2 briefly introduces the related work; section 3 presents a characterization of the speech-to-text summarization problem and how we propose to address it; section 4 explicits our use of phonetic domain information, given the previously defined context; the next section describes the case study, including the experimental set up and results; conclusions close the document."

        "On the other hand, speech offers possibilities like the use of prosody and speaker identification to ascertain relevant content.",

        "Sentence extractive methods comprehend, essentially, methods like LSA (Gong and Liu, 2001), Maximal Marginal Relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), and feature-based methods (Edmundson, 1969).",
        "Feature-based methods combine several types of features: current work uses lexical, acoustic/prosodic, structural, and discourse features to summarize documents from domains like broadcast news or meetings (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Murray et al., 2006; Ribeiro and de Matos, 2007).",
        "Even so, spoken language summarization is still quite distant from text summarization in what concerns the use of discourse features, and shallow approaches is what can be found in state-of-the-art work such as the one presented by Maskey and Hirschberg (2005) or Murray et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Sentence compaction methods are based on word removal from the transcription, with recognition confidence scores playing a major role (Hori et al., 2003).",
        "A combination of these two types of methods was developed by Kikuchi et al.",
        "(2003), where summarization is performed in two steps: first, sentence extraction is done through feature combination; second, compaction is done by scoring the words in each sentence and then a dynamic programming technique is applied to select the words that will remain in the sentence to be included in the summary."
