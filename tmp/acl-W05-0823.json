        "During the last decade, statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al., 1993) into phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Similarly, the noisy channel approach has been expanded to a more general maximum entropy approach in which a log-linear combination of multiple models is implemented (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "The SMT approach used in this work implements a log-linear combination of feature functions along with a translation model which is based on bilingual n-grams.",
        "This translation model was developed by de Gispert and Mari˜no (2002), and it differs from the well known phrase-based translation model in two basic issues: first, training data is monotonously segmented into bilingual units; and second, the model considers n-gram probabilities instead of relative frequencies.",
        "This model is described in section 2.",
        "Translation results from the four source languages made available for the shared task (es: Spanish, fr: French, de: German, and fi: Finnish) into English (en) are presented and discussed.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the bilingual n-gram translation model.",
        "Section 3 presents a brief overview of the whole SMT procedure.",
        "Section 4 presents and discusses the shared task results and other interesting experimentation.",
        "Finally, section 5 presents some conclusions and further work."

      "heading": "2 Bilingual N-gram Translation Model",
      "text": [
        "As already mentioned, the translation model used here is based on bilingual n-grams.",
        "It actually constitutes a language model of bilingual units which are referred to as tuples (de Gispert and Mari˜no, 2002).",
        "This model approximates the joint probability between source and target languages by using 3 grams as it is described in the following equation:",
        "where t refers to target, s to source and (t, s)n to the nth tuple of a given bilingual sentence pair.",
        "Tuples are extracted from a word-to-word aligned corpus according to the following two constraints: first, tuple extraction should produce a monotonic segmentation of bilingual sentence pairs; and second, the produced segmentation is maximal in the sense that no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraint (Crego et al., 2004).",
        "According to this, tuple extraction provides a unique segmentation for a given bilingual sentence pair alignment.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this idea with a simple example.",
        "We would like to achieve perfect translations NULL quisieramos lograr traducciones perfectas",
        "Two important issues regarding this translation model must be mentioned.",
        "First, when extracting tuples, some words always appear embedded into tuples containing two or more words, so no translation probability for an independent occurrence of such words exists.",
        "To overcome this problem, the tuple 3-gram model is enhanced by incorporating 1-gram translation probabilities for all the embedded words (de Gispert et al., 2004).",
        "Second, some words linked to NULL end up producing tuples with NULL source sides.",
        "This cannot be allowed since no NULL is expected to occur in a translation input.",
        "This problem is solved by preprocessing alignments before tuple extraction such that any target word that is linked to NULL is attached to either its precedent or its following word."

        "The Euparl data provided for this shared task (Euparl, 2003) was preprocessed for eliminating all sentence pairs with a word ratio larger than 2.4.",
        "As a result of this preprocessing, the number of sentences in each training set was slightly reduced.",
        "However, no significant reduction was produced.",
        "In the case of French, a re-tokenizing procedure was performed in which all apostrophes appearing alone were attached to their corresponding words.",
        "For example, pairs of tokens such as l ’ and qu ’ were reduced to single tokens such as l’ and qu’.",
        "Once the training data was preprocessed, a word-to-word alignment was performed in both directions, source-to-target and target-to-source, by using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).",
        "As an approximation to the most probable alignment, the Viterbi alignment was considered.",
        "Then, the intersection and union of alignment sets in both directions were computed for each training set."

        "The considered translation system implements a total of five feature functions.",
        "The first of these models is the tuple 3-gram model, which was already described in section 2.",
        "Tuples for the translation model were extracted from the union set of alignments as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Once tuples had been extracted, the tuple vocabulary was pruned by using histogram pruning.",
        "The same pruning parameter, which was actually estimated for Spanish-English, was used for the other three language pairs.",
        "After pruning, the tuple 3-gram model was trained by using the SRI Language Modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Finally, the obtained model was enhanced by incorporating 1-gram probabilities for the embedded word tuples, which were extracted from the intersection set of alignments.",
        "Table 1 presents the total number of running words, distinct tokens and tuples, for each of the four training data sets.",
        "The second feature function considered was a target language model.",
        "This feature actually consisted of a word 3-gram model, which was trained from the target side of the bilingual corpus by using the SRI Language Modeling toolkit.",
        "The third feature function was given by a word penalty model.",
        "This function introduces a sentence length penalization in order to compensate the sys",
        "tem preference for short output sentences.",
        "More specifically, the penalization factor was given by the total number of words contained in the translation hypothesis.",
        "Finally, the fourth and fifth feature functions corresponded to two lexicon models based on IBM Model 1 lexical parameters p(t1s) (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These lexicon models were calculated for each tuple according to the following equation:",
        "where s�n and tin are the jth and ith words in the source and target sides of tuple (t, s)n, being J and I the corresponding total number words in each side of it.",
        "The forward lexicon model uses IBM Model 1 parameters obtained from source-to-target alignments, while the backward lexicon model uses parameters obtained from target-to-source alignments."

        "It also allows for three different pruning methods: threshold pruning, histogram pruning, and hypothesis recombination.",
        "For all the results presented in this work the decoder’s monotonic search modality was used.",
        "An optimization tool, which is based on a simplex method (Press et al., 2002), was developed and used for computing log-linear weights for each of the feature functions described above.",
