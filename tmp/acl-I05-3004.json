        "In English, numbers directly modify count nouns, as in ‘two apples’ and ‘five computers’.",

        "However, in Chinese all nouns need numeral classifiers to express quantity1.",
        "When translating from English to Chinese, we may need to choose Chinese classifiers to form noun phrases.",

        "and Ti[wu] V-[pian] f f_G[mianbao] (Chinese) five slices of bread (English) Noun classifer combinations appear with high frequency in Chinese.",
        "There are more than 500 classifiers although fewer than 200 of them are frequently used.",
        "Each classifier can only be",
        "used with certain classes of noun.",
        "Nouns in a class usually have similar properties.",
        "For example, nouns that can be used with the classifier ‘V[gen]’ are: ‘ o*’(straw), ‘ (’(chopstick), ‘TT’(pipe), etc.",
        "All these objects are long and thin.",
        "However, sometimes nouns with similar properties are in different classes.",
        "For example, ‘�’(cow), ‘`’(horse) and ‘`’(lamb) are all livestock, but they associate with different classifiers.",
        "This means that classifier assignment is not totally rule-based but partly idiomatic.",
        "In this paper, we explore the relationship between classifiers and nouns.",
        "We extract a set of features and the corresponding noun-classifier attachments from a corpus and then train SVMs to assign classifers to nouns.",

        "We also computed the confusion matrix for the most commonly misclassified classifiers.",
        "The results are reported in Table 4.",
        "For these experiments we used automatic evaluation (cf. (Paul et al., 2002)).",

        "Our machine learning approach to classifier assignment in Chinese performs better than previously published rule-based approaches and works for bigger data sets.",
        "The noun is clearly the most important feature (experiment 1).",
        "However, we still think ontological features may be useful in classifier assignment, for example for previously unseen nouns, and our experimental results show a trend in this direction, although not a statistically significant one (experiments 2 and 4).",
        "We used the Chinese Treebank for these experiments because it is the only available corpus of parsed Chinese text.",
        "Now that we have isolated the relevant features for this task, we plan to conduct further experiments using larger corpora, such as the Chinese Gigaword (Graf and Chen, 2003).",
        "Our use of ontological features could be improved in several ways.",
        "First, the ontological features we get from HowNet do not fit our purpose well.",
        "For example, the definitions of ‘w’ (cat) and ‘-'’ (cow) are both ‘livestock’; however, they should use different classifiers.",
        "In order to improve the performance of our approach, we need an ontology that correctly groups nouns into classes according to their semantic properties (e.g. type, shape, color, size).",
        "For another knowledge-rich approach, we could use a complex ontology plus a Chinese classifier dictionary that describes the properties of the objects each classifier can modify.",
        "By comparing noun properties and classifier characteristics, classifier assignment could be improved as long as the nouns are in the ontology.",
        "However, there are many idiomatic noun-classifier matchings that can not be categorised by dictionaries.",
        "Therefore, a combination of rule",
        "based and machine-learning approaches seems most promising.",
        "Third, we can classify Chinese classifers into groups and focus on those that modify single objects.",
        "Certain Chinese classifiers can be used before all plural nouns.",
        "Some classifiers specify the container of the objects, for example, ‘-[yi] MT[lanzi] 47%[pingguo]’ (a basket of apples).",
        "The classifier changes when the container changes.",
        "These can be treated differently from sortal and anaphoric classifiers."
