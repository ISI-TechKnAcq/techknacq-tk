        "The availability of large hand-parsed corpora such as the Penn Treebank Project has made high-quality statistical parsers possible.",
        "However, the parsers risk becoming too tailored to these labeled training data that they cannot reliably process sentences from an arbitrary domain.",
        "Thus, while a parser trained on the Wall Street Journal corpus can fairly accurately parse a new Wall Street Journal article, it may not perform as well on a New Yorker article.",
        "To parse sentences from a new domain, one would normally directly induce a new grammar",
        "from that domain, in which the training process would require hand-parsed sentences from the new domain.",
        "Because parsing a large corpus by hand is a labor-intensive task, it would be beneficial to minimize the number of labels needed to induce the new grammar.",
        "We propose to adapt a grammar already trained on an old domain to the new domain.",
        "Adaptation can exploit the structural similarity between the two domains so that fewer labeled data might be needed to update the grammar to reflect the structure of the new domain.",
        "This paper presents a quantitative study comparing direct induction and adaptation under different training conditions.",
        "Our goal is to understand the effect of the amounts and types of labeled data on the training process for both induction strategies.",
        "For example, how much training data need to be hand-labeled?",
        "Must the parse trees for each sentence be fully specified?",
        "Are some linguistic constituents in the parse more informative than others?",
        "To answer these questions, we have performed experiments that compare the parsing qualities of grammars induced under different training conditions using both adaptation and direct induction.",
        "We vary the number of labeled brackets and the linguistic classes of the labeled brackets.",
        "The study is conducted on both a simple Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990) and the more complex Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Our results show that the training examples do not need to be fully parsed for either strategy, but adaptation produces better grammars than direct induction under the conditions of minimally labeled training data.",
        "For instance, the most informative brackets, which label constituents higher up in the parse trees, typically",
        "identifying complex noun phrases and sentential clauses, account for only 17% of all constituents in ATIS and 21% in WSJ.",
        "Trained on this type of label, the adapted grammars parse better than the directly induced grammars and almost as well as those trained on fully labeled data.",
        "Training on ATIS sentences labeled with higher-level constituent brackets, a directly induced grammar parses test sentences with 66% accuracy, whereas an adapted grammar parses with 91% accuracy, which is only 2% lower than the score of a grammar induced from fully labeled training data.",
        "Training on WSJ sentences labeled with higher-level constituent brackets, a directly induced grammar parses with 70% accuracy, whereas an adapted grammar parses with 72% accuracy, which is 6% lower than the score of a grammar induced from fully labeled training data.",
        "That the most informative brackets are higher-level constituents and make up only one-fifth of all the labels in the corpus has two implications.",
        "First, it shows that there is potential reduction of labor for the human annotators.",
        "Although the annotator still must process an entire sentence mentally, the task of identifying higher-level structures such as sentential clauses and complex nouns should be less tedious than to fully specify the complete parse tree for each sentence.",
        "Second, one might speculate the possibilities of replacing human supervision altogether with a partial parser that locates constituent chunks within a sentence.",
        "However, as our results indicate that the most informative constituents are higher-level phrases, the parser would have to identify sentential clauses and complex noun phrases rather than low-level base noun phrases."

        "Grammar induction is the process of inferring the structure of a language by learning from example sentences drawn from the language.",
        "The degree of difficulty in this task depends on three factors.",
        "First, it depends on the amount of supervision provided.",
        "Charniak (1996), for instance, has shown that a grammar can be easily constructed when the examples are fully labeled parse trees.",
        "On the other hand, if the examples consist of raw sentences with no extra structural information, grammar induction is very difficult, even theoretically impossible (Gold, 1967).",
        "One could take a greedy approach such as the well-known Inside-Outside re-estimation algorithm (Baker, 1979), which induces locally optimal grammars by iteratively improving the parameters of the grammar so that the entropy of the training data is minimized.",
        "In practice, however, when trained on unmarked data, the algorithm tends to converge on poor grammar models.",
        "For even a moderately complex domain such as the ATIS corpus, a grammar trained on data with constituent bracketing information produces much better parses than one trained on completely unmarked raw data (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).",
        "Part of our work explores the in-between case, when only some constituent labels are available.",
        "Section 3 defines the different types of annotation we examine.",
        "Second, as supervision decreases, the learning process relies more on search.",
        "The success of the induction depends on the initial parameters of the grammar because a local search strategy may converge to a local minimum.",
        "For finding a good initial parameter set, Lan i and Young (1990) suggested first estimating the probabilities with a set of regular grammar rules.",
        "Their experiments, however, indicated that the main benefit from this type of pretraining is one of runtime efficiency; the improvement in the quality of the induced grammar was minimal.",
        "Briscoe and Waegner (1992) argued that one should first hand-design the grammar to encode some linguistic notions and then use the re-estimation procedure to fine-tune the parameters, substituting the cost of hand-labeled training data with that of hand-coded grammar Our idea of grammar adaptation can be seen as a form of initialization.",
        "It attempts to seed the grammar in a favorable search space by first training it with data from an existing corpus.",
        "Section 4 discusses the induction strategies in more detail.",
        "A third factor that affects the learning process is the complexity of the data.",
        "In their study of parsing the WSJ, Schabes et al.",
        "(1993) have shown that a grammar trained on the Inside-Outside re-estimation algorithm can perform quite well on short simple sentences but falters as the sentence length increases.",

        "It may be beneficial to estimate the informational content of potential training (unmarked) sentences.",
        "The training set should only include sentences that are predicted to have high information values.",
        "Filtering out unhelpful sentences from the training set reduces unnecessary work for the human annotators.",
        "Second, although our experiments show that a sparsely labeled training set is more of an obstacle for the direct induction approach than for the grammar adaptation approach, the direct induction strategy might also benefit from a two stage learning process similar to that used for grammar adaptation.",
        "Instead of training on a different corpus in each stage, the grammar can be trained on a small but fully labeled portion of the corpus in its first stage and the sparsely labeled portion in the second stage.",
        "Finally, higher-level constituents have proved to be the most informative linguistic units.",
        "To relieve humans from labeling any training data, we should consider using partial parsers that can automatically detect complex nouns and sentential clauses."
