        "In this paper we explored several phrase alignment approaches for extracting phrase pairs that are embedded inside comparable sentence pairs.",
        "We used the standard Viterbi phrase alignment, a maximum entropy classifier that works on phrase pairs, and a non-Viterbi PESA alignment in the evaluation process.",
        "The results show that PESA outperforms both the Viterbi approach and the classifier, in both precision and recall.",
        "We plan to extend the PESA framework to use not only lexical features, but other features similar to the ones used in the classifier.",
        "We believe this will further improve the alignment accuracy.",
        "While this paper focuses on comparisons of different phrase alignment approaches in a realistic, yet controlled manner by selecting appropriate comparable sentence pairs for given phrase pairs, future experiments will focus on finding new phrase pairs from comparable corpora and evaluating the potential utility of the extracted data in the context of an end-to-end machine translation system."
