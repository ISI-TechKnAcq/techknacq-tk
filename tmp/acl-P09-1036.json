        "The phrase-based approach is widely adopted in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It segments a source sentence into a sequence of phrases, then translates and reorder these phrases in the target.",
        "In such a process, original phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis, which, however, is broadly used in rule-based approaches.",
        "Since it is not linguistically motivated, original phrase-based decoding might produce ungrammatical or even wrong translations.",
        "Consider the following Chinese fragment with its parse tree:",
        "Ref: established July 11 as Sailing Festival day",
        "The output is generated from a phrase-based system which does not involve any syntactic analysis.",
        "Here we use \"[]\" (straight orientation) and \"()\" (inverted orientation) to denote the common structure of the source fragment and its translation found by the decoder.",
        "We can observe that the decoder inadequately breaks up the second NP phrase and translates the two words \"MW and \"lï\" separately.",
        "However, the parse tree of the source fragment constrains the phrase \"M'M to be translated as a unit.",
        "Without considering syntactic constraints from the parse tree, the decoder makes wrong decisions not only on phrase movement but also on the lexical selection for the multi-meaning word \"l\".",
        "To avert such errors, the decoder can fully respect linguistic structures by only allowing syntactic constituent translations and reorderings.",
        "This, unfortunately, significantly jeopardizes performance (Koehn et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008) because by integrating syntactic constraint into decoding as a hard constraint, it simply prohibits any other useful non-syntactic translations which violate constituent boundaries.",
        "To better leverage syntactic constraint yet still allow non-syntactic translations, Chiang (2005) introduces a count for each hypothesis and accumulates it whenever the hypothesis exactly matches syntactic boundaries on the source side.",
        "On the contrary, Marton and Resnik (2008) and Cherry (2008) accumulate a count whenever hypotheses violate constituent boundaries.",
        "These constituent matching/violation counts are used as a feature in the decoder's log-linear model and their weights are tuned via minimal error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).",
        "In this way, syntactic constraint is integrated into decoding as a soft constraint to enable the decoder to reward hypotheses that respect syntactic analyses or to penalize hypotheses that violate syntactic structures.",
        "Although experiments show that this constituent matching/violation counting feature achieves significant improvements on various language-pairs, one issue is that matching syntactic analysis can not always guarantee a good translation, and violating syntactic structure does not always induce a bad translation.",
        "Marton and Resnik (2008) find that some constituency types favor matching the source parse while others encourage violations.",
        "Therefore it is necessary to integrate more syntactic constraints into phrase translation, not just the constraint of constituent matching/violation.",
        "The other issue is that during decoding we are more concerned with the question of phrase cohesion, i.e. whether the current phrase can be translated as a unit or not within particular syntactic contexts (Fox, 2002), than that of constituent matching/violation.",
        "Phrase cohesion is one of the main reasons that we introduce syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008).",
        "If a source phrase remains contiguous after translation, we refer this type of phrase bracketable, otherwise unbracketable.",
        "It is more desirable to translate a bracketable phrase than an unbracketable one.",
        "In this paper, we propose a syntax-driven bracketing (SDB) model to predict whether a phrase (a sequence of contiguous words) is bracketable or not using rich syntactic constraints.",
        "We parse the source language sentences in the word-aligned training corpus.",
        "According to the word alignments, we define bracketable and unbracketable instances.",
        "For each of these instances, we automatically extract relevant syntactic features from the source parse tree as bracketing evidences.",
        "Then we tune the weights of these features using a maximum entropy (ME) trainer.",
        "In this way, we build two bracketing models: 1) a unary SDB model (UniSDB) which predicts whether an independent phrase is bracketable or not; and 2) a binary SDB model(BiSDB) which predicts whether two neighboring phrases are bracketable.",
        "Similar to previous methods, our SDB model is integrated into the decoder's log-linear model as a feature so that we can inherit the idea of soft constraints.",
        "In contrast to the constituent matching/violation counting (CMVC) (Chiang, 2005; Marton and the following advantages",
        "• The SDB model automatically learns syntactic constraints from training data while the CMVC uses manually defined syntactic constraints: constituency matching/violation.",
        "In our SDB model, each learned syntactic feature from bracketing instances can be considered as a syntactic constraint.",
        "Therefore we can use thousands of syntactic constraints to guide phrase translation.",
        "• The SDB model maintains and protects the strength of the phrase-based approach in a better way than the CMVC does.",
        "It is able to reward non-syntactic translations by assigning an adequate probability to them if these translations are appropriate to particular syntactic contexts on the source side, rather than always punish them.",
        "We test our SDB model against the baseline which doest not use any syntactic constraints on Chinese-to-English translation.",
        "To compare with the CMVC, we also conduct experiments using (Marton and Resnik, 2008)'s XP+.",
        "The XP+ accumulates a count for each hypothesis whenever it violates the boundaries of a constituent with a label from {NP, VP, CP, IP, PP, ADVP, QP, LCP, DNP}.",
        "The XP+ is the best feature among all features that Marton and Resnik use for Chinese-to-English translation.",
        "Our experimental results display that our SDB model achieves a substantial improvement over the baseline and significantly outperforms XP+ according to the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "In addition, our analysis shows further evidences of the performance gain from a different perspective than that of BLEU.",
        "The paper proceeds as follows.",
        "In section 2 we describe how to learn bracketing instances from a training corpus.",
        "In section 3 we elaborate the syntax-driven bracketing model, including feature generation and the integration of the SDB model into phrase-based SMT.",

        "to provide such insights, we introduce a new statistical metric which measures the proportion of syntactic constituents whose boundaries are consistently matched by decoder during translation.",
        "This proportion, which we call consistent constituent matching (CCM) rate , reflects the extent to which the translation output respects the source parse tree.",
        "In order to calculate this rate, we output translation results as well as phrase alignments found by decoders.",
        "Then for each multi-branch constituent c spanning from i to j on the source side, we check the following conditions.",
        "• If its boundaries i and j are aligned to phrase segmentation boundaries found by decoder.",
        "• If all target phrases inside c 's target span are aligned to the source phrases within cand not to the phrases outside c.",
        "If both conditions are satisfied, the constituent cis consistently matched by decoder.",
        "Table 4 shows the consistent constituent matching rates.",
        "Without using any source-side syntactic information, the baseline obtains a low CCM rate of 43.53%, indicating that the baseline decoder violates the source parse tree more than it respects the source structure.",
        "The translation output described in section 1 is actually generated by the baseline decoder, where the second NP phrase boundaries are violated.",
        "By integrating syntactic constraints into decoding, we can see that both Marton and Resnik's XP+ and our SDB model achieve a significantly higher constituent matching rate, suggesting that they are more likely to respect the source structure.",
        "The examples in Table 5 show that the decoder is able to generate better translations if it is faithful to the source parse tree by using syntactic constraints.",
        "We further conducted a deep comparison of translation outputs of BiSDB vs. XP+ with regard to constituent matching and violation.",
        "We found two significant differences that may explain why our BiSDB outperforms XP+.",
        "First, although the overall CCM rate of XP+ is higher than that of BiSDB, BiSDB obtains higher CCM rates for long-span structures than XP+ does, which are shown in Table 6.",
        "Generally speaking, violations of long-span constituents have a more negative impact on performance than short-span violations if these violations are toxic.",
        "This explains why BiSDB achieves relatively higher precision improvements for higher n-grams over XP+, as shown in Table 3.",
        "Second, compared with XP+ that only punishes constituent boundary violations, our SDB model is able to encourage violations if these violations are done on bracketable phrases.",
        "We observed in many cases that by violating constituent boundaries BiSDB produces better translations than XP+ does, which on the contrary matches these boundaries.",
        "Still consider the example shown in section 1.",
        "The following translations are found by XP+ and BiSDB respectively.",
        "XP+ here matches all constituent boundaries while BiSDB violates the PP constituent to translate the non-syntactic phrase \"&ja ;*\".",
        "Table 7 shows more examples.",
        "From these examples, we clearly see that appropriate violations are helpful and even necessary for generating better translations.",
