        "There were two annotation tasks: coindexing anaphors with NP antecedents whenever possible, and classifying the non-coindexable anaphors into categories.",
        "While the coindexing of pronominal anaphors (including the zero pronoun) with their antecedents (or postcedents) was fairly straightforward, the categorization of those pronominal expressions that did not refer to nominal entities in the text raised a some questions which are discussed below.",

        "Consistent with work in English (e.g., (Da-gan and Itai, 1991; Ge et al., 1998; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Morton, 2000)), only third-person pronouns and demonstratives were chosen to be annotated.",
        "The pronouns include reflexives (e.g., 0 E/ \"oneself\"), reciprocals (e.g., �DL/ \"one another\"), and possessives.",
        "For the possessives, the only distinct possessive forms are -A' and (both \"its/his/hers/theirs\"), which are annotated.",
        "Ordinary third-person pronouns in possessive constructions are annotated just as they would be in other contexts.",
        "Unlike English, however, Chinese is a pro-drop language, and there are zero pronouns in addition to the overt ones.",
        "For pro drop, the Bracketing Guidelines for the CTB (Xue and Xia, 2000) specify use of the string \"*pro*\" (small pro) to explicitly denote a zero pronoun in a dropped subject or dropped object position in a parse tree.",
        "Not all empty subject positions in the CTB parses are the result of pro drop, however.",
        "The Bracketing Guidelines specify use of the string \"*PRO*\" (big PRO) when there is a non-overt subject in a clause that is the complement of a control verb, such as \"decide\" (subject control) or */\"cause\" (object control)'.",
        "The Guidelines (Section VIA) also state that *PRO* is to be used as the non-overt subject in \"non-finite clauses,\" typically clauses that are themselves sentential subjects.",
        "Big *PRO* is in complementary distribution with lexicalized constituents2, while *pro* is not so restricted.",
        "The coreference annotation task only deals with the zero pronouns, or small *pro*, in the CTB parses.",
        "The big *PRO*s are ignored, just as they are in a coreference task in English."

        "The approach taken to annotation was therefore twofold.",
        "The first task was to classify each overt pronoun, demonstrative, and small pro either as a coindexable anaphor that was coreferential with a noun phrase that explicitly appeared in the text, or as an anaphor that belonged to one of a set of categories of non-coindexable anaphors.",
        "The second task was to assign indices to the coindexable anaphors and their antecedents.",

        "In more complex appositive constructions, the NP-APP usually was a list, ending in etc., of sample members of a set that was denoted by the head noun.",
        "Since the list was exemplary, rather than definitive, NPs containing such lists were to be annotated only at the parent level.",

        "Unfortunately, adding this category caused more problems than it solved.",

        "The first problem was that just as big PRO can be coindexed (e.g., in subject or object control contexts), in a similar way the *pro* in the \"untensed\" syntactic structures could sometimes be coindexed with an NP.",
        "This presented a problem with consistently annotating such a *pro*: should it be coindexed or marked UNTNS?",
        "The second difficulty with just adding UNTNS to the coreference Guidelines was that both of the categories ANON and UNTNS contained *pro*'s with arbitrary reference, and there was no clean way to differentiate them.",
        "A diagnostic that an ANON *pro* could be substituted by an overt NP was not sufficient.",
        "As a result of these two overlaps (UNTNS that could be coindexed, and arbitrary references in both ANON and UNTNS), there was reliably poor inter-annotator agreement in annotating *pro*'s belonging to these categories.",
        "To simplify the categorization, therefore, the decision was made on the one hand to replace the ANON and the UNTNS categories with the single category ARB (for \"arbitrary\"), and on the other hand to instruct the annotators to always coindex a *pro* when possible.",

Against that negative are the pluses of easier choices for the annotators and better inter-annotator agreement.",
