        "As the DARPA spoken language community moves towards developing useful systems for interactive problem solving, we must explore alternative evaluation procedures that measure whether these systems aid people in solving problems within the task domain.",
        "In this paper, we describe several experiments exploring new evaluation procedures.",
        "To look at end-to-end evaluation, we modified our data collection procedure slightly in order to experiment with several objective task completion measures.",
        "We found that the task completion time is well correlated with the number of queries used.",
        "We also explored log file evaluation, where evaluators were asked to judge the clarity of the query and the correctness of the response based on examination of the log file.",
        "Our results show that seven evaluators were unanimous on more than 80% of the queries, and that at least 6 out of 7 evaluators agreed over 90% of the time.",
        "Finally, we applied these new procedures to compare two systems, one system requiring a complete parse and the other using the more flexible robust parsing mechanism.",
        "We found that these metrics could distinguish between these systems: there were significant differences in ability to complete the task, number of queries required to complete the task, and score (as computed through a log file evaluation) between the robust and the non-robust modes."

        "For the first two years of the DARPA Spoken Language Program, common evaluation in the ATIS domain has been performed solely with the Common Answer Specification (CAS) protocol [4], whereby a system's performance is determined by comparing its output, expressed as a set of database tuples, with one or more predetermined reference answers [1].",
        "The CAS protocol has the advantage that system evaluation can be carried out automatically, once the principles for generating the reference answers have been established and a corpus has been annotated accordingly.",
        "Since direct comparison across systems can be performed relatively easily with this procedure, we have been able to achieve cross fertilization of research ideas, leading to rapid research progress.",
        "Evaluation for which the CAS evaluation gives a misleading assessment of the system's ability to understand.",
        "However, CAS evaluation is not without its share of shortcomings.",
        "One unfortunate outcome of evaluating systems based on answers retrieved from the flight database is that we cannot separately assess the system's understanding of the query from its ability to retrieve the correct information and to conform to the prescribed output format.",
        "In the best case, researchers may end up spending a considerable amount of time worrying about the form and substance of the answer, which has little to do with language understanding.",
        "In the worst case, the results of the evaluation may be down right misleading.",
        "Consider the two examples from the February 1992 test-set shown in Figure 1.",
        "For Query 1, the system misunderstood the phrase \"by six\" as meaning \"before 6:00 a.m.\" Nonetheless, the answer is judged correct, because both the hypothesized and reference answers are the NULL set, i.e., no flights satisfy the set of constraints.",
        "For Query 2, the system found 279 flights, but the correct answer is 278.",
        "The erroneous extra flight is the one connecting flight in the database shared by two airlines, Delta and USAIR.",
        "Another shortcoming of the present evaluation procedure is that it has no place for interactive dialogue.",
        "In a realistic application, the user and the computer are often partners in problem solving, in which the final solution may be best obtained by allowing both sides to take the initiative in the conversation.",
        "Since the hu",
        "man/computer dialogue can vary widely from system to system, it is impossible to use the data collected from one system to evaluate another system without making available the computer's half of the conversation.",
        "Even then, the system being tested becomes an observer analyzing two sides of a conversation rather than a participant.",
        "To be sure, the current evaluation protocol has served the community well.",
        "The refinements made during the last year have significantly improved its ability to provide an objective benchmark.",
        "However, as we continue to press forward in developing useful spoken language systems that can help us solve problems, we must correspondingly expand the battery of evaluation protocols to measure the effectiveness of these systems in accomplishing specific tasks.",
        "At the March 1991 meeting of the SLS Coordinating Committee, a working group was formed with the specific goal of exploring methodologies that will help us evaluate if, and how well, a spoken language system accomplishes its task in the ATIS domain.",
        "The consensus of the working group was that, while we may not have a clear idea about how to evaluate overall system performance, it is appropriate to conduct experiments in order to gain experience.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to describe three experiments conducted at MIT over the past few months related to this issue.",
        "These experiments explored a number of objective and subjective evaluation metrics, and found some of them to be potentially helpful in determining overall system performance and usefulness."

        "In order to carry out end-to-end evaluation, i.e., evaluation of overall task completion effectiveness, we must be able to determine precisely the task being solved, the correct answer(s), and when the subject is done.",

        "We collected data from 29 subjects and analyzed the data from 24 subjects'.",

        "Also plotted are the number of queries that generated a \"no answer\" message.",

        "Table 4 summarizes some of the results comparing the two systems across all scenarios.",
        "For the remainder of this section, we will try to analyze these results and reach some tentative conclusions.",
        "Task Completion The first column of Table 4 shows that the subjects were able to provide an answer in all the scenarios when the system was in robust mode, whereas only 83% of the scenarios were completed in non-robust mode.",
        "Interestingly, a detailed examination of the data shows that, for the 5 cases in the non-robust mode when users gave up, there was never an incorrectly answered query, but the number of unanswered queries was extremely high.",
        "From a problem-solving standpoint, we can tentatively conclude that a system that takes chances and answers more queries seems to be more successful than a more conservative one.",
        "Finding the Correct Solution Our experimental paradigm allowed us to determine automatically, by processing the log files, whether the subject solved the scenario correctly, incorrectly, or not at all.",
        "A much larger percentage of the scenarios were correctly answered with the robust system than with the non-robust system (90% vs. 70%).",
        "Measured in terms of the percent of scenarios correctly solved, the robust system outperformed the non-robust system in all scenarios.",
        "Task Completion Time The task completion time is summarized in the third column of Table 4.",
        "The results are somewhat inconclusive, due to a number of factors.",
        "Although we were interested in assessing how long it took to solve a scenario, we did not inform our subjects of this.",
        "In part, this was because we didn't want to add more stress to the situation.",
        "More than one subject inexplicably cleared the history after having nearly solved the scenario, and then essentially repeated, sometimes verbatim, the same series of questions.",
        "Had they thought there was a time constraint, they probably would not have done this.",
        "We suspect that because subjects were not encouraged to proceed quickly, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the results on time-to-completion.",
        "Another insidious factor was background network traffic and machine load, factors that would contribute to variations in time-to-completion which we did not control for",
        "in these experiments.",
        "The next column of the same table shows the average number of queries for each scenario.",
        "Since these numbers appear to be well correlated with task completion time, they suffer from some of the same deficiencies.",
        "Log File Score In order to measure the number of queries correctly answered by the system, two system developers independently examined each query/answer pair and judged the answer as correct, partially correct, incorrect, or unanswered, based on the evaluation program developed for the logfile evaluation.",
        "The system developers were in complete agreement 92% of the time.",
        "The cases of disagreement were examined to reach a compromise rating.",
        "This provided a quick and reasonably accurate way to assess whether the subjects received the information they asked for.",
        "The percentages of queries correctly answered, incorrectly answered, and unanswered, and the resulting DARPA score (i.e., % correct - % incorrect) are shown in the last four columns of Table 4.",
        "Although not shown in Table 4, the overall ratio of correctly answered queries to those producing no answer was an order of magnitude higher for the robust parser (148:13) than for the non-robust parser (118:125).",
        "This was associated with an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of incorrect answers: 32 vs. 3 for the non-robust parser.",
        "However, the percentage of \"no an-swer\" queries seemed to be more critical in determining whether a subject succeeded with a scenario than the percentage of incorrect queries.",
        "Debriefing Questionnaire Each subject received a debriefing questionnaire, which included a question asking for a comparison of the two systems used.",
        "Unfortunately, data were not obtained from the first five subjects.",
        "Of the ten subjects that responded, five preferred the robust system, one preferred the non-robust system, and the remaining ones expressed no preference.",
        "Difficulty of Scenarios There was considerable variability among the scenarios in terms of difficulty.",
        "Scenario 4 turned out to be by far the most difficult one to solve, with only a little over half of the sessions being successfully completed'.",
        "Subjects were asked to \"choose a date within the next week\" and to be sure that the restrictions on their fare were acceptable.",
        "We intentionally did not expand the system to understand the phrase \"within the next week\" to mean \"no seven-day advance purchase requirement,\" but instead required the user to determine that information through some other means.",
        "Also in Scenario 4, there were no available first class fares that would exactly cover two coach class fares.",
        "Scenarios 2 and 4 were intended to be more difficult than 1 and 3, and indeed they collectively had a substantially lower percentage of correct query answers than the other two scenarios, reflecting the fact that subjects were groping for ways to ask for information that the system would be able to interpret.",
        "There was a wide variation across subjects in their ability to solve a given scenario, and in fact, subjects deviated substantially from our expectations.",
        "Several subjects did not read the instructions carefully and ignored or misinterpreted key restrictions in the scenario.",
        "For instance, one subject thought the \"within the next week\" requirement in Scenario 4 meant that he should return within a week of his departure.",
        "Some subjects had a weak knowledge of air travel; one subject assumed that the return trip would be on the same flight as the forward leg, an assumption which caused considerable confusion for the system.",
        "The full parser and robust parser showed different strengths and weaknesses in specific scenarios.",
        "For example, in Scenario 3, the full parser often could not parse the expression \"Boeing 757\", but the robust parser had no trouble.",
        "This accounts in part for the large \"win\" of the robust parser in this scenario.",
        "Conversely, in Scenario 4, the robust parser misinterpreted expressions of the type \"about two hundred dollars\", treating \"about two\" as a time expression.",
        "This led, the conversation badly astray in these cases, and perhaps accounts for the",
        "fact that subjects took more time solving the scenario in robust mode.",
        "The lesson here is that different scenarios may find different holes in the systems under comparison, thus making the comparison extremely sensitive to the exact choice and wording of the scenarios.",
        "Performance Comparison The robust parser performed better than the non-robust parser on all measures for all scenarios except in Scenario 4.",
        "In Scenario 4, the percentage of sessions resulting in a correct solution favored robust parsing by a large margin (71% vs. 38%), but the robust parser had a longer time to completion and more queries to completion than the non-robust system, as well as a worse DARPA score (51% to 49%).",
        "The robust parser gave a greater percentage of correct answers (71% vs. 51%), but its incorrect answers were significant enough (22% to 0%) to reverse the outcome for the DARPA score.",
        "Thus DARPA score seems to be correlated with time to completion, but percent of correct answers seems to be correlated with getting a correct solution.",
        "We feel that the data for Scenario 4, when used to make comparisons between the robust and non-robust parser, are anomalous for several reasons.",
        "The scenario itself confused subjects, some of whom incorrectly assumed that the correct fare was one which was exactly one-half of the first class fare.",
        "Furthermore, fare restrictions are not as familiar to subjects as we previously assumed, leading to lengthy interactions with the system.",
        "These difficulties led to differences in performance across systems that we feel are not necessarily linked directly to the systems themselves but rather to the nature of the scenario being solved.",
        "In summary, our data show the following salient trends:",
        "1.",
        "Subjects were always able to complete the scenario for the robust system.",

        "Percent of correctly answered queries followed the same trend as completion time and number of overall queries; these may provide a rough measure of task difficulty.",

        "In addition, these metrics appear to be correlated.",
        "To assess correctness of system response, we have shown that evaluators can produce better than 90% agreement evaluating the correctness of response based on examination of query/answer pairs from the log file.",
        "We have implemented an interactive tool to support this evaluation, and have used it in two separate experiments.",
        "Finally, we demonstrated the utility of these metrics in characterizing two systems.",
        "There was good correspondence between how effective the system was in helping the user arrive at a correct answer for a given task, and metrics such as time to task completion, number of queries, and percent of correctly answered queries (based on log file evaluation).",
        "These metrics also indicated that system behavior may not be uniform over a range of scenarios - the robust parsing system performed better on three scenarios, but had a worse DARPA score on the fourth (and probably most difficult) scenario.",
        "Based on these experiments, we believe that these metrics provide the basis for evaluating spoken language systems in a realistic interactive problem solving context."
