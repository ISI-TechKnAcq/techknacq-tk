        "As a result, often no substructures corresponding to partial PTB constituents are extracted to form translation rules.",
        "Syntax translation models acquired by composing treebank grammar rules assume that long rewrites are not decomposable into smaller steps.",
        "This effectively restricts the generalization power of the induced model.",
        "For example, suppose we have an xRs (Knight and Graehl, 2004) rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates the Chinese phrase russia minister viktor-chernomyrdin into an English NPB tree fragment yielding an English phrase.",

        "We unfortunately cannot do this because R1 and R2 are not further decomposable and their substructures cannot be re-used.",
        "The requirement that all translation rules have exactly one root node does not enable us to use the translation of viktor-chernomyrdin in any other contexts than those seen in the training corpus.",
        "A solution to overcome this problem is to right-binarize the left-hand side (LHS) (or the English-side) tree of R1 such that we can decompose R1 into R3 and R4 by factoring NNP(viktor) NNP(chernomyrdin) out as R4 according to the word alignments; and left-binarize the LHS ofR2 by introducing a new tree node that collapses the two NNP's, so as to generalize this rule, getting rule R5and rule R6.",
        "We also need to consistently syntact-ify the root labels of R4 and the new frontier label of R6 such that these two rules can be composed.",
        "Since labeling is not a concern of this paper, we simply label new nodes with X-bar where X here is the parent label.",

        "The EM-binarization performs the best among all the restructuring methods, leading to 1.0 BLEU point improvement.",
        "We also computed the bootstrap p-values (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005) for the pairwise BLEU comparison between the baseline system and any of the system trained from bina-rized trees.",
        "The significance test shows that the EM binarization result is statistically significant better than the baseline system (p > 0.005), even though the baseline is already quite strong.",
        "To our best knowledge, 37.94 is the highest BLEU score on this test set to date.",
        "Also as shown in Table 1, the grammars trained from the binarized training trees are almost two times of the grammar size with no binarization.",
        "The extra rules are substructures factored out by these bi-narization methods.",
        "How many more substructures (or translation rules) can be acquired is partially determined by how many more admissible nodes each binarization method can factorize, since rules are extractable only from admissible tree nodes.",
        "According to Table 1, binarization methods significantly increase the number of admissible nodes in the training trees.",
        "The EM binarization makes available the largest",
        "Table 1: Translation performance, grammar size and # admissible nodes versus binarization algorithms.",
        "BLEU scores are for mixed-cased and detokenized translations, as we usually do for NIST MT evaluations.",
        "Table 2: Binarization bias learned by EM.",
        "number of admissible nodes, and thus results in the most rules.",
        "The EM binarization factorizes more admissible nodes because it mixes both left and right binariza-tions in the same tree.",
        "We computed the binarization biases learned by the EM algorithm for each nonterminal from the binarization forest ofheaded-parallel binarizations of the training trees, getting the statistics in Table 2.",
        "Of course, the binarization bias chosen by left-/right-binarization methods would be 100% deterministic.",
        "One noticeable message from Table 2 is that most of the categories are actually biased toward left-binarization, although our motivating example in our introduction section is for NPB, which needed right binarization.",
        "The main reason might be that the head sub-constituents of most categories tend to be on the left, but according to the performance comparison between head binarization and EM binarization, head binarization does not suffice because we still need to choose the binarization between left and right if they both are head binariza-tions."

        "In this paper, we not only studied the impact of simple tree binarization algorithms on the performance of end-to-end syntax-based MT, but also proposed binarization methods that mix more than one simple binarization in the binarization of the same parse tree.",
        "Binarizing a tree node whether to the left or to the right was learned by employing the EM algorithm on a set of alternative binarizations and by choosing the Viterbi one.",
        "The EM binarization method is informed by word alignments such that unnecessary new tree nodes will not be \"blindly\" introduced.",
        "To our best knowledge, our research is the first work that aims to generalize a syntax-based translation model by restructuring and achieves significant improvement on a strong baseline.",
        "Our work differs from traditional work on binarization of synchronous grammars in that we are not concerned with the equivalence of the binarized grammar to the original grammar, but intend to generalize the original grammar via restructuring of the training parse trees to improve translation performance."
