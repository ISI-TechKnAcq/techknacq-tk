        "However, the PTB deals with text only at the sentence level: with the demand for more powerful NLP applications comes a need for greater richness in annotation.",
        "At the sentence level, Penn Propbank is adding predicate-argument annotation to sentences in PTB (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).",
        "At the discourse-level are efforts to produce corpora annotated with rhetorical relations (Carlson et al., 2003).",
        "This paper describes a more basic discourse-level annotation project – the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) – that aims to produce a large-scale corpus in which discourse connectives are annotated, along with their arguments.",
        "There have been several approaches to describing discourse in terms of discourse relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Asher and Lascarides, 1998; Polanyi and van den Berg, 1996).",
        "In these approaches, the additional meaning the discourse contributes beyond the sentence derives from discourse relations.",
        "Specification of the discourse relations for a discourse thus constitutes a description of a certain level of discourse structure.",
        "Rather than starting from (abstract) discourse relations, we describe an approach to annotating a large-scale corpus in terms of a more basic characterisation of discourse structure in terms of discourse connectives and their arguments.",

        "Section 4).",
        "This is not surprising, given that the task resembles that of annotating verbs and their arguments at the sentence level (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).",
        "In fact, we use a fine-grained, lexically grounded annotation in which argument labels are specific to the dis-1In the PDTB annotations, we have deliberately adopted a policy to make the annotations independent of the DLTAG framework for two reasons: (1) to make the annotated corpus widely useful to researchers working in different frameworks and (2) to make the annotators’ task easier, thereby increasing interannotator reliability.",
        "2However, the approaches in Gardent (1997), Schilder (1997), and Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) are different in two ways: a) the process by which discourse derives compositional aspects of meaning is considered entirely separate from how clauses do so, and b) only two mechanisms are used for deriving discourse semantics – compositional semantics and inference.",

        "In contrast, a recent attempt (Carlson et al., 2003) at using RST-type relations for annotating a much smaller corpus has already revealed difficulties involved in reliably annotating more abstract discourse relations.",

        "For the complete interpretation of these connectives, their other argument needs to be recovered.",
        "The crucial contribution of this framework to the design of the current project is what can be seen as a bottom-up approach to discourse structure.",
        "Specifically, instead of appealing to an abstract (and arbitrary) set of discourse relations whose identification involves confounding multiple sources of discourse meaning, we start with the annotation of discourse connectives and their arguments, thus exposing a clearly defined level of discourse representation."

        "The annotation tool WordFreak4 is used to identify all instances of the given connective in the corpus, and these are then annotated independently and manually by four annotators.",
        "This way, the annotators quickly gain experience with that connective and develop a better understanding of its predicate-argument characteristics.",
        "Similarly, for the annotation of implicit connectives, all instances (as specified in the guidelines, see Section 3.2) are identified one file at a time.",

        "We also computed agreement using a second more conservative diagnostic in which we took the class of tokens as the total number of connective tokens (2717) so that the ARG1 and ARG2 annotations for each connective were treated together as part of the same token.",
        "Here again, we recorded agreement using the exact match measure.",
        "That is, for any connective token, agreement was recorded as 1 when both annotators made identical textual selections for the annotation of both arguments and 0 when the annotators made non-identical selections for any one or both arguments.",
        "We achieved 82.8% agreement (2249/2717 tokens) on the annotations for this class.",
        "Table 2 gives the distribution of the agreements by connective.",
        "The table shows relatively lower agreements when compared with the first diagnostic, for both subordinating conjunctions (86%) as well as adverbials (57%).",
        "However, this difference is understandable since the token class as defined for this diagnostic yields a stricter measure of agreement.",
        "We classified disagreements into 4 major types.",
        "The result of classifying the 534 disagreements from Diagnostic 1 (Table 1) is given in Table 3.",
        "The third column gives the percent of the total disagreements for each type.",
        "The majority of disagreements (79%) were due to Partial Overlap, which subsumes the categories Higher Verb, Dependent Clause, Parenthetical and Other.",
        "Partial Overlap means that there was partial overlap in the annotations selected by the two annotators.",
        "Higher verb includes tokens where one of the annotators included the governing predicate for the clause marked by both annotators.",
        "The higher clause occurred on the left or right periphery of the lower clause.",
        "Dependent Clause includes tokens where one of the annotators included extra clausal material that is syntactically dependent on the clause that was selected by both, and that occurs on the left or right periphery of the common text.",
        "Parenthetical means that one of the annotators included a medial parentheti cal, while the other did not.",
        "The intervening text could be the main as well as the dependent clause.",
        "An example is provided below: (16) Bankers said [warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive] because [they give foreign investors], wary of volatility in the colony’s stock market, [an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk].",
        "(17) Bankers said [warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive] because [they give foreign investors, wary of volatility in the colony’s stock market, an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk].",
        "Other included tokens with partial overlap between annotations, but in addition included a combination of more than type, such as higher verb+dependent clause.",
        "Note that disagreements that contain a partial overlap could be counted as agreeing tokens if we relaxed the more conservative exact match measure to a partial match measure.",
        "Our subjective view was that in several cases, the “extra” textual material, especially those fitting the dependent clause and parenthetical category did not make any significant semantic contribution in terms of their inclusion or exclusion in the argument.",
        "With the partial match measure, excluding these cases reduces the disagreements to half the given number, giving us 94.5% agreement overall.",
        "The No Overlap tokens were cases of true disagreement in that there was no overlap in the annotations selected by the annotators.",
        "These tokens constituted 5.6% of the disagreements.",
        "Examples (18) and (19) shows the two annotations for a token in which there was no overlap in the ARG1 annotation.",
        "Missing Annotations also constituted a substantial proportion of the disagreements (13.5%) and was used for tokens where the annotation was missing for one annotator.",
        "Note that these don’t really count as disagreement, since all connectives are pre-theoretically assumed to require two arguments.",
        "Unresolved includes tokens which have introduced new issues for the annotation guidelines and cannot be resolved at this time.",
        "These include issues such as how to treat comparatives, certain types of adjunct clauses, certain types of nominalizations etc.",
        "(18) [The word ”death” cannot be escaped entirely by the industry], but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, [preferring to talk about ”savings” and ”investment”] instead.",

        "As a preliminary step in analyzing agreement on the type of explicit connective provided by the annotators in place of an implicit connective, we considered 5 groups of connectives conveying : a) additional information (e.g., ‘furthermore’, ‘in addition’) b) cause-effect relations (e.g., ‘because’, ‘as a result’), c) temporal relations (e.g., ‘then’, ‘simultaneously’), d) contrastive relations (e.g., ‘however’, ‘although’), and e) restatement or summarization (e.g., ‘in other words’, ‘in sum’).",
