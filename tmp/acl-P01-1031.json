        "Clarification ellipsis (CE), nonsentential elliptical queries such as (1a(i),(ii)) are commonplace in human conversation.",
        "Two common readings/understandings of CE are exemplified in (1b,c): the clausal reading is commonly used simply to confirm the content of a particular subutterance.",
        "The main function of the constituent reading is to elicit an alternative description or ostension to the content (referent or predicate etc) intended by the original speaker of the reprised sub-utterance.",

        "The issue of whether CE involves an ambiguity or is simply vague is an important one.",
        "1,2 Clearly, pragmatic reasoning plays an important role in understanding CEs.",
        "Some considerations do, nonetheless, favour the existence of an ambiguity.",
        "First, the BNC provides numerous examples of misunderstandings concerning CE interpretation,3 where a speaker intends one reading, is misunderstood, and clarifies his original interpretation:",

        "A: Have a laugh and joke with Dick./ B: Dick?/A: Have a laugh and joke with Dick./B: Who’s Dick?",
        "More crucially, the clausal and constituent readings involve distinct syntactic and phonological parallelism conditions.",
        "The constituent reading seems to actually require phonological identity.",
        "With the resolution associated with clausal readings, there is no such requirement.",
        "However, partial syntactic parallelism does obtain: an XP used to clarify an antecedent sub-utterance ✁✂ must match ul categorially, though there is no requirement ofphonological identity:",

        "These presuppose no sophisticated linguistic analysis.",
        "However, it is not usual for a system to be able to process CEs produced by the user.",
        "It would be a great advantage in negotiative dialogues, where, for example, the system and the user might be discussing several options and the system may make alternative suggestions, for a system to be able to recognize and interpret a CE.",
        "Consider the following (constructed) dialogue in the route-planning domain:",
        "(4) Sys: Would you like to make that trip via Malvern?",
        "User: Malvern?",
        "At this point the system has to consider a number of possible intepretations for the user’s utterance all of which involve recognizing that this is a clarification request concerning the system’s last utterance.",
        "Appropriate responses might be (5a-c); the system should definitely not say (5d), as it might if it does not recognize that the user is trying to clarify its previous utterance.",
        "(5) a.",
        "Yes, Malvern b. Malvern – MALVERN c. Going via Malvern is the quickest route d. So, you would like to make that trip via Malvern instead of Malvern?",
        "In this paper we examine the interpretation of CEs.",
        "CE is a singularly complex ellipsis/anaphoric phenomenon which cannot be handled by standard techniques such as first order unification (as anaphora often is) or by higher order unification (HOU) on logical forms (see e.g. (Pulman, 1997)).",
        "For a start, in order to capture the syntactic and phonological parallelism exemplified in (3), logical forms are simply insufficient.",
        "Moreover, although an HOU account could, given a theory of dialogue that structures context appropriately, generate the clausal reading, the constituent reading cannot be so generated.",
        "Clark (e.g. (Clark, 1996)) initiated work on the grounding of an utterance (for computational and formal work see e.g. (Traum, 1994; Poesio and Traum, 1997)).",
        "However, existing work, while spelling out in great detail what updates arise in an IS as a result of grounding, do not offer a characterization of the clarification possibilities spawned by a given utterance.",
        "A sketch of such a characterization is provided in this paper.",
        "On the basis of this we offer an analysis of CE, integrated into a large existing grammar framework, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (specifically the version developed in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)).",
        "We start by informally describing the grounding/clarification processes and the representations on which they operate.",
        "We then provide the requisite background on HPSG and on the KOS framework (Ginzburg, 1996; Bohlin et al., 1999), in which our analysis of ISs is couched.",

        "We start by offering an informal description of how an utterance u such as (6) can get grounded or spawn a clarification by an addressee B:",
        "(6) A: Did Bo leave?",
        "A is attempting to convey to B her question whether the property she has referred to with her utterance of leave holds of the person she has referred to with the name Bo.",
        "B is required to try and find values for these references.",
        "Finding values is, with an important caveat, a necessary condition for B to ground A’s utterance, thereby signalling that its content has been integrated in B’s IS .4 Modelling this condition for successful grounding provides one obvious constraint on the representation of utterance types: such a representation must involve a function from or A-abstract over a set of certain parameters (the contextual parameters) to contents.",
        "This much is familiar already from early work on context dependence by (Montague, 1974) et seq.",
        "What happens when B cannot or is at least uncertain as to how he should instantiate in his IS a contextual '?",
        "In such a case B needs to do at least parameter the following: (1) perform a partial update of the existing context with the successfully processed components of the utterance (2) pose a clarification question that involves reference to the sub-utterance ui from which i emanates.",
        "Since the original speaker, A, can coherently integrate a clarification question once she hears it, it follows that, for a given utterance, there is a predictable range of < partial updates + consequent clarification questions>.",
        "These we take to be specified by a set of coercion operations on utterance representations.5 Indeed we assume that a component of dialogue competence is knowledge of these coercion operations.",
        "CE gives us some indication concerning both the input and required output of these operations.",
        "One such operation, which we will refer to as parameter identification, essentially involves as output a question paraphrasable as what is the intended reference of sub-utterance ui?.",
        "The partially updated context in which such a clarification takes place is such that simply repeating the segmental phonology of ui using rising intonation enables that question to be expressed.",
        "Another existent coercion operation is one which we will refer to as parameter focussing.",
        "This involves a (partially updated) context in which the issue under discussion is a question that arises by instantiating all contextual parameters except for i and abstracting over i.",
        "In such a context, one",
        "can confirm that a gets the value B suspects it has by uttering with rising intonation any apparently co-referential phrase whose syntactic category is identical to uI’s.",
        "From this discussion, it becomes clear that coercion operations (and by extension the grounding process) cannot be defined simply on meanings.",
        "Rather, given the syntactic and phonological parallelism encoded in clarification contexts, these operations need to be defined on representations that encode in parallel for each sub-utterance down to the word level phonological, syntactic, semantic, and contextual information.",
        "With some minor modifications, signs as conceived in HPSG are exactly such a representational format and, hence, we will use them to define coercion operations.6 More precisely, given that an addressee might not be able to come up with a unique or a complete parse, due to lexical ignorance or a noisy environment, we need to utilize some ‘underspecified’ entity (see e.g. (Mil-ward, 2000)).",
        "For simplicity we will use descriptions of signs.",
        "An example of the format for signs we employ is given in (7):7 6W e make two minor modifications to the version of HPSG described in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)).",
        "First, we revamp the existing treatment of the feature C-INDICES.",
        "This will now encode the entire inventory of contextual parameters of an utterance (proper names, deictic pronouns, indexicals) not merely information about speaker/hearer/utterancetime, as standardly.",
        "Indeed, in principle, relation names should also be included, since they vary with context and are subject to clarification as well.",
        "Such a step involves a significant change to how argument roles are handled in existing HPSG.",
        "Hence, we do not make such a move here.",
        "This modification of C-INDICES will allow signs to play a role akin to the role associated with ‘meanings’, i.e. to function as abstracts with roles that need to be instantiated.",
        "The second modification we make concerns the encoding ofphrasal constituency.",
        "Standardly, the feature DTRS is used to encode immediate phrasal constituency.",
        "To facilitate statement of coercion operations, we need access to all phrasal constituents – given that a contextual parameter emanating from deeply embedding constituents are as clarifiable as immediate constituents.",
        "We posit a set valued feature CONSTIT(UENT)S whose value is the set of all constituents immediate or otherwise of a given sign (Cf. the mother-daughter predicates used in (Gregory and Lappin, 1999).)",
        "In fact, having posited CONSTITS one could eliminate DTRS: this by making the value of CONSTITS be a set of sets whose first level elements are the immediate constituents.",
        "For current purposes, we stick with tradition and tolerate the redundancy of both DTRS and CONSTITS.",
        "7Within the phrasal type system of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) root-cl constitutes the ‘start’ symbol of the grammar.",
        "In particular, phrases of this type have as their content an illocutionary operator embedding the appropriate semantic",
        "Before we can explain how these representations can feature in dialogue reasoning and the resolution of CE, we need to sketch briefly the approach to dialogue ellipsis that we assume."
