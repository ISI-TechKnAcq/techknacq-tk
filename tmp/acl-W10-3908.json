        "The web has popularized information access.",
        "As a consequence, the information put on the web evolved, expanding from mainly technical documents in one language (English) to topics concerning nearly any aspect of life in many languages.",
        "For this reason it cannot be expected anymore that all web users speak English.",
        "Yet users speaking only one of the minority languages will be penalized, finding only a small fraction of web content accessible.",
        "Hence they can make only very limited use of what is available.",
        "In order to increase information access independently of the users' mother tongue, automatic translation is desirable.",
        "Recognizing this need, Google, among others, is providing free machine translation services for any pair of currently 50 languages/ However, with 6800 living languages, of which 600 also use a written form, offering comprehensive translation services remains a challenge.",
        "The statistical approach to machine translation (SMT), as adopted by Google, relies on parallel corpora, i.e. large collections of existing translations.",
        "But it is a daunting task trying to acquire parallel corpora for all possible language pairs.",
        "Therefore, it appears that for some languages Google has combined SMT with an inter-lingua approach.",
        "This allows optimal exploitation of languages for which parallel corpora are easily obtained.",
        "These languages are then used as pivots.",
        "Note that in phrase-based SMT an inter-lingua approach may operate at the level of the phrase table, which facilitates matters while speeding up the process.",
        "At the downside it must be noted that a phrase table derived via a pivot language is generally of lower quality than a phrase table directly compiled from parallel texts (provided the corpus size is similar).",
        "Hence, just as for other interlingua approaches, translation quality is severely compromised.",
        "An alternative approach that has been suggested is to try to generate the required dictionaries from other sources than parallel corpora.",
        "Bear in mind that statistical machine translation requires a language model and a translation model.",
        "To generate the language model only monolingual corpora of the target language are required which, for example, can be acquired from the web.",
        "If only few such documents exist, one may well conclude that there is probably no real need",
        "http://www.google.de/language_tools?hl=de as of April 22, 2010.",
        "lingual corpus without necessarily requiring dictionaries, although, as will be shown, a dictionary can still be useful for improving the results.",
        "Our approach is based on the observation that for various reasons monolingual corpora typically contain many foreign words (for example citations).",
        "Relying on standard newsticker texts, we will show that their cooccurrence-based associations can be successfully used to identify word translations.",
        "required to generate a translation model.",
        "But the purpose of the translation model is in essence thence comparable cor-resource than paralfor translation involving this particular language.",
        "So the main bottleneck are the parallel corpora creation of a bilingual dictionary, be it a dictionary of individual words or a dictionary of phrases.",
        "For this reason, if we can find other ways to generate dictionaries for lesser used languages, this will be beneficial not only for the users of these languages but also for the solution of the overall problem of machine translation.",
        "One approach is to mine parallel sentences from comparable corpora.",
        "Roughly speaking, this can be done by automatically translating a corpus from one language (source language) to another (target language), and then searching in a large corpus of the target language for sentences similar to the translations.",
        "The advantage of this procedure is that the sentences retrieved this way are correct sentences as they were produced by humans, whereas the sentences translated by a machine tend to be garbled and of lower quality.",
        "However, the big problem with this approach is to ensure that the retrieved sentence pairs are indeed translations of each other.",
        "While there is no perfect solution to this problem, several studies have shown that such data can be useful for building or supplementing translation models in SMT (see e. g. Munteanu & Marcu, 2005; Wu & Fung, 2005).",
        "Another approach for exploiting comparable corpora in dictionary generation is based on the observation that word co-occurrence patterns between languages tend to be similar (Fung & McKeown, 1997; Rapp, 1995; Chiao et al., 2004).",
        "If, for example, two words X and Y co-occur more often than expected by chance in a corpus of language A, then their translated equivalents should also co-occur more frequently than expected in a corpus of proposed, e.g. emphasizing aspects of corpus selection or expanding it to collocations or short phrases (Babych et al., 2007).",
        "What is common to these studies is that they consider the source and the target language as two distinct semantic spaces, without any links at the beginning.",
        "Therefore, in order to connect the two, a base dictionary is required, and the purpose of the system is to expand this base dictionary.",
        "Building a dictionary from scratch is not possible this way or at least computationally unfeasible (see Rapp, 1995).",
        "Whether the assumption of two completely distinct semantic spaces is realistic remains an open issue.",
        "Are separate lexical networks really a reasonable model for the processing of different languages by people?",
        "One could say this is a plausible model, assuming a person lived for some years in one country, and then for some more years in another country, assuming further that this person never looked at a dictionary or another multilingual document and never communicated with a person mixing both languages.",
        "mediators.",
        "That the extrapolation to more abstract notions is possible has been claimed by can easily understand and",
        "So, although the above scenario is possible, we do not think that it is a typical one for our modern times.",
        "There are certainly good reasons why there are so many language courses, and why there is such an abundance of dictionaries.",
        "It is a matter of commonsense that the person trying to acquire a new language will look at a multilingual dictionary.",
        "He or she will also communicate with other persons who mix languages, for example, relatives, other people from the comlanguage B.",
        "A great number of variants of this approach has been",
        "It is known that this can work.",
        "The reason is probably the following: Many words of the basic dictionary assumed above correspond to items of the physical world.",
        "These items generally have",
        "In other words, an important challenge is the generation of dictionaries.",
        "Sipora are a far more common lel corpora, attempts to exploit them for dictionary construction have received considerable attention recently.",
        "Still, although persons proceeding this way after some years, even think in each of the two languages, experience shows that they tend to have some difficulties when making translations, especially literal translations.",
        "here is also the approach of identifying orthographically similar words (Koehn & Knight, 2002) which does not even require a corpus as simple word lists will suffice.",
        "However, this approach is promising only for closely related languages but appears to have limited scope otherwise.",
        "For this reason we will not further discuss it here.",
        "spoke such",
        "If we agree on this, our next step could be to acquire transcripts of language teaching classes with bilingual teachers and try to exploit these for dictionary generation.",
        "Since obtaining such transcripts in large enough quantities should be much more difficult than obtaining parallel corpora, this approach will probably not solve the data acquisition bottleneck which is the practical problem we were about to solve in the first place.",
        "The current study is therefore based on newsticker texts which is a text type very similar to standard newspaper texts.",
        "At least for some lan-",
        "On the other hand, as this study suggests a (to our knowledge) novel approach, we consider it important to use a corpus that is generally known and available, and which has not been compiled with this particular purpose in mind.",
        "Only this way our results can convincingly give an idea concerning the baseline performance of the suggested algorithm.",
        "At this stage we consider this more important than optimizing results by compiling corpora specifically suited for the purpose, even though this will be a logical next step."

        "Table 1 shows a few sample entries of the resulting list of word equations which were used for evaluating our approach.",
        "We should mention that the term word equation is a bit problematic, as most words tend to be ambiguous, and ambiguities tend to vary with language.",

        "For this reason, clarity has priority over performance.",
        "2) The number of translations listed in a dictionary typically depends on the size of the resource.",
        "Hence, there is no absolute difference between correct and incorrect translations.",
        "Rather, we need to set a threshold somewhere, and truncating after the first word listed is arguably the clearest and simplest way of doing so.",
        "3) This is the main reason.",
        "We want to extend our approach to the multilingual case by (simultaneously) looking at several source languages.",
        "Given the fact that each language tends to have its own (i.e. idiosyncratic) ambiguities, we are already satisfied if words from the various source languages have the same main translation.",

        "The solution consists in considering several source languages concurrently.",
        "Suppose that rather than starting from scratch we use existing dictionaries for various languages.",
        "In this case we can easily generate word equations such as the ones shown in Table 1.",
        "We do this by considering as a single item all words appearing in a given row (excluding the target language word), and by computing the associations to this aggregated artificial unit.",

        "do not occur in the corpus, as long as the c) The homograph trap",
        "By this we mean that a word form from the source language also exists in the target language, but with a different meaning.",
        "For example, let us assume that we wanted to translate the word can (house) from Catalan to English.",
        "Suppose further that we are lucky and have ten Catalan citations with this word in our English corpus.",
        "But this will not help us because the word can happens to also belong to English, meaning something completely different.",
        "Moreover, can is a high frequency word, occurring millions of times in a large corpus.",
        "Of course, if we had a perfect word sense disambiguator, we could separate the Catalan and the English occurrences of can, thereby solving the problem.",
        "Unfortunately, existing tools are not powerful enough to do the job.",
        "What is worse, such collisions are not",
        "What will happen if a source word does not occur at all in the corpus, or only once or twice?",
        "We mentioned already that an appropriate choice of text genre, corpus size, and window size can somewhat reduce the problem of data sparseness.",
        "We also mentioned that by reversing source and target languages we can look at the problem from",
        "Which, for example, by using open source tools such as Moses and Giza++ (see www.statmt.org) can be easily generated from parallel corpora, e.g. from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) or the JRC Acquis corpus (Steinberger et al., 2006).",
        "If we assume that foreign words typically occur in clusters, we could also use language identification software.",
        "Suppose we tried to identify the translation of the German word Straße and our gold standard listed street as the correct translation.",
        "If, however, our system produced road this would be considered much of an error as if it had produced a very remote word such as volcano.",
        "Hence, considering only a single word as being correct, which is the consequence of using as gold standard the resource exemplified in Table 1, implies that performance figures are artificially low, giving us only the lower bound of the true performance.",
        "languages, then it does not matter that 8 source uncommon between languages using the same script.",
        "So what can we do?",
        "Our suggestion is exactly the same as above for the problem of data sparseness, i.e. to look at several source languages in parallel.",
        "But it is clear that collapsing all source words into a single item does not work.",
        "If only one of them happens to be also a common word in the target language, it is very likely that its co-occurrences will override the co-occurrences of the foreign words we are interested in.",
        "So there is little chance to come up with a correct result.",
        "context.",
        "Let us develop the idea.",
        "In preliminary experiments we have tried several possibilities.",
        "Collapsing the source words would be equivalent to adding the respective cooccurrence vectors.",
        "This is apparently not adequate because, as mentioned above, the vector of a very frequent word would dominate all others.",
        "An alternative would be to sum up the association vectors.",
        "By the term association vector we mean the co-occurrence vectors after application of an association measure (in our case the log-likelihood ratio).",
        "It turns out that this somewhat reduces the problem without solving it entirely.",
        "Another possibility would be vector multiplication.",
        "Multiplication is considerably better than addition as a property of multiplication is that moderate but coinciding support for a particular target word from several source words leads to a higher product than strong support by only a few.",
        "This is a highly desirable property as it helps us avoiding the homograph trap, and because all values are subject to considerable sampling errors.",
        "tio are very good, and since it seems reasonably well suited for sparse data (Dunning, 1993), we suggest to multiply log-likelihood ranks rather than log-likelihood scores.",
        "This proposal is based on the observation (Dunning, 1993) that rankings of association strengths as produced by the log-",
        "To the best of our knowledge no other measure could consistently beat it over a wide range of NLP applications.",
        "likelihood ratio tend to be highly accurate even at higher ranks.",
        "Let us call this procedure the prod-uct-of-rank algorithm",
        "This algorithm works as follows: Starting from a vocabulary of target language words (which are the translation candidates), for each of these words an association vector is computed.",
        "Next, for each association vector the ranks of all words in the source language word tuple under consideration are determined.",
        "Hence, if we have three languages (e.g. English, French and German) we would get three values.",
        "These values are multiplied with each other, and finally all target language words are sorted according to the resulting products.",
        "As small ranks stand for strong associations, the word obtaining the smallest value is considered to be the translation of the source language tuple.",
        "This algorithm turned out to lead to highly plausible rankings and to be robust with regard to sampling errors.",
        "It is also quite effective in eliminating the homograph problem."

        "The basic idea underlying our work is to look at citations of foreign words, to compute their co-occurrence-based associations, and to consider these as translations of the respective words.",
        "We pointed out some difficulties with this approach, namely the problem of data sparseness ;ms.",
        "expectations der to avoid raising unjustified expectations, we presented somewhat conservative figures which should leave room for improvements.",
        "Obvious extensions of the current work are to increase the number of considered languages and to also use other large monolingual corpora.",
        "For example, we could use the web corpora provided by the web-as-a-corpus (WaCky) initiative (Ba-roni et al., 2009).",
        "A few such corpora have already been made available recently, and as they are based on a largely automatic acquisition procedure there are probably more to come.",
        "This reflects a tendency towards extremely large corpora.",
        "Processing in the current framework turns out to be unproblematic if sparse matrices are used, as foreign word occurrences are implicitly of low frequency.",
        "Although web corpora should be very noisy in comparison to the carefully edited newsticker texts used here, the interesting thing is that according to the hypothesis formulated in the introduction the current approach seems to provide one of the rare occasions where noisy data is better than perfectly clean data, and we hope that future work will prove this prediction correct.",
        "Another possibility for future work is to look at second rather than first order associations, i.e. to consider those words as potential translations of a given foreign word which show similar context words.",

        "At the lexical level, our mind's unknown inner workings may be in effect analogous to clustering words according to their observed cooccurrence patterns.",
        "The likely result is that in some cases there will be many interconnections between clusters, and in other cases few.",
        "Depending on the language environment experienced by a person, we cannot rule out that some of the larger clusters might exactly correspond to languages.",
        "But what the current research does",
        "Having looked at the quantitative results, some sample output may also be of interest.",
