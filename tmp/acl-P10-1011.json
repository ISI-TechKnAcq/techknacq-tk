        "Bilingual lexicons are useful for both end users and computerized language processing tasks.",
        "They provide, for each source language word or phrase, a set of translations in the target language, and thus they are a basic component of dictionaries, which also include syntactic information, sense division, usage examples, semantic fields, usage guidelines, etc.",
        "Traditionally, when bilingual lexicons are not compiled manually, they are extracted from parallel corpora.",
        "However, for most language pairs parallel bilingual corpora either do not exist or are at best small and unrepresentative of the general language.",
        "Bilingual lexicons can be generated using nonparallel corpora or pivot language lexicons (see",
        "Section 2).",
        "However, such lexicons are noisy.",
        "In this paper we present a method for generating a high quality lexicon given such a noisy one.",
        "Our evaluation focuses on the pivot language case.",
        "Pivot language approaches deal with the scarcity of bilingual data for most language pairs by relying on the availability of bilingual data for each of the languages in question with a third, pivot, language.",
        "In practice, this third language is often English.",
        "A naive method for pivot-based lexicon generation goes as follows.",
        "For each source headword, take its translations to the pivot language using the source-to-pivot lexicon, then for each such translation take its translations to the target language using the pivot-to-target lexicon.",
        "This method yields highly noisy ('divergent') lexicons, because lexicons are generally intransitive.",
        "This intransitivity stems from polysemy in the pivot language that does not exist in the source language.",
        "For example, take French-English-Spanish.",
        "The English word spring is the translation of the French word printemps, but only in the season of year sense.",
        "Further translating spring into Spanish yields both the correct translation primavera and an incorrect one, resorte (the elastic object).",
        "To cope with the issue of divergence due to lexical intransitivity, we present an algorithm for assessing the correctness of candidate translations.",
        "The algorithm is quite simple to understand and to implement and is computationally efficient.",
        "In spite of its simplicity, we are not aware of previous work applying it to our problem.",
        "The algorithm utilizes two monolingual corpora, comparable in their domain but otherwise unrelated, in the source and target languages.",
        "It does not need a pivot language corpus.",
        "The algorithm comprises two stages: signature genera-",
        "!In this paper we focus on single word head entries.",
        "Multi-word expressions form a major topic in NLP and their handling is deferred to future work.",
        "tion and signature ranking.",
        "The signature of word w is the set of words that co-occur with w most strongly.",
        "While co-occurrence scores are used to compute signatures, signatures, unlike context vectors, do not contain the score values.",
        "For each given source headword we compute its signature and the signatures of all of its candidate translations.",
        "We present the non-aligned signatures (NAS) similarity score for signature and use it to rank these translations.",
        "NAS is based on the number of headword signature words that may be translated using the input noisy lexicon into words in the signature of a candidate translation.",
        "We evaluate our algorithm by generating a bilingual lexicon for Hebrew and Spanish using pivot Hebrew-English and English-Spanish lexicons compiled by a professional publishing house.",

        "Parallel corpora are often used to infer word-oriented machine-readable bilingual lexicons.",
        "The texts are aligned to each other, at chunk and/or word-level.",
        "Alignment is generally evaluated by consistency (source words should be translated to a small number of target words over the entire corpus) and minimal shifting (in each occurrence, the source should be aligned to a translation nearby).",
        "For a review of such methods see (Lopez, 2008).",
        "The limited availability of parallel corpora of sufficient size for most language pairs restricts the usefulness of these methods.",
        "Tanaka and Umemura (1994) generated a bilingual lexicon using a pivot language.",
        "They approached lexical intransitivity divergence using Inverse Consultation (IC).",
        "IC examines the intersection of two pivot language sets: the set of pivot translations of a source-language word w, and the set of pivot translations of each target-language word that is a candidate for being a translation to w. IC generally requires that the intersection set contains at least two words, which are synonyms.",
        "For example, the intersection of the English translations of French printemps and Spanish resorte contains only a single word, spring.",
        "The intersection for a correct translation pair printemps and primavera may include two synonym words, spring and springtime.",
        "Variations of this method were proposed by (Kaji and Aizono, 1996; Bond et al., 2001; Paik et al., 2004; Ahn and Frampton, 2006).",
        "One weakness of IC is that it relies on pivot language synonyms to identify correct translations.",
        "In the above example, if the relatively rare springtime had not existed or was missing from the input lexicons, IC would not have been able to discern that primavera is a correct translation.",
        "This may result in low recall.",
        "Mausam et al.",
        "(2009) used many input bilingual lexicons to create bilingual lexicons for new language pairs.",
        "They represent the multiple input lexicons in a single undirected graph, with words from all the lexicons as nodes.",
        "The input lexicons translation pairs define the edges in the graph.",
        "New translation pairs are inferred based on cycles in the graph, that is, the existence of multiple paths between two words in different languages.",
        "In a sense, this is a generalization of the pivot language idea, where multiple pivots are used.",
        "In the example above, if both English and German are used as pivots, printemps and primavera would be accepted as correct because they are linked by both English spring and German Fruehling, while printemps and resorte are not linked by any German pivot.",
        "This multiple-pivot idea is similar to Inverse Consultation in that multiple pivots are required, but using multiple pivot languages frees it from the dependency on rich input lexicons that contain a variety of synonyms.",
        "This is replaced, however, with the problem of coming up with multiple suitable input lexicons.",
        "Dictionaries published by a single publishing house tend to partition the semantic fields of headwords in the same way.",
        "Thus the first translation of some English headword in the English-Spanish and in the English-Hebrew dictionaries would correspond to the same sense of the headword, and would therefore constitute translations of each other.",
        "The applicability of this method is limited by the availability of machine-readable dictionaries produced by the same publishing house.",
        "Not surprisingly, this method has been proposed by lexicographers working in such companies (Skoumalova, 2001).",
        "Rapp (1999) and Fung (1998) discussed semantic similarity estimation using cross-lingual context vector alignment.",
        "Both works rely on a pre-existing large (16-20K entries), correct, one-to-one lexicon between the source and target languages, which is used to align context vectors between languages.",
        "The context vector data was extracted from comparable (monolingual but domain-related) corpora.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2002) were able to do without the initial large lexicon by limiting themselves to related languages that share a writing system, and using identically-spelled words as context words.",
        "Garera et al.",
        "methods for improving the context vectors data in each language before aligning them.",
        "Garera et al.",
        "(2009) replaced the traditional window-based cooccurrence counting with dependency-tree based counting, while Pekar et al.",
        "(2006) predicted missing co-occurrence values based on similar words in the same language.",
        "In the latter work, the one-to-one lexicon assumption was not made: when a context word had multiple equivalents, it was mapped into all of them, with the original probability equally distributed between them.",
        "Pivot Language.",
        "Using cross-lingual cooccurrences to improve a lexicon generated using a pivot language was suggested by Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996).",
        "Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) created lexicons between English and a target local language (e.g. Gujarati) using a related language (e.g. Hindi) as pivot.",
        "An English pivot lexicon was used in conjunction with pivot-target cognates.",
        "Cross-lingual co-occurrences were used to remove errors, together with other cues such as edit distance and Inverse Document Frequencies (IDF) scores.",
        "It appears that this work assumed a single alignment was possible from English to the target language.",
        "Kaji et al.",
        "(2008) used a pivot English lexicon to generate initial Japanese-Chinese and Chinese-Japanese lexicons, then used co-occurrences information, aligned using the initial lexicon, to identify correct translations.",
        "Unlike other works, which require alignments of pairs (i.e., two co-occurring words in one language translatable into two co-occurring words in the other), this method relies on alignments of 3-word cliques in each language, every pair of which frequently co-occurring.",
        "This is a relatively rare occurrence, which may explain the low recall rates of their results."

        "Our algorithm uses two unrelated monolingual corpora.",
        "At the heart of our method is the non-aligned signatures (NAS) context similarity score, used for removing incorrect translations using cross-lingual cooccurrences.",
        "Words in one language tend to have multiple translations in another.",
        "The common method for context similarity scoring utilizes some algebraic distance between context vectors, and requires a single alignment of context vectors in one language into the other.",
        "Finding a single correct alignment is unrealistic even when a perfectly correct lexicon is available.",
        "For example, alignment forces us to choose one correct translation for each context word, while in practice a few possible terms may be used interchangeably in the other language.",
        "In our task, moreover, the lexicon used for alignment was automatically generated from pivot language lexicons and was expected to contain errors.",
        "NAS does not depend on finding a single correct alignment.",
        "While it measures how well the sets of words that tend to co-occur with these two words align to each other, its strength may lie in bypassing the question of which word in one language should be aligned to a certain context word in the other language.",
        "Therefore, unlike other scoring methods, it is not effected by incorrect alignments.",
        "We have shown that NAS outperforms the more traditional distance metrics, which we adapted to the many-to-many scenario by amortizing across multiple alignments.",
        "Our results confirm that alignment is problematic in using co-occurrence methods across languages, at least in our settings.",
        "NAS constitutes a way to avoid this problem.",
        "While the purpose of this work was to discern correct translations from incorrect one, it is worth noting that our method actually ranks translation correctness.",
        "This is a stronger property, which may render it useful in a wider range of scenarios.",
        "In fact, NAS can be viewed as a general measure for word similarity between languages.",
        "It would be interesting to further investigate this observation with other sources of lexicons (e.g., obtained from parallel or comparable corpora) and for other tasks, such as cross-lingual word sense disambiguation and information retrieval."
