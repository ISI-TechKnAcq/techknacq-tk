        "(Hillard et al., 2003) explored unsupervised machine learning approaches and on manual transcripts, they achieved an overall 3-way agreement/disagreement classification accuracy as 82% with keyword features.",
        "(Galley et al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the detection of (dis)agreements.",
        "They used adjacency pair information to determine the structure of their conditional Markov model and outperformed the results of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3-way classification accuracy into 86.9%.",
        "(Hahn et al., 2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms and reached a competitive performance of 86.7% 3-way classification accuracy on manual transcriptions with only lexical features.",

        "Our work differs from these previous studies in two major categories.",
        "One is that a different definition of (dis)agreement was used.",
        "In the current work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a responding speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first speaker.",
        "Second, we explored (dis)agreement detection in broadcast conversation.",
        "Due to the difference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality between speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meetings, (dis)agreement may have different characteristics.",
        "Different from the unsupervised approaches in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised approaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted supervised training.",
        "Also, different from (Hillard et al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classification was carried out on the utterance level, instead of on the spurt-level.",

        "Agreements and disagreements are composed of different combinations of initiating utterances and responses.",
        "We reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as the sequence tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for identifying whether a given utterance is initiating a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement response to such an opportunity, or is neither of these, in the show.",
        "For example, a Negative tag question followed by a negation response forms an agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not black and white, is it?",
        "B: [Agreeing Response] No, it isn't.",
        "The data sparsity problem is serious.",
        "Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or response utterances, about 10% only among all data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved.",
        "These annotators also labeled shows with a variety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language use constituents, LUC), including discourse markers, disfluencies, person addresses and person mentions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dialog act tags (DAT).",
        "We categorized dialog acts into statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete.",
        "We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses (e.g., uh, um), repetitions, corrections, and false starts.",
        "Person address (PA) terms are terms that a speaker uses to address another person.",
        "Person mentions (PM) are references to non-participants in the conversation.",
        "Discourse markers (DM) are words or phrases that are related to the structure of the discourse and express a relation between two utterances, for example, I mean, you know.",
        "Prefaces (PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving functions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think that...).",

        "We preprocessed English manual transcripts by removing transcriber annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation and case information, and conducting text normalization.",

        "A decision tree model was used to compute posteriors from prosodic features and we used cumulative binning of posteriors as final features , similar to (Liu et al., 2006).",

        "One of the motivations of choosing conditional random fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found in hidden Markov models.",
