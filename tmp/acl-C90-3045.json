        "Introduction Tree-adjoining grammars (TAG) constitute a grammatical formalism with attractive properties for the strong characterization of the syntax of natural languages, that is, characterization of the analysis trees of the expressions in the language (Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Kroch, 1989).1 Among these properties are that OThe domain of locality in TAGs is larger than for formalisms that augment context-free grammars (such as lexical-functional, or generalized or head driven phrase-structure grammar), and OThe statements of dependencies and recursion possibilities in a tree are factored, the former following from primitive dependencies in elementary trees, the latter a consequence of an operation of adjunction of trees.",
        "These unique properties of TAGs present a challenge for the application of TAGs beyond the limited confines of syntax, for instance, to the task of semantic interpretation or automatic translation of natural language.",
        "The standard methods of moving beyond syntax to interpretation make use in one way or another of the compositional structure of the analysis tree that is manifested in the tree's derivation.",

        "However, in the case of TAGs, the compositional structure of the tree is not mirrored by its derivational structure, so that a method for constructing semantics based on the compositional syntactic structure will be inherently nonderivational, that is, construction of the semantics will be independent of the derivation of the tree, and therefore subsequent.",
        "On the other hand, a method mirroring the derivational structure will not necessarily be compositional with respect to the derived structures of expressions.",
        "Although such a method would be quite different from the primarily compositional methods previously postulated, it may have advantages, given that certain aspects of language seem to be noncompositional.",

        "If we project the pairs onto their first or second components (ignoring the cross links), the projections are TAGs for an English fragment and an LF fragment, respectively.",
        "These grammars are themselves written in a particular variant of TAGs; the choice of this base formalism, as we will call it, is free.",

        "We turn to the question of why, in augmenting TAGs for the purposes of encoding semantic information, it is preferable to use the synchronous TAG method over more conventional methods, such as semantic rules involving logical operations (as in Montague grammar or generalized phrase-structure grammar) or complexfeature-structure encodings (as in unification-based or logic grammar formalisms).",
        "First, the arguments for factoring recursion and dependencies as TAGs do for the syntax of natural language have their counterparts in the semantics.",
        "The structure of TAGs allows syntactic dependenciesagreement, sub categorization, and so forthto be localized in the primitives of a grammar, the elementary trees.",
        "This is most dramatically evident in the case of long-distance dependencies, such as that between a wh-phrase and its associated gap.",
        "Similarly, using TAGs to construct logical forms allows the localization of semantic dependencies in the logical forms of natural language expressions, dependencies such as the signature requirements (argument type and arity) of function and relation symbols, and even the long-distance dependencies between a whquantifier and its associated bound variable.",
        "With other methods of semantics, these dependencies cannot be localized; the semantic aspects of filler-gap dependencies must be passed among the features of various nodes in a parse tree or otherwise distributed over the entire derivation.",
        "Second, the use of the synchronous TAG augmentation allows an even more radical reduction in the role of features in a TAG grammar.",
        "Because of the extended domain of locality that TAGs possess, the role of features and unification is reduced from its role in context-free based systems.",
        "Only finite-valued features are needed, with the possible exception of a feature whose value encodes an expression's logical form.",
        "In removing the construction of logical forms from the duties delegated to features, we can maintain a strictly finite-valued-and therefore formally dispensablefeature system for TAGs.",
        "As a side note, we mention a ramification of the synchronous TAG analysis concerning the claim of Kaplan and Zaenen (1989) that the paths over which long-distance dependencies operate (in the f-structure of lexical-functional grammatical theory) form a regular language.",
        "Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1989) provide an argument that this claim follows from several assumptions concerning how a feature system for TAGs might be constrained.",
        "Vijay-Shanker (personal communication) has noted that by placing a simple assumption on the elementary trees in the logical form component of a synchronous TAG, the proof of this claim becomes immediate.",
        "Any TAG in which all foot nodes are immediate children of their associated root generates a tree path language that is regular.5 Thus, a synchronous TAG (like the grammar presented in Figure 1) whose semantic component forms a TAG with this property necessarily obeys the regular language constraint on long-distance semantic dependencies."

        "In order to characterize quantifier scoping possibilities, we use a synchronous TAG whose base formalism is multicomponent TAGs (Joshi, 1987), in which the primitive operation is incorporation (by multiple substitutions and adjunctions) of a set of elementary trees at once.",
        "In synchronous multicomponent TAGs, the links between trees connect, in general, a set of nodes in one tree with a set in another.",
        "In particular, an NP will be linked both to a formula in the semantics (the quantifier's scope) and a term (the position bound by the quantifier).",
        "We will",

        "To distinguish two separate links from a single link among several nodes, we use a coindexingrather than graphical----notation for links.",
        "Thus, the subject NP node on the left is linked with both the F and first T node on the right, as indicated by the boxed index 1.",
        "The interpretation of such \"hyper-links\" is that when a pair is chosen to operate at the link, it must have sets of the correct sizes as its left and right component (1 and 2 in the case at hand) and the sets are simultaneously used at the various nodes as in a multicomponent TAG.",
        "For instance, a quantifiable noun will be paired with a set of two trees:6",
        "a target expression from a source or vice versa.",
        "Thus, it can be used to characterize both of these mappings.",
        "Furthermore, the existence of a parsing algorithm for the base formalism of a synchronous TAG is a sufficient condition for interpreting a synchronous TAG grammar.",
        "Schabes and Joshi (1988) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (198$) provide parsing algorithms for TAGs that could serve to parse the base formalism of a synchronous TAG.",
        "Given such an algorithm, semantic interpretation can be performed by parsing the sentence according to the source grammar; the pairings then determine a derivation in the target language for the logical form.",
        "Generation from a logical form proceeds by the converse process of parsing the logical form expression thereby determining the derivation for the natural language sentence:.",
        "Machine translation proceeds along similar lines by mapping two TAGs directly (Abeille et al., 1990).",
        "In previous work, one of us noted that generation according to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be semantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived semantics for an expression must include, in an appropriate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.",
        "It is interesting to note that synchronous TAGs are inherently semantically monotonic.",
        "Furthermore, it is reasonable to require that the semantic component of a synchronous TAG be lexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.",
        "(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing according to the semantic grammar and, consequently, more efficient generation.",
        "In the case of augmented context free grammars, the semantic monotonicity requirement precludes \"lexicalization\" of the semantics.",
        "It is not possible to require nontrivial semantics to be associated with each lexical item.",
        "In summary, just as lexicalization of the syntactic grammar aids parsing (Schabes and Joshi, 1990), so lexicalization of the semantic grammar aids generation.",
        "The description of parsing and generation above may seem to imply that these processes cannot be performed incrementally, that is, an entire source derivation must be recovered before the corresponding target derivation can be computed.",
        "The issue deserves clarification.",
        "In the case where the synchronous TAG is order independent (that is, the order of derivation in one TAG does not effect the result in the other, as when no two links share an endpoint) there is a one-to-one mapping between the source and target derivation.",
        "When partial source derivations are recognized by the parser, the corresponding partial target derivation (for example semantic interpretation) can be incrementally computed: as the input is read from left to right, interpretations of the partial target derivations corresponding to partial source derivations can be combined in one step to build a larger partial target derivation.",
        "When the synchronous TAG is order-sensitive, however, there may be a many-to-many correspondence between source derivations and target derivations.",
        "This is the case, for instance, in a grammar in which alternative quantifier scopings may be generated for a single sentence.",
        "In this case, it is unclear what should even be meant by incremental computation.",
        "For instance, midway in parsing a sentence, at a point at which a single quantified NP has been analyzed, the incremental interpretation could not possibly represent all possible scopings that that quantifier might end up taking, as it is not known what the quantifier might be required to scope with respect to.",
        "At the point in the parse where the scoping decision can be made, it is not clear whether an incrementality requirement would mean that the variant scopings must all be explicitly generated at that point, or only implicitly generable.",
        "With respect to synchronous TAGs, these considerations are reflected in choice of parsing algorithm.",
        "Efficiency of parsing necessitates that only one canonical derivation (say leftmost or rightmost) need to be computed; all other derivations yield the same object.",
        "Standard parsing algorithms for both TAGs and CFGs rely on this optimization.",
        "If incrementality requires that we generate explicit representations of all possible interpretations (i.e., target derivations) of the string seen so far, then this optimization cannot be used, and parsing will be highly inefficient.",
        "If the representation can be left implicit, the optimization can be maintained, but retrieval of explicit representations will be combinatorially more complex."
