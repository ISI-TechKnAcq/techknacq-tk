        "The estimation of semantic similarity between words, sentences and documents is a fundamental problem for many research disciplines including computational linguistics (Malandrakis et al., 2011), semantic web (Corby et al., 2006), cognitive science and artificial intelligence (Resnik, 2011; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001).",
        "In this paper, we study the geometrical structure of the lexical space in order to extract semantic relations among words.",
        "In (Karlgren et al., 2008), the high-dimensional lexical space is assumed to consist of manifolds of very low dimensionality that are embedded in this high dimensional space.",
        "The manifold hypothesis is compatible with evidence from psycholinguistics and cognitive science.",
        "In (Tenenbaum et al., 2011), the question ?How does the mind work??",
        "is answered as follows: cognitive organization is based on domains with similar items connected to each other and lexical information is represented hierarchically, i.e., a domain that consists of similar lexical entries may be represented by a more abstract concept.",
        "An example of such a domain is {blue, red, yellow, pink, ...} that corresponds by the concept of color.",
        "An inspiring analysis about the geometry of thought, as well as cognitive evidence for the low-dimensional manifold assumption can be found in (Gardenfors, 2000), e.g., the domain of color is argued to be cognitively represented as an one-dimensional manifold.",
        "Following the low-dimensional manifold hypothesis we propose to extend distributional semantic models (DSMs) into a hierarchical model of domains (or concepts) that contain semantically similar words.",
        "Global operations on the lexical space are decomposed into local operations on the low-dimensional domain sub-manifolds.",
        "Our goal is to exploit this hierarchical low-rank model to estimate relations between words, such as semantic similarity.",
        "There has been much research interest on devising data-driven approaches for estimating semantic similarity between words.",
        "DSMs (Baroni and Lenci, 2010) are based on the distributional hypothesis of meaning (Harris, 1954) assuming that semantic similarity between words is a function of the overlap of their linguistic contexts.",
        "DSMs are typically constructed from co-occurrence statistics of word tuples that are extracted on existing corpora or on corpora specifically harvested from the web.",
        "In (Iosif and Potamianos, 2013), general-purpose, language-agnostic algorithms were proposed for estimating semantic similarity using no linguistic resources other than a corpus created via web queries.",
        "The key idea of this work was the construction of semantic networks and semantic neighborhoods that capture smooth This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "731 co-occurrence and context similarity statistics.",
        "The majority of DSMs adopt high-dimensional represen-tations, while the underlying space geometry is not explicitly taken into consideration during the design of algorithms aimed for performing several semantic tasks.",
        "We propose the construction of a low-dimensional manifold DSM consting of four steps: 1) identify the domains that correspond to the low-dimensional manifolds, 2) run the dimensionality reduction algorithm for each domain, 3) construct a DSM for each domain, and 4) combine the manifold DSMs to come up with global measures of lexical relations.",
        "A variety of algorithms can be found in the literature for projecting a set of tokens into low dimensional sub-spaces, given a token similarity or dissimilarity matrix.",
        "Depending on the nature of the dataset, these projection algorithms may or may not preserve the local geometries of the original dataset.",
        "Most dimensionality reduction algorithms make the implicit assumption that the underlying space is metric, e.g., Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) (Torgerson, 1952) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2005) or the ones using non-negative matrix factorization (Tsuge et al., 2001) and typically fail to capture the geometry of manifolds embedded in high dimensional spaces.",
        "A variety of dimensionality reduction algorithms have been developed that respect the local geometry.",
        "Some examples are the Isomap algorithm (Tenenbaum et al., 2000) that performs the projection based on a weighted neighborhood graph, Local Linear Embedings (LLE) (Roweis and Saul, 2000) that assigns neighbors to each data point, Random Projections (Baraniuk and Wakin, 2009), (Li et al., 2006) that preserves the manifold geometry by executing random linear projections and others (Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE) (Donoho and Grimes, 2003); Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) (Wang, 2011)).",
        "The manifold hypothesis has also been studied by the representation learning community where the local geometry is disentangled from the global geometry mainly by using neighborhood graphs (Weston et al., 2012) or coding schemes (Yu et al., 2009).",
        "For a review see (Bengio et al., 2013).",
        "A fundamental problem with all aforementioned methods when applied to lexical semantic spaces is that they do not account for ambiguous tokens, i.e., word senses.",
        "The main assumption of dimensionality reduction and manifold unfolding algorithms is that each token (word) belongs to a single sub-manifold.",
        "This in fact is not true for polysemous words, for example the word ?green?",
        "could belong both to the domain colors, as well as to the domain plants.",
        "In essence, lexical semantic spaces are manifolds that have singularities: the manifold collapses in the neighborhood of polysemous words that can be thought of semantic black holes that can instantaneously transfer you from one domain to another.",
        "Our proposed solution to this problem is to allow words to live in multiple sub-manifolds.",
        "The algorithms proposed in this paper build on recent research work on distributional semantic models and manifold representational learning.",
        "Manifold DSMs can be trained directly from a corpus and do not require a-priori knowledge or any human-annotated resources (just like DSMs).",
        "We show that the proposed low-dimensional, sparse and hierarchical manifold representation significantly improves on the state-of-the-art for the problem of semantic similarity estimation.",
        "2 Metrics of Semantic Similarity Semantic similarity metrics can be broadly divided into the following types: (i) metrics that rely on knowledge resources (e.g., WordNet), and (ii) corpus-based that do not require any external knowledge source.",
        "Corpus-based metrics are formalized as Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) (Baroni and Lenci, 2010) based on the distributional hypothesis of meaning (Harris, 1954).",
        "DSMs can be distinguished into (i) unstructured: use bag-of-words model (Iosif and Potamianos, 2010) and (ii) structured: exploitation of syntactic relationships between words (Grefenstette, 1994; Baroni and Lenci, 2010).",
        "The vector space model (VSM) constitutes the main implementation for both unstructured and structured DSMs.",
        "Cosine similarity constitutes a measurement of word similarity that is widely used on top of the VSM.",
        "The similarity between two words is estimated as the cosine of their respective vectors whose elements correspond to corpus-based co-occurrence statistics.",
        "In essence, the similarity between words is computed via second-order co-occurrences.",
        "Direct (i.e., first-order) co-occurrences can be also used for the estimation of semantic similarity (Bol- legala et al., 2007; Gracia et al., 2006).",
        "The exploitation of first-order co-occurrence statistics constitutes the simplest form of unstructured DSMs.",
        "A key parameter for such models is the definition of the context in which the words of interest co-occur: from entire documents (Bollegala et al., 2007) to paragraphs 732 (V?eronis, 2004) and sentences (Iosif and Potamianos, 2013).",
        "The effect of co-occurrence context for the task of similarity computation between nouns is discussed in (Iosif and Potamianos, 2013).",
        "The underlying assumption is that two words that co-occur in a specified context are semantically related.",
        "3 Collapsed Manifold Hypothesis, Low-Dimensionality and Sparsity The intuition behind this work is that although the lexical semantic space proper is high-dimensional, it is organized in such a way that interesting semantic relations can be exported from manifolds of much lower dimensionality embedded in this high dimensional space (Karlgren et al., 2008).",
        "We assume that (at least some of) these sub-manifolds contain semantically similar words (or word senses).",
        "For example, a potential sub-manifold in the lexical space could be the one that contains the colors (e.g., red, blue, green).",
        "But in fact many words, such as book, green, fruit, are expected to belong simultaneously in semantically different manifolds because they have multiple meanings.",
        "A simple way to bootstrap the manifold recreation process is to build a domain around each word, i.e., the semantic neighborhood of each word defines a domain.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 we show the semantic neighborhood of fruit.",
        "The connections between words indicate high semantic similarity, i.e., this is a pruned semantic similarity graph of all words in the semantic neighborhood of the word ?fruit?.",
        "It is clear from this example that in a typical neighborhood there exist word pairs that should be native genus b shurb b plant flowering b tree b species b b garden b soil b animal b water b seed flower b b fruit b vegetable b apple juice daiquiri b orange b drink b zest b lemon sugar salt b flour b cream b butter b b b milk b corn b honey b tomato b b b b Figure 1: Visualization of the semantic neighborhood of the word ?fruit?.",

        "because they are semantically apart, like {garden, salt}.",

        "S as the percentage of 0's in the matrix.",
        "4 Dimensionality Reduction In this section, the Sparse Projection (SP) algorithm is described (see also Algorithm 1).",
        "SP is the core algorithm for constructing manifold DSMs presented in Section 5.",
        "SP is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that projects a set of n words into a vector space of d dimensions.",
        "The input to the algorithm is a dissimilarity or semantic distance matrix P ?",

        "Each paragraph that follows corresponds to a module in Algorithm 1.",
        "1 Compare for example with Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000) were a short- and long-distance metric is used.",
        "When using sparse encoding the long-distance metric is set to a very large fixed number (similarity set to 0).",
        "In both cases, the underlying manifold is unfolded and low-dimensional representation with (close to) metric properties are discovered.",

        "Connectivity Graph and Sparsity: As discussed in Section 3, given a set of words only a small subset of lexical relations should be explicitly encoded between pairs of these words.",
        "Therefore, the SP algorithm should only take into account strongly related word pairs and ignore the rest.",

        "The proposed representation consists of low-dimensional manifolds that are derived from sparse projections of semantic neighborhoods.",
        "The core idea of low dimensional subspaces was motivated by cognitive models of conceptual spaces.",
        "The validity of this motivation was experimentally verified via the estimation of semantic similarity between nouns.",
        "The proposed approach was found to be (at least) competitive with other state-of-the-art DSM approaches that adopt flat feature representations and do not explicitly include the sparsity and dimensionality as a key design parameter.",
        "The poor performance of Isomap and LLE can be attributed to the nature of the specific application, i.e., word semantics.",
        "A key characteristic of this application is the ambiguity of word senses.",
        "These algorithms assume only one sense for each word (i.e., a word is represented as a single point in a high-dimensional space).",
        "Although the disambiguation task is not explicitly addressed, LDMS approach handles the ambiguity of words by isolating each word's senses in different domains.",
        "Our initial intuition regarding the semantic fragmentation of lexical neighborhoods due to singularities introduced by word senses was supported by the high performance when large (i.e., 80% - 90%) degree of sparseness was imposed.",
        "The hypothesis of low-dimensional representation was validated by the finding that as little as three dimensions are adequate for representing domain/neighborhood semantics.",
        "It was also observed that the parameters of the LDMS model, i.e., number of dimensions, neighborhoodsize and degree of sparseness, are interrelated: very sparse projections achieve best results with very low dimensionality when large neighborhood sizes are used.",
        "This is only a first step toward using ensembles of low-dimensional DSMs for semantic relation estimation.",
        "As future work we plan to further investigate the creation of domains based on more complex geometric properties of the underlying space (Kreyszig, 2007).",
        "A more formal investigation of the relation between sparseness, dimensionality and performance is also needed.",
        "Finally, creating multi-level hierarchical representations that are consistent with cognitive organization is an important challenge that can further improve manifold DSM performance.",
