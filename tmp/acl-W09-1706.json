        "The approach described in this paper builds on the distributional hypothesis, the idea that semantically related words are distributed similarly over contexts.",
        "Harris (1968) claims that, 'the meaning of entities and the meaning of grammatical relations among them, is related to the restriction of combinations of these entities relative to other entities.'",
        "In other words, you can grasp the meaning of a word by looking at its context.",
        "Context can be defined in many ways.",
        "In this paper we look at the syntactic contexts a word is found in.",
        "For example, the verbs that are in a object relation with a particular noun form a part of its context.",
        "In accordance with the Firthian tradition these contexts can be used to determine the semantic relatedness of words.",
        "For instance, words that occur in a object relation with the verb drink have something in common: they are liquid.",
        "We will refer to words linked by a syntactic relation, such as drink -OBJ-beer, as syntactic co-occurrences.",
        "Syntactic co-occurrences have often been used in work on lexical acquisition (Lin, 1998b; Dagan et al., 1999; Curran and Moens, 2002; Alfonseca and Manand-har, 2002).",
        "Distributional methods for automatic acquisition of semantically related words suffer from data sparseness.",
        "They generally perform less well on low-frequency words (Weeds and Weir, 2005; van der plas, 2008).",
        "This is a pity because the available resources for semantically related words usually cover the frequent words rather well.",
        "It is for the low-frequency words that automatic methods would be most welcome.",
        "This paper tries to find a way to improve the performance on the words that are most wanted: the middle to very-low-frequency words.",
        "At the basis of the proposed technique lies the intuition that semantic similarity between concepts is transitive: if A is like B and B is like C – A is like C. As explained in the second paragraph of this section, the fact that both milk and water are found in object relation with the verb to drink tells us that they might be similar.",
        "However, even if we had never seen lemonade in the same syntactic contexts as water, we could still infer that lemonade and water are similar because we have found evidence that both water and lemonade are similar to milk.",
        "In an ideal world we would be able to infer that milk and water are related from the syntactic cooccurrences alone, however, because of data sparseness we might not always encounter this evidence directly.",
        "We hope that nearest neighbours are able to account for the missing information.",
        "Nearest neighbours such as milk and water, and water and lemonade are the output of our system.",
        "We used the nearest neighbours (the output of our system) as input to our system that normally takes syntactic cooccurrences as input.",
        "Thus it uses the output of the system as input in a second round to smooth the syntactic co-occurrences.",
        "Grefenstette (1994) discusses the difference between first-and second-order affinities.",
        "There exists a first-order affinity between words if they often appear in the same context, i.e., ifthey are often found in the vicinity of each other.",
        "Words that co-occur frequently such as orange and squeezed have a first-order affinity.",
        "There exists a second-order affinity between words if they share many first-order affinities.",
        "These words need not appear together themselves, but their contexts are similar.",
        "Orange and lemon appear often in similar contexts such as being the object of squeezed, or being modified by juicy.",
        "In this paper we will use second-order affinities as input to the distributional system.",
        "We are thus computing third-order affinities.",
        "There exists a third-order affinity between words, if they share many second-order affinities.",
        "If pear and watermelon are similar and orange and watermelon are similar, then pear and orange have a third-order affinity.",
        "We will refer to traditional approaches that compute second-order affinities as second-order techniques.",
        "In this paper we will compare a second-order technique with a third-order technique, a technique that computes third-order affinities.",

        "In Edmonds (1997) the term third-order is used to refer to a different concept.",

        "Secondly, the notion of higher-order co-occurrences refers to connectivity paths in networks, i.e. the network of relations between words co-occurring is augmented by connecting words that are connected by a path of length 2 (second-order co-occurrences) and paths of length 3 (third-order co-occurrences) and so on.",
        "In the above example water and lemonade would be connected by a second-order relation implied by the network in which water and lemonade both co-occur with for example to pour.",
        "A third-order relation would be implied between lemonade and drink if drink should co-occur with water.",
        "We define third-order affinity as an iterative process of calculating similarity.",
        "The output of the system is fed into the system again.",
        "There exists a third-order affinity between words if they share many nearest neighbours with another word, not if a word shares a context that in turn shares a context with the other word.",
        "The same perspective on higher-order cooccurrence, that of connectivity paths in networks, is taken in literature of computational modelling of the acquisition of word meaning (Lemaire and Den-hire, 2006).",
        "Although Biemann et al.",
        "(2004) work in the same proximity-based tradition as the previous authors their notion of third-order is closer to our definition.",
        "It is defined as an iterative process in which words are linked when their co-occurrence score trespasses a certain threshold.",
        "These nth-order co-occurrences are then used to construct an artificial corpus consisting of the co-occurrence sets retrieved from the original corpus.",
        "Schütze and Walsh (2008) present a graph-theoretic model of lexical-syntactic representation in which higher-order syntactic relations, those that require some generalisation, are defined recursively.",
        "The problem they are trying to solve, lexical syntactic acquisition, is different form ours and so is the evaluation method: discriminating sentences that exhibit local coherence from those that do not.",
        "Again the method is proximity-based, but since the context are defined very locally (left and right neighbours) the results are likely to be more comparable to a syntax-based method than proximity-based methods that use larger contexts."

        "In Table 2 the results of using second-order (2), combined (2+3), and third-order (3) techniques is presented.",
        "The average EWN similarity is shown at several values of k. At k=1 the average EWN similarity between the test word and the nearest neighbour at the first rank is calculated.",
        "For k=3 we average over the top-three nearest neighbours returned by the system and so on.",
        "Results are given for each of the four test sets, the very-low-frequency set (VLF), the low-frequency test set (LF), the middle-frequency test set (MF), and high-frequency test set (HF).",
        "We can easily compare the scores from the second-order technique and the combined technique.",
        "The scores for the third-order technique is a little more difficult to compare because, since there is very little data, it is often not possible for all test words to find the number of nearest neighbours given under k. The coverage of the third-order technique is low, especially for the very-low to low-frequency test set.",
        "Already at k=1 the number of test word is about 60% and 70% (resp.)",
        "of the number of nearest neighbours found when using the second-order technique.",
        "For the middle and high-frequency test set the number of nearest neighbours found is comparable, but less for high values of k.",
        "Let us compare the second-order and combined techniques since coverage of these techniques is more comparable.",
        "We see that the combined method outperforms the second-order method for almost all test sets.",
        "For the high frequency test set there is no difference in performance and for the middle-frequency testset the differences are very small too.",
        "The largest improvements are for the very-low-frequency and low-frequency test set.",
        "This is expected, since the method was introduced to remedy data sparseness and for these words data sparseness is most severe.",
        "We can conclude that exploiting the transitivity of meaning by augmenting the input to the system with nearest neighbours from a previous round results in a higher degree of semantic similarity among very-low and low-frequency words.",
        "The differences in performance are small, but we",
        "Synonyms should keep in mind that that EWN similarity does not go from 0 to 1.",
        "The random baseline reported in van der Plas (2008), i.e. the score obtained by picking random words from EWN as nearest neighbours of a given target word, is 0.26 at k=5 and a score of 1 is impossible unless all words in the testset have k synonyms.",
        "To get a better idea of what is going on we inspected the nearest neighbours that are the output of the system.",
        "There seemed to be many more synonyms in the output of the combined method than in the output of the second-order method.",
        "Because synonymy is the lexical relation that is at the far end of semantic similarity, it is important to find many synonyms.",
        "To quantify our findings we determined the number of synonyms among the nearest neighbours according to EWN.",
        "In Table 3 the number of synonyms as well as the percentage of synonyms found at several values of k is shown.",
        "Our initial findings proved quantifiable.",
        "The combined technique (2+3) results in more synonyms.",
        "Most surprising are the results for the high-frequency testset.",
        "Whereas, based on evaluations with the EWN similarity scores, we believed the method did not do much good for the high-frequency method, we now see that the number of synonyms found is higher when using the combined technique, especially at k=1.",

        "Guided by the idea of the transitivity of meaning we have shown that by augmenting syntactic co-occurrences (that are usually input to distributional methods) with nearest neighbours (the output of the system from a previous round) we are able to improve the performance on low-and middle-frequency words with respect to semantic relatedness in general.",
        "This result is encouraging, because distributional methods usually perform rather poorly on low-and middle-frequency words.",
        "In addition, these are the words that are most sought after, because they are the ones that are missing in existing resources.",
        "There is something to be gained for the high-frequency to low-frequency words in addition.",
        "The percentage of synonyms found is larger when using combined techniques.",
        "In future work we are planning to implement a more principled way of combining syntactic-cooccurrences and nearest neighbours.",
        "The method and results presented here sufficed to support our intuitions, but we believe that more convincing numbers could be attained when fully exploiting the principle.",
        "Since the method uses a combination of labelled and unlabelled data (although in our case the labelling is the result of the same unsupervised method and not of manual annotation), we plan to consult the literature on co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "Also, instead of expanding the syntactic co-occurrences of words with their nearest neighbours we could expand them with the syntactic co-occurrences of their nearest neighbours to arrive at more uniform data.",
        "Lastly, the technique allows for iteration.",
