        "The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that provides a generic solution to the overfitting problem (Barron et al., 1998).",
        "A formalization of Ockham's Razor, it says that the parameters are to be chosen that minimize the description length of the data given the model plus the description length of the model itself.",
        "It has been successfully shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies than simply running the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) employ a Bayesian approach to POS tagging and use sparse Dirichlet priors to minimize model size.",
        "More recently, Ravi and Knight (2009) alternately minimize the model using an integer linear program and maximize likelihood using EM to achieve the highest accuracies on the task so far.",
        "However, in the latter approach, because there is no single objective function to optimize, it is not entirely clear how to generalize this technique to other problems.",
        "In this paper, inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures both the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size).",
        "By using a simple prior that encourages sparsity, we cast our problem as a search for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis and present a variant of EM to approximately search for the minimum-description-length model.",
        "Applying our approach to the POS tagging problem, we obtain higher accuracies than both EM and Bayesian inference as reported by Goldwater and Griffiths (2007).",
        "On a Italian POS tagging task, we obtain even larger improvements.",
        "We find that our objective function correlates well with accuracy, suggesting that this technique might be useful for other problems."

        "In maximum likelihood estimation, the goal is to find parameter estimates",
        "The EM algorithm can be used to find a solution.",

        "Unfortunately, minimization of the L0 norm is known to be NP-hard (Hyder and Mahata, 2009).",
        "It is not smooth, making it unamenable to gradient-based optimization algorithms.",

        "A common method for preferring smaller models is minimizing the L1 norm, i 9i .",
        "However, for a model which is a product of multinomial distributions, the L1 norm is a constant.",
        "Therefore, we cannot use the L1 norm as part of the size term as the result will be the same as the EM algorithm.",
        "To optimize (11), we use MAP EM, which is an iterative search procedure.",

        "Let C(t, w; t, w) count the number of times the word w is tagged as t in t, and C(t, t'; t) the number of times the tag bigram (t, t') appears in t. We can rewrite the M step as subject to the constraints £wP(w | t) = 1 and t' P(t' | t) = 1.",
        "Note that we can optimize each term of both summations over t separately.",
        "For each t, the term is easily optimized as in EM: just let P(w | t) o E[C(t, w)].",
        "But the term is trickier.",
        "This is a non-convex optimization problem for which we invoke a publicly available constrained optimization tool, ALGENCAN (An-dreani et al., 2007).",
