        "Much research in natural language processing has gone into the development of rule-based machine learning algorithms.",
        "These algorithms are attractive because they often capture the linguistic features of a corpus in a small and concise set of rules.",
        "Transformation-based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is one of the most successful rule-based machine learning algorithms.",
        "It is a flexible method which is easily extended to various tasks and domains, and it has been applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks, including part of speech tagging (Brill, 1995), noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999), parsing (Brill, 1996), phrase chunking (Florian et al., 2000), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), prepositional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994), dialog act tagging (Samuel et al., 1998), segmentation and message understanding (Day et al., 1997).",
        "Furthermore, transformation-based learning achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks, and is fairly resistant to overtrain-ing (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994).",
        "Despite its attractive features as a machine learning algorithm, TBL does have a serious drawback in its lengthy training time, especially on the larger-sized corpora often used in NLP tasks.",
        "For example, a well-implemented transformation-based part-of-speech tagger will typically take over 38 hours to finish training on a 1 million word corpus.",
        "This disadvantage is further exacerbated when the transformation-based learner is used as the base learner in learning algorithms such as boosting or active learning, both of which require multiple iterations of estimation and application of the base learner.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel method which enables a transformation-based learner to reduce its training time dramatically while still retaining all of its learning power.",
        "In addition, we will show that our method scales better with training data size."

        "The central idea of transformation-based learning (TBL) is to learn an ordered list of rules which progressively improve upon the current state of the training set.",
        "An initial assignment is made based on simple statistics, and then rules are greedily learned to correct the mistakes, until no net improvement can be made.",
        "The following definitions and notations will be used throughout the paper:",
        "• The sample space is denoted by S; • C denotes the set of possible classifications of the samples; • C[s] denotes the classification associated with a sample s, and T[s] denotes the true classification of s; • p will usually denote a predicate defined on S; • A rule r is defined as a predicate - class label pair, (p, t), where t E C is called the target of r; • 7Z denotes the set of all rules; • If r = (p, t), p, will denote p and t, will denote t; • A rule r = (p,, t,) applies to a sample s if pr(s) = true and t, �4 C[s]; the resulting sample is denoted by r(s).",
        "Using the TBL framework to solve a problem assumes the existence of: • An initial class assignment.",
        "This can be as simple as the most common class label in the training set, or it can be the output of another classifier.",
        "• A set of allowable templates for rules.",
        "These templates determine the types of predicates the rules will test; they have the largest impact on the behavior of the system.",
        "• An objective function f for learning.",
        "Unlike in many other learning algorithms, the objective function for TBL will directly optimize the evaluation function.",
        "A typical example is the difference in performance resulting from applying the rule:",
        "f (r) = good (r) – bad (r) where good (r) =I {sJC [s] �4 T [s] A C [r (s)] =T[s] bad (r) =I {sJC [s] =T[s] A C [r (s)] �4 T [s]} Since we are not interested in rules that have a negative objective function value, only the rules that have a positive good (r) need be examined.",
        "This leads to the following approach:",
        "1.",
        "Generate the rules (using the rule template set) that correct at least an error (i.e. good (r) > 0), by examining all the incorrect samples (s s.t.",

        "Compute the values bad (•) for each rule r such that good(r) > f (b) , storing at each point in time the rule b that has the highest score; while computing bad(r), skip to the next rule when",
        "The system thus learns a list of rules in a greedy fashion, according to the objective function.",
        "When no rule that improves the current state of the training set beyond a preset threshold can be found, the training phase ends.",
        "During the application phase, the evaluation set is initialized with the initial class assignment.",
        "The rules are then applied sequentially to the evaluation set in the order they were learned.",
        "The final classification is the one attained when all rules have been applied."

        "As was described in the introductory section, the long training time of TBL poses a serious problem.",
        "Various methods have been investigated towards ameliorating this problem, and the following subsections detail two of the approaches.",
        "2.1.1 The Ramshaw & Marcus Approach One of the most time-consuming steps in transformation-based learning is the updating step.",
        "The iterative nature of the algorithm requires that each newly selected rule be applied to the corpus, and the current state of the corpus updated before the next rule is learned.",
        "Ramshaw & Marcus (1994) attempted to reduce the training time of the algorithm by making the update process more efficient.",
        "Their method requires each rule to store a list of pointers to samples that it applies to, and for each sample to keep a list of pointers to rules that apply to it.",
        "Given these two sets of lists, the system can then easily:",
        "1. identify the positions where the best rule applies in the corpus; and 2. update the scores of all the rules which are affected by a state change in the corpus.",
        "These two processes are performed multiple times during the update process, and the modification results in a significant reduction in running time.",
        "The disadvantage of this method consists in the system having an unrealistically high memory requirement.",
        "For example, a transformation-based text chunker training upon a modestly-sized corpus of 200,000 words has approximately 2 million rules active at each iteration.",
        "The additional memory space required to store the lists of pointers associated with these rules is about 450 MB, which is a rather large requirement to add to a system.l 2.1.2 The ICA Approach The ICA system (Hepple, 2000) aims to reduce the training time by introducing independence assumptions on the training samples that dramatically reduce the training time with the possible downside of sacrificing performance.",
        "To achieve the speedup, the ICA system disallows any interaction between the learned rules, by enforcing the following two assumptions:",
        "• Sample Independence a state change in a sample (e.g. a change in the current part-of-speech tag of a word) does not change the context of surrounding samples.",
        "This is certainly the case in tasks such as prepositional phrase attachment, where samples are mutually independent.",
        "Even for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging where intuition suggests it does not hold, it may still be a reasonable assumption to make if the rules apply infrequently and sparsely enough.",
        "'We need to note that the 200k-word corpus used in this experiment is considered small by NLP standards.",
        "Many of the available corpora contain over 1 million words.",
        "As the size of the corpus increases, so does the number of rules and the additional memory space required.",
        "• Rule Commitment there will be at most one",
        "state change per sample.",
        "In other words, at most one rule is allowed to apply to each sample.",
        "This mode of application is similar to that of a decision list (Rivest, 1987), where an sample is modified by the first rule that applies to it, and not modified again thereafter.",
        "In general, this assumption will hold for problems which have high initial accuracy and where state changes are infrequent.",
        "The ICA system was designed and tested on the task of part-of-speech tagging, achieving an impressive reduction in training time while suffering only a small decrease in accuracy.",
        "The experiments presented in Section 4 include ICA in the training time and performance comparisons.",
        "Samuel (1998) proposed a Monte Carlo approach to transformation-based learning, in which only a fraction of the possible rules are randomly selected for estimation at each iteration.",
        "The µ-TBL system described in Lager (1999) attempts to cut down on training time with a more efficient Prolog implementation and an implementation of \"lazy\" learning.",
        "The application of a transformation-based learning can be considerably sped-up if the rules are compiled in a finite-state transducer, as described in Roche and Schabes (1995)."

        "A question usually asked about a machine learning algorithm is how well it adapts to larger amounts of training data.",

        "It is obvious that the Fast TBL algorithm is much more scalable than the regular TBL displaying a linear dependency on the amount of training data, while the regular TBL has an almost quadratic dependency.",

        "Figure 2(b) shows the time spent at each iteration versus the iteration number, for the original TBL and fast TBL systems.",
        "It can be observed that the time taken per iteration increases dramatically with the iteration number for the regular TBL, while for the FastTBL, the situation is reversed.",

        "We have presented in this paper a new and improved method of computing the objective function for transformation-based learning.",
        "This method allows a transformation-based algorithm to train an observed 13 to 139 times faster than the original one, while preserving the final performance of the algorithm.",
        "The method was tested in three different domains, each one having different characteristics: part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment and text chunking.",
        "The results obtained indicate that the algorithmic improvement generated by our method is not linked to a particular task, but extends to any classification task where transformation-based learning can be applied.",
        "Furthermore, our algorithm scales better with training data size; therefore the relative speed-up obtained will increase when more samples are available for training, making the procedure a good candidate for large corpora tasks.",
        "The increased speed of the Fast TBL algorithm also enables its usage in higher level machine learning algorithms, such as adaptive boosting, model combination and active learning.",
        "Recent work (Florian et al., 2000) has shown how a TBL framework can be adapted to generate confidences on the output, and our algorithm is compatible with that framework.",
        "The stability, resistance to overtraining, the existence of probability estimates and, now, reasonable speed make TBL an excellent candidate for solving classification tasks in general."
