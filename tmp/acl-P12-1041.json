        "Many of the most difficult ambiguities in coreference resolution are semantic in nature.",

        "Also, to resolve the pronoun his to the correct antecedent Obama, we can use the knowledge that Obama has an election campaign while Jobs does not.",
        "Such ambiguities are difficult to resolve on purely syntactic or configu-rational grounds.",
        "There have been multiple previous systems that incorporate some form of world knowledge in coreference resolution tasks.",
        "Most work (Poesio et al., 2004; Markert and Nissim, 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Bergsma and Lin, 2006) addresses special cases and subtasks such as bridging anaphora, other anaphora, definite NP reference, and pronoun resolution, computing semantic compatibility via Web-hits and counts from large corpora.",
        "There is also work on end-to-end coreference resolution that uses large noun-similarity lists (Daume?",
        "III and Marcu, 2005) or structured knowledge bases such as Wikipedia (Yang and Su, 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Kobdani et al., 2011) and YAGO (Rahman and Ng, 2011).",
        "However, such structured knowledge bases are of limited scope, and, while Haghighi and Klein (2010) self-acquires knowledge about coreference, it does so only via reference constructions and on a limited scale.",
        "In this paper, we look to the Web for broader if shallower sources of semantics.",
        "In order to harness the information on the Web without presupposing a deep understanding of all Web text, we instead turn to a diverse collection of Web n-gram counts (Brants and Franz, 2006) which, in aggregate, contain diffuse and indirect, but often robust, cues to reference.",
        "For example, we can collect the co-occurrence statistics of an anaphor with various candidate antecedents to judge relative surface affinities (i.e., (Obama, president) versus (Jobs, president)).",

        "which h is a y is attested), (4) matches of distributional soft cluster ids, and (5) attested substitutions of candidate antecedents in the context of a pronominal anaphor.",

        "Since we did not need to retune on these datasets, training and tuning speed were not a bottleneck.",

        "One advantage of using Web-based features is that the Web has a surprising amount of information on even rare entities such as proper names.",
        "Our features also correct coreference for various cases of pronominal anaphora, but these corrections are harder to convey out of context.",
        "Next, we analyze the decision tree built after training the classifier (with all our Web features included).",
        "Around 30% of the decision nodes (both non-terminals and leaves) correspond to Web features, and the average error in classification at the Web-feature leaves is only around 2.5%, suggesting that our features are strongly discriminative for pairwise coreference decisions.",
        "Some of the most discriminative nodes correspond to the general co-occurrence feature for most (binned) log-count values, the Hearst-style co-occurrence feature for its zero-count value, the cluster-match feature for its zero-match value, and the R2 pronoun context feature for certain (binned) log-count values."
