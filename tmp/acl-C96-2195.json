        "The features of the EDR Electronic Dictionary can be summarized as follows:",
        "(1) A large scale that covers all the vocabulary used in ordinary writing (2) Aimed at general purpose applications without bias towards a particular application system or algorithm (3) Provided with the knowledge base required for true semantic analysis (4) A high degree of objectivity based on large volumes of text (5) Fundamental content that is highly generalized across different languages and fields",
        "The EDR Electronic Dictionary, which is composed of eleven sub-dictionaries, catalogues the lexical knowledge",
        "of Japanese and English (the Word Dictionary, the Bilingual Dictionary, and the Co-occurrence Dictionary), and has unified thesaurus-like concept classifications (the Concept Dictionary) with corpus databases (the EDR Corpus).",
        "The Concept Classification Dictionary, a sub-dictionary of the Concept Dictionary, describes the similarity relation among concepts listed in the Word Dictionary.",
        "The EDR Corpus is the source for the information described in each of the sub-dictionaries.",
        "The basic approach taken during the development of the dictionary was to avoid a particular linguistic theory and to allow for adoptability to various applications.",
