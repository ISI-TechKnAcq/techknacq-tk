        "The ultimate aim of temporal processing is the automatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, events and temporal relations within a text.",
        "However, addressing this aim is beyond the scope of an evaluation challenge and a more modest approach is appropriate.",
        "The 2007 SemEval task, TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2009), was an initial evaluation exercise based on three limited temporal ordering and anchoring tasks that were considered realistic both from the perspective of assembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.",
        "TempEval-2 is based on TempEval-1, but is more elaborate in two respects: (i) it is a multilingual task, and (ii) it consists of six subtasks rather than three.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the data that we are dealing with.",
        "Which gets us in a position to present the list of task introduced by TempEval-2, including some motivation as to why we feel that it is a good idea to split up temporal relation classification into sub tasks.",
        "We proceed by shortly describing the data resources and their creation, followed by the performance of the systems that participated in the tasks.",
        "!The Semeval-2007 task was actually known simply as TempEval, but here we use Tempeval-1 to avoid confusion."

      "heading": "2. TempEval Annotation",
      "text": [
        "The TempEval annotation language is a simplified version of TimeML.",
        "using three TimeML tags: TIMEX3, event and tlink.",
        "TIMEX3 tags the time expressions in the text and is identical to the TIMEX3 tag in TimeML.",
        "Times can be expressed syntactically by adverbial or prepositional phrases, as shown in the following example.",
        "c. Thursday evening e. later this afternoon",
        "The two main attributes of the TIMEX3 tag are type and val, both shown in the example (2).",
        "For TempEval-2, we distinguish four temporal types: time (at 2:45 p.m.), date (January 27, 1920, yesterday), duration (two weeks) and set (every Monday morning).",
        "The val attribute assumes values according to an extension of the ISO 8601 standard, as enhanced by TIMEX2.",
        "Each document has one special TIMEX3 tag, the Document Creation Time (DCT), which is interpreted as an interval that spans a whole day.",
        "The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that describe what is conventionally referred to as an eventuality.",
        "Syntactically, events are typically expressed as inflected verbs, although event nominals, such as \"crash\" in killed by the crash, should also be annotated as EVENTS.",
        "The most salient event attributes encode tense, aspect, modality and polarity information.",
        "Examples of some of these features are shown below:",
        "(3) should have bought",

        "(4) did not teach",
        "tense=\"PAST\" aspect=\"NONE\" modality=\"NONE\" polarity=\"NEG\"",
        "The relation types for the TimeML tlink tag form a fine-grained set based on James Allen's interval logic (Allen, 1983).",
        "For TempEval, the set of labels was simplified to aid data preparation and to reduce the complexity of the task.",
        "We use only six relation types including the three core relations before, after, and overlap, the two less specific relations before-or-overlap and overlap-or-after for ambiguous cases, and finally the relation vague for those cases where no particular relation can be established.",
        "Temporal relations come in two broad flavours: anchorings of events to time expressions and orderings of events.",
        "Events can be anchored to an adjacent time expression as in examples 5 and 6 or to the document creation time as in 7.",

        "In addition, determine value of the features type and val.",

        "Determine the extent of the events in a text as defined by the TimeML event tag.",
        "In addition, determine the value of the features",
        "class, tense, aspect, polarity, and modality.",
        "C. Determine the temporal relation between an event and a time expression in the same sentence.",
        "This task is further restricted by requiring that either the event syntactically dominates the time expression or the event and time expression occur in the same noun phrase.",
        "D. Determine the temporal relation between an event and the document creation time.",
        "E. Determine the temporal relation between two main events in consecutive sentences.",
        "F Determine the temporal relation between two events where one event syntactically dominates the other event.",
        "Of these tasks, C, D and E were also defined for TempEval-1.",
        "However, the syntactic locality restriction in task C was not present in TempEval-1.",
        "Task participants could choose to either do all tasks, focus on the time expression task, focus on the event task, or focus on the four temporal relation tasks.",
        "In addition, participants could choose one or more of the six languages for which we provided data: Chinese, English, French, Italian, Korean, and Spanish.",
        "We feel that well-defined tasks allow us to structure the workflow, allowing us to create task-specific guidelines and using task-specific annotation tools to speed up annotation.",
        "More importantly, each task can be evaluated in a fairly straightforward way, contrary to for example the problems that pop up when evaluating two complex temporal graphs for the same document.",
        "In addition, tasks can be ranked, allowing systems to feed the results of one (more precise) task as a feature into another task.",
        "Splitting the task into substask reduces the error rate in the manual annotation, and that merging the different subtask into a unique layer as a postprocessing operation (see figure 1) provides better",

        "Most languages used BAT, the Brandeis Annotation Tool (Verhagen, 2010), a generic web-based annotation tool that is centered around the notion of annotation tasks.",
        "With the task decomposition allowed by BAT, it is possible to structure the complex task of temporal annotation by splitting it up in as many sub tasks as seems useful.",
        "As such, BAT was well-suited for TempEval-2 annotation.",
        "We now give a few more details on the English and Spanish data, skipping the other languages for reasons that will become obvious at the beginning of section 6.",
        "The English data sets were based on TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2007), a hand-built gold standard of annotated texts using the TimeML markup scheme.",
        "However, all event annotation was reviewed to make sure that the annotation complied with the latest guidelines and all temporal relations were added according to the Tempeval-2 relation tasks, using the specified relation types.",
        "The data released for the TempEval-2 Spanish edition is a fragment of the Spanish TimeBank, currently under development.",
        "Its documents are originally from the Spanish part of the AnCora corpus (Taulé et al., 2008).",

        "In this paper, we described the TempEval-2 task within the SemEval 2010 competition.",

        "Using a subset of TimeML temporal relations, we show how temporal relations and anchorings can be annotated and identified in six different languages.",
        "The markup language adopted presents a descriptive framework with which to examine the temporal aspects of natural language information, demonstrating in particular, how tense and temporal information is encoded in specific sentences, and how temporal relations are encoded between events and temporal expressions.",
        "This work paves the way towards establishing a broad and open standard metadata markup language for natural language texts, examining events, temporal expressions, and their orderings.",
        "One thing that would need to be addressed in a follow-up task is what the optimal number of tasks is.",
        "Tempeval-2 had six tasks, spread out over six languages.",
        "This brought about some logistical challenges that delayed data delivery and may have given rise to a situation where there was simply not enough time for many systems to properly prepare.",
        "And clearly, the shared task was not successful in attracting systems to four of the six languages."
