        "Even though we have recently seen an explosive growth of interest in speech-enabled applications, there are still many problems to overcome in order to provide users with practical and profitable services.",
        "One of the long-standing problems which may often frustrate users is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error.",
        "Due to ASR error, it is barely possible to directly observe what the user said and finally figure out the true user goal.",
        "The aim of dialog state tracking is, therefore, to accurately estimate the true dialog state from erroneous observations as a dialog unfolds.",
        "In order to achieve this goal, many dialog state tracking algorithms have been developed.",
        "Few studies, however, have reported the strengths and weaknesses of each method.",
        "The Dialog State Tracking Challenge1 (DSTC) was organized to advance state-of-the-art technologies for dialog state tracking by allowing for reliable comparisons between different approaches using the same datasets.",
        "Unlike other machine learning-based empirical tasks, DSTC is also carefully designed to take into consideration diverse realistic mismatches.",
        "For instance, there are test datasets that were collected by systems using different speech recognizers, spoken language understanding (SLU) modules, and dialog managers.",
        "Also there are test datasets that were produced by similar systems but deployed at a different time (1 year later) with extended coverage.",
        "Since such mismatches between training and test data may often happen in real deployment, it is important to build a tracker which constantly shows high performance across all test datasets despite various mismatches.",
        "The aim of this paper is to describe a set of techniques used to build a robust tracker with high performance: wide-coverage and well-calibrated data selection, feature-rich discriminative model design, generalization improvement techniques and unsupervised prior adaptation.",
        "Our challenge systems are basically various combinations of those techniques.",
        "The DSTC results demonstrate the effectiveness of each technique.",

        "Since both marginal and joint representations of dialog states are important for deciding dialog actions, the challenge takes into consideration both.",
        "Each joint representation is an assignment of values to all slots.",

        "The dialog tracker receives SLU N-best hypotheses for each user turn, each with a confidence score.",
        "In general, there are a large number of values for each slot, and the coverage of N-best hypotheses is good, thus the challenge confines consideration of goals to slots and values that have been observed in an SLU output.",
        "By exploiting this aspect, the task of a dialog state tracker is to generate a set of observed slot and value pairs, with a score between 0 and 1.",

        "The first step to create a robust dialog state tracker is the use of data which covers diverse system dialog actions and user inputs with well-calibrated confidence scores.",
        "Since dialog policies can be varying according to how a dialog proceeds, it is crucial to arrange a training dialog corpus with well-balanced dialog actions.",
        "For example, group A datasets barely have implicit confirmation and heavily rely on explicit confirmation, while group B datasets have both types of confirmation.",
        "Thus a model trained on group A datasets cannot exploit implicit 3 the average score assigned to the correct item 4 the L2 norm between the vector of scores output by dialog state tracker and a vector with 1 in the position of the correct item, and 0 elsewhere",

        "If the confidence score is well-calibrated, confirmation can be skipped in the case of a hypothesis with a high confidence.",
        "On the contrary, if the quality of the confidence score is very poor, a successful dialog will only be possible via heavy use of confirmation.",
        "Thus a model trained on a well-calibrated dataset is likely to perform well on the poorly-calibrated dataset because of backup confirmation.",
        "Whereas, a model trained on the poorly-calibrated dataset will not perform well on the well-calibrated dataset due to the mismatch of the confidence score as well as the scarceness of confirmation information.",

        "Most previous approaches are based on generative temporal modeling where the current dialog state is estimated using a few features such as the current system action and N-best hypotheses with corresponding confidence scores given the estimated dialog state at the previous turn (Gasic and Young, 2011; Lee and Eskenazi, 2012; Raux and Ma, 2011; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2010; Young et al., 2010).",
        "However, several fundamental questions have been raised recently about the formulation of the dialog state update as a generative temporal model: limitation in modeling correlations between observations in different time slices; and the insensitive discrimination between true and false dialog states (Williams, 2012).",

        "Our challenge entries are tagged by their entry numbers.",
        "More detailed descriptions about each model are provided in Section 3.",
        "In fact, such limitations can be improved by adopting a discriminative approach, which enables the incorporation of a rich set of features without worrying about their interdependence (Sutton and McCallum, 2006).",
        "For example, a hypothesis that repeats with low confidence scores is likely to be a manifestation of ASR error correlations between observations in different time slices.",
        "Thus, the highest confidence score that a hypothesis has attained so far could be a useful feature in preventing repeated incorrect hypotheses from defeating the correct hypothesis (which had a higher score but was only seen once).",
        "Another useful feature could be the distribution of confidence scores that a hypothesis has attained thus far, since it may not have the same effect as having a single observation with the total score due to the potential nonlinearity of confidence scores.",
        "There are many other potentially useful features.",
        "The entire list of features used for the challenge system is found in Appendix A.",
        "In addition to the role of rich features in performance enhancement, the incorporation of rich features is also important for robust state tracking.",
        "If the tracker estimates the true state by considering various aspects of observations and prior knowledge, then the influence of differences in certain factors between datasets can be mitigated by many other factors that are retained relatively unchanged between datasets.",
        "For the challenge system, we employed a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model which is one of most powerful undirected graphical models.",
        "Unlike previous work using MaxEnt (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006) where the model is limited to maintain only the top K-best hypotheses, we amended MaxEnt to allow for the entire set of observed hypotheses to be incorporated; Several feature functions which differ only by output labels were aggregated into one common feature function so that they can share common parameters and gather their statistics together (Appendix A).",
        "This modification is also crucial for robust estimation of the model parameters since some slots such as from and to can have about 104 values but most of them are not seen in the training corpus.",
        "The effectiveness of feature-rich discriminative modeling can be observed by comparing the results of DMALL and PBM (Fig.",
        "1) which are discriminative and generative models, respectively.",
        "Note that interesting relational constraints, e.g. whether or not departure and arrival places are valid on a route, can be incorporated by adopting a structured model such as Conditional Random Field (CRF).",
        "But CRF was not used for the challenge since the bus information that was provided is not compatible with every dataset.",

        "Even though the incorporation of a set of rich features helps overcome the weaknesses of previous approaches, it also implies a risk of overfitting training datasets due to its increased capacity of function class.",
        "Overfitting is a serious hazard especially for test datasets that are severely dissimilar to training datasets.",
        "As noted above, since the test datasets of the challenge are intentionally arranged to have various mismatches, it is crucial that we prevent a model from overfitting training datasets.",
        "In the rest of this section, we describe various ways of controlling the capacity of a model.",
        "The most obvious method to control the capacity is to penalize larger weights proportional to the squared values of the weights or the absolute values of the weights.",
        "We employ the Orthant-wise Limited-memory Quasi Newton optimizer (Andrew and Gao, 2007) for L1 regularization.",
        "The weights for L1 regularization were set to be 10 and 3 for the prior features and the other features, respectively.",
        "These values were chosen through cross-validation over several values rather than doing a thorough search.",
        "A second method, which is often convenient, is to start with small weights and then stop the learning before it has time to overfit provided that it finds the true regularities before it finds the spurious regularities that are related to specific training datasets.",
        "It could be hard, however, to decide when to stop.",
        "A typical technique is to keep learning until the performance on the validation set gets worse and then stop training and go back to the best point.",
        "For the challenge systems, we applied a simpler method that is to stop the training if the average objective function change over the course of 10 previous iterations is less than 0.1, which is usually set to a much smaller number such as 10-4.",
        "In general, prediction errors can be decomposed into two main subcomponents, i.e., error due to bias and variance (Hastie et.",
        "al, 2009).",
        "It is also known that there is a tradeoff between bias and variance.",
        "If a model is flexible enough to fit the given data, errors due to bias",
        "will decrease while errors due to variance will increase.",
        "The methods stated above try to achieve less error by decreasing errors due to variance.",
        "However we cannot avoid increasing errors due to bias in this way.",
        "Thus we need a method to alleviate the tradeoff between bias and variance.",
        "System combination is one powerful way to reduce variance without raising bias.",
        "If we average models that have different forms and make different mistakes, the average will do better than the individual models.",
        "This effect is largest when the models make very different predictions from one another.",
        "We could make the models different by simply employing different machine learning algorithms as well as by training them on different subsets of the training data.",
        "The challenge system, entry3, consists of three discriminative models and one generative model (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "Entry1 and entry2 were trained on different training datasets to make them produce different predictions.",
        "DMCOND is a discriminative model trained on both train2 and train3.",

        "The idea behind this training method is to encourage the model to put more weight on dialog policy invariant features.",
        "The final component PBM is the AT&T Statistical Dialog Toolkit 5 which is one of the state-of-the-art generative model-based systems.",
        "We modified it to process implicit confirmation and incorporate the prior distribution which was estimated on the training corpus.",

        "Several approximate methods have also emerged to tackle the vast complexity of representing and maintaining belief states, e.g., partition-based approaches (Gasic and Young, 2011; Lee and Eskenazi, 2012; Williams, 2010; Young et al., 2010) and Bayesian network (BN)-based methods (Raux and Ma, 2011; Thomson and Young, 2010).",
        "A drawback of the previous generative models is that it is hard to incorporate a rich set of observation features, which are often partly dependent on one another.",
        "Moreover, the quality of the confidence score will be critical to all generative models proposed so far, since they do not usually try to handle potential nonlinearity in confidence scores.",
        "As far as discriminative models are concerned, the MaxEnt model has been applied (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006).",
        "But the model is restricted to maintaining only the top K-best hypotheses, where K is a predefined parameter, resulting in potential degradation of performance and difficulties in extending it to structured models.",
        "Finally, there is a wide range of systems that participated in Dialog State Tracking Challenge 2013: from rule-based systems to fairly complex statistical methods such as Deep Neural Networks.",
        "Since we have not only traditional generative models such as Dynamic Bayesian Network and partition-based approaches, but also newly-proposed discriminative approaches such as log-linear models, Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, the analysis of the challenge results is expected to reveal valuable lessons and future research directions."

        "The average accuracy at schedule 3 also well represents how robust a state tracker is since the test datasets are widely distributed in the dimensions of dialog policies, dialog length and the quality of user input and confidence score.",

        "Specificially, the large improvement in Joint implies that our model performs evenly well for all slots and is more robust to the traits of each slot.",
        "Furthermore, from the results we can verify the effectiveness of each technique for achieving robustness.",
        "Given the large gap between the performance of entry1 and of entry2, it is clearly shown that a model trained on a wide-coverage and well-calibrated dialog corpus can be applicable to a broad range of test datasets without much loss.",
        "Even though entry2 was trained on only 344 dialogs (the first half of train3), it already surpasses most of competing models.",

        "While our models constantly show good performance both on development sets and test sets, the performance of the other models significantly dropped off.",
        "In fact, this explains why Hybrid and Rule systems switch their positions in the Joint slot.",
        "Moreover, many other systems in the graph tail seem to be severely overfitted, resulting in poor performance on test datasets despite relatively good performance on development datasets.",
        "As expected, system combination gives rise to better accuracy without loss of robustness; entry3 clearly outperforms each of its components, i.e. entry1, entry2, DMCOND and PBM, on both development and test datasets.",
