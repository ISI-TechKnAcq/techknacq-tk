        "Vernacular content is now increasingly being published on the Internet, and the need for robust language technology applications that can process this data is high.",
        "For a language like Swahili, digital resources have become increasingly important in everyday life, both in urban and rural areas, particularly thanks to the increasing number of web-enabled mobile phone users in the language area.",
        "But most research efforts in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for African languages are still firmly rooted in the rule-based paradigm.",
        "Language technology components in this sense are usually straight implementations of insights derived from grammarians.",
        "while the rule-based approach definitely has its merits, particularly in terms of design transparency, it has the distinct disadvantage of being highly language-dependent and costly to develop, as it typically involves a lot of expert manual effort.",
        "Furthermore, many of these systems are decidedly competence-based.",
        "The systems are often tweaked and tuned towards a small set of ideal sample words or sentences, ignoring the fact that real-world language technology applications have to be principally able to handle the performance aspect of language.",
        "Many researchers in the field are quite rightly growing weary of publications that ignore quantitative evaluation on real-world data or that report incredulously high accuracy scores, excused by the erroneously perceived regularity of African languages.",
        "In a linguistically diverse and increasingly computerized continent such as Africa, the need for a more empirical approach to language technology is high.",
        "The data-driven, corpus-based approach described in this paper establishes such an alternative, so far not yet extensively investigated for African languages.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is its language independence: all that is needed is (linguistically annotated) language data, which is fairly cheap to compile.",
        "Given this data, existing state-of-the-art algorithms and resources can consequently be reused to quickly develop robust language applications and tools.",
        "Most African languages are however resource-scarce, meaning that digital text resources are few.",
        "An increasing number of publications however are showing that carefully selected procedures can indeed bootstrap language technology for Swahili (De Pauw et al., 2006; De Pauw and de Schryver, 2008), Northern Sotho (de Schryver and De Pauw, 2007) and smaller African languages (Wagacha et et al., 2007b).",
        "In this paper we outline ongoing research on the development of a parallel corpus English -Swahili.",
        "The parallel corpus is designed to bootstrap a data-driven machine translation system for the language pair in question, as well as open up possibilities for projection of annotation.",
        "We start off with a short survey of the different approaches to machine translation (Section 2) and showcase the possibility of projection of annotation (Section 3).",
        "We then concentrate on the required data collection and annotation efforts (Section 4) and describe preliminary experiments on sentence, word and morpheme alignment (Sections 5 and 6).",

        "The idea of building an application to automatically convert text from one language to an equivalent text-meaning in a second language traces its roots back to Cold War intelligence efforts in the 1950's and 60's for Russian-English text translations.",

        "The Internet brought in an interesting new dimension to the purpose of MT.",

        "While these systems provide far from perfect output, they can often give readers a sense of what is being talked about on a web page in a language (and often even character set) foreign to them.",
        "There are roughly three types of approaches to machine translation:",
        "1.",
        "Rule-based methods perform translation using extensive lexicons with morphological, syntactic and semantic information, and large sets of manually compiled rules, making them very labor intensive to develop.",

        "Research in these fields has greatly benefited from the increasing availability of parallel corpora, which are needed to bootstrap these approaches.",

        "Unsupervised approaches can be used to bootstrap annotation of a resource-scarce language (De Pauw and Wagacha, 2007; De Pauw et al., 2007a) by automatically finding linguistic patterns in large amounts of raw text.",
        "Projection of annotation attempts to achieve the same goal, but through the use of a parallel corpus.",
        "These techniques try to transport the annotation of a well resourced source language, such as English, to texts in a target language.",

        "The direct correspondence assumption coined in Hwa et al.",
        "(2002) hypothesizes that words that are aligned between source and target language, must share linguistic features as well.",
        "It therefore allows for the annotation of the words in the source language to be projected unto the text in the target language.",
        "The following general principle holds: the closer source and target language are related, the more accurate this projection can be performed.",
        "Even though lexical and structural differences between languages prevent a simple one-to-one mapping, knowledge transfer is often able to generate a well directed annotation of the target language.",
        "This holds particular promise for the annotation of dependency analyses for Swahili, as exemplified in Figure 1, since dependency grammar foroot Paka alianguka ndani ya maji subj /' pp \\ ?",
