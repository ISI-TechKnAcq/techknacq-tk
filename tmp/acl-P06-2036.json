        "Synchronous Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) are a generalization of the Context-Free Grammar (CFG) formalism to simultaneously produce strings in two languages.",
        "SCFGs have a wide range of applications, including machine translation, word and phrase alignments, and automatic dictionary construction.",
        "Variations of SCFGs go back to Aho and Ullman (1972)’s Syntax-Directed Translation Schemata, but also include the Inversion Transduction Grammars in Wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in Chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the Multi-text Grammars in Melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as Yamada and Knight (2001) and Galley et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "When viewed as a rewriting system, an SCFG generates a set of string pairs, representing some translation relation.",
        "We are concerned here with the time complexity of parsing such a pair, according to the grammar.",
        "Assume then a pair with each string having a maximum length of N, and consider an SCFG G of size IGI, with a bound of n nonterminals in the right-hand side of each rule in a single dimension, which we call below the rank of G. As an upper bound, parsing can be carried out in time O (I G I Nn+4 ) by a dynamic programming algorithm maintaining continuous spans in one dimension.",
        "As a lower bound, parsing strategies with discontinuous spans in both dimensions can take time Q (I G I Nc✓n) for unfriendly permutations (Satta and Peserico, 2005).",
        "A natural question to ask then is: What if we could reduce the rank of G, preserving the generated translation?",
        "As in the case of CFGs, one way of doing this would be to factorize each single rule into several rules of rank strictly smaller than n. It is not difficult to see that this would result in a new grammar of size at most 2 • I G I.",
        "In the time complexities reported above, we see that such a size increase would be more than compensated by the reduction in the degree of the polynomial in N. We thus conclude that a reduction in the rank of an SCFG would result in more efficient parsing algorithms, for most common parsing strategies.",
        "In the general case, normal forms with bounded rank are not admitted by SCFGs, as shown in (Aho and Ullman, 1972).",
        "Nonetheless, an SCFG with a rank of n may not necessarily meet the worst case of Aho and Ullman (1972).",
        "It is then reasonable to ask if our SCFG G can be factorized, and what is the smallest rank k < n that can be obtained in this way.",
        "This paper answers these two questions, by providing an algorithm that factorizes the rules of an input SCFG, resulting in a new, generatively equivalent, SCFG with rank k as low as possible.",
        "The algorithm works in time O (n log n) for each rule, regardless of the rank k of the factorized rules.",
        "As discussed above, in this way we achieve an improvement of the parsing time for SCFGs, obtaining an upper bound of O (I G I Nk+4) by using a parsing strategy that maintains continuous",
        "tions associated with the leaves can be produced by composing the permutations at the internal nodes.",
        "spans in one dimension.",
        "Previous work on this problem has been presented in Zhang et al.",
        "(2006), where a method is provided for casting an SCFG to a form with rank k = 2.",
        "If generalized to any value of k, that algorithm would run in time O(n2).",
        "We thus improve existing factorization methods by almost a factor of n. We also solve an open problem mentioned by Albert et al.",
        "(2003), who pose the question of whether irreducible, or simple, permutations can be recognized in time less than O(n2)."

        "We say that two such strings are synchronous if some bijective relation is given between the occurrences of the nonterminals in the two strings.",
        "A synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) is defined as a CFG, with the difference that it uses synchronous rules of the form [A1 a1, A2 a2], with A1, A2 nonterminals and a1, a2 synchronous strings.",
        "We can use production [A1 a1, A2 a2] to rewrite any synchronous strings [ry11A1ry12, ry21A2ry22] into the synchronous strings [ry11a1ry12, ry21a2ry22], under the condition that the indicated occurrences of A1 and A2 be related by the bijection associated with the source synchronous strings.",
        "Furthermore, the bijective relation associated with the target synchronous strings is obtained by composing the relation associated with the source synchronous strings and the relation associated with synchronous pair [a1, a2], in the most obvious way.",
        "As in standard constructions that reduce the rank of a CFG, in this paper we focus on each single synchronous rule and factorize it into synchronous rules of lower rank.",
        "If we view the bijective relation associated with a synchronous rule as a permutation, we can further reduce our factorization problem to the problem of factorizing a permutation of arity n into the composition of several permutations of arity k < n. Such factorization can be represented as a tree of composed permutations, called in what follows a permutation tree.",
        "A permutation tree can be converted into a set of k-ary SCFG rules equivalent to the input rule.",

        "The algorithm takes as input a permutation defined on the set 11, • • • , n}, representing a rule of some SCFG, and provides a permutation tree of arity k < n for that permutation, with k as small as possible.",
        "Permutation trees covering a given input permutation are unambiguous with the exception of sequences of binary rules of the same type (either inverted or straight) (Albert et al., 2003).",
        "Thus, when factorizing a permutation into a permutation",
        "tree, it is safe to greedily reduce a subsequence into a new subtree as soon as a subsequence is found which represents a continuous span in both dimensions of the permutation matrixl associated with the input permutation.",
        "For space reasons, we omit the proof, but emphasize that any greedy reduction turns out to be either necessary, or equivalent to the other alternatives.",
        "Any sequences of binary rules can be rearranged into a normalized form (e.g. always left-branching) as a postprocessing step, if desired.",
        "The top-level structure of the algorithm exploits a divide-and-conquer approach, and is the same as that of the well-known mergesort algorithm (Cor-men et al., 1990).",
        "We work on subsequences of the original permutation, and ‘merge’ neighboring subsequences into successively longer subsequences, combining two subsequences of length 2z into a subsequence of length 2�+1 until we have built one subsequence spanning the entire permutation.",
        "If each combination of subsequences can be performed in linear time, then the entire permutation can be processed in time O(n log n).",
        "As in the case of mergesort, this is an application of the so-called master theorem (Cormen et al., 1990).",
        "As the algorithm operates, we will maintain the invariant that we must have built all subtrees of the target permutation tree that are entirely within a given subsequence that has been processed.",
        "This is analogous to the invariant in mergesort that all processed subsequences are in sorted order.",
        "When we combine two subsequences, we need only build nodes in the tree that cover parts of both subsequences, but are entirely within the combined subsequence.",
        "Thus, we are looking for subtrees that span the midpoint of the combined subsequence, but have left and right boundaries within the boundaries of the combined subsequence.",

        "It turns out that the boundaries of the next reduction, covering a given split point, can be computed in linear time with the technique shown in function SCAN of Figure 5.",
        "We start with left and right candidate boundaries at the two points immediately to the left and right of the split point, and then repeatedly check whether the current left and right boundaries identify a permuted sequence by applying the reduction test, and move the left and right boundaries outward as necessary, as soon as ‘missing’ integers are identified outside the current boundaries, as explained below.",
        "We will show that, as we move outward, the number of possible configurations achieved for the positions of the left and the right boundaries is linearly bounded in the length of the combined subsequence (as opposed to quadratically bounded).",

        "These arrays represent the within-subsequence permutation obtained by sorting the elements of each subsequence according to the input permutation, while keeping each element within its block, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Within each subsequence, we alternate between scanning horizontally from left to right, possibly extending the top and bottom boundaries (Figure 5 lines 9 to 14), and scanning vertically from bottom to top, possibly extending the left and right boundaries (lines 20 to 26).",
        "Each extension is forced when, looking at the within-subsequence permutation, we find that some element is within the current boundaries in one dimension but outside the boundaries in the other.",
        "If the distance between vertical boundaries is larger in the input permutation than in the subsequence permutation, necessary elements are missing from the current subsequence and no reduction is possible at this step (line 18).",
        "When all necessary elements are present in the current subsequence and no further extensions are necessary to the boundaries (line 30), we have satisfied the reduction test on the input permutation, and make a reduction.",

        "Because each call to SCAN skips items scanned by previous calls, each item is scanned at most twice across an entire call to MERGE, once when scanning across a new reduction’s left boundary and once when scanning across the right boundary, guaranteeing that MERGE completes in linear time."
