        "Recently, Conditional Random Fields(CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have been successfully employed in various natural language processing tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, in our system, we use it as the basic framework and incorporate some other postprocessing measures for CWS, NER and POS tagging tasks."

        "NER is always limited by its lower recall due to the imbalanced distribution where the NONE class dominates the entity classes.",
        "Classifiers built on such dataset typically have a higher precision and a lower recall and tend to overproduce the NONE class (Kambhatla, 2006).",
        "Taking SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006 (Levow, 2006) as an example, the recall is lower about 5% than the precision for each submitted system on MSRA and CityU closed track.",
        "If we could improve NER recall but keep its relatively high precision, the overall F-measure will be improved as a result.",
        "We design two kinds of effective features: 0/1 features and non-local features to achieve this objective.",
        "Our final systems utilize these features together with the local features to perform NER task.",
        "The local features are character-based and are instantiated from the following temples: Unigram: Cn (n=-2,-1, 0, 1, 2).",
        "Bigram: CnCn+1 (n=-2,-1, 0, 1) and C-1C1.",
        "Where C0 is the current character, C1 the next character, C2 the second character after C0, C-1 the character preceding C0, and C-2 the second character before C0.",
        "In order to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution, we assign 1 to all the characters which are labeled as entity and 0 to all the characters which are labeled as NONE in training data.",
        "In such way, the class distribution can be alleviated greatly, taking Bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER training data for example, if we label the corpus with 10 classes, the class distribution is 0.81(B-PER):1.70(B-LOC):0.95(B-ORG):0.81(I-PER):0.88(I-LOC):2.87(I-ORG):0.76(E-PER):1.42(E-LOC):0.94(E-ORG):88.86(NONE), if we change the label scheme to 2 labels (0/1), the class distribution is 11.14 (entity):88.86(NONE).",
        "We train the 0/1 CRFs tagger using the local features alone.",
        "For the 0/1 features, during the training stage, they are assigned with 2-fold cross validation, and during the testing stage, they are assigned with the 0/1 tagger.",
        "Most empirical approaches including CRFs currently employed in NER task make decision only on local context for extract inference, which is based on the data independent assumption.",
        "But often this assumption does not hold because nonlocal dependencies are prevalent in natural language (including the NER task).",
        "How to utilize the non-local dependencies is a key issue in NER task.",
        "Up to now, few researches have been devoted to this issue; existing works mainly focus on using the non-local information for improving NER label consistency (Krishnan and Manning, 2006).",
        "There are two methods to use non-local information.",
        "One is to add additional edges to graphical model structure to represent the distant dependencies and the other is to encode the non-locality with non-local features.",
        "In the first approach, heuristic rules are used to find the dependencies (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) or penalties for label inconsistency are required to handset ad-hoc (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "Furthermore, high computational cost is spent for approximate inference.",
        "In order to establish the long dependencies easily and overcome the disadvantage of the approximate inference, Krishnan and Manning (2006) propose a two-stage approach using CRFs framework with extract inference.",
        "They represent the non-locality with non-local features, and extract them from the output of the first stage CRF with local context alone; then they incorporate the non-local features into the second CRF.",
        "But the features in this approach are only used to improve label consistency in European languages.",
        "Similar with their work encoding the non-local information with non-local feature, and we also exploit the non-local features under two-stage architecture.",
        "Different from their features are activated on the recognized entities coming from the first CRF, the non-local features we design are used to recall more missed entities which are seen in the training data or unseen entities but some of their occurrences being recognized correctly in the first stage, so our non-local features are activated on the raw character sequence.",
        "Different NER in European languages, where entity semantic classification is more difficult compared with boundary detection, in Chinese, the situation is opposite.",
        "So we encode different useful information for Chinese NER two subtasks: entity boundary detection and entity semantic classification.",
        "Three kinds of non-local features are designed; they are fired on the token sequences if they are matched with certain entity in the entity list in forward maximum matching (FMM) way.",
        "Token-position features (NF1): These refer to the position information (start, middle and last) assigned to the token sequence which is matched with the entity list exactly.",
        "These features enable us to capture the dependencies between the identical candidate entities and their boundaries.",
        "Entity-majority features (NF2): These refer to the majority label assigned to the token sequence which is matched with the entity list exactly.",
        "These features enable us to capture the dependencies between the identical entities and their classes, so that the same candidate entities of different occurrences can be recalled favorably, and their label consistencies can be considered too.",
        "Token-position & entity-majority features (NF3): These features capture non-local information from NF1 and NF2 simultaneously.",
        "They take into account the entity boundary and semantic class information at the same time.",
        "Figure 1 shows the flow of using non-local features under CRFs framework in two-stage architecture.",
        "The first CRF is trained with local features alone, and then we test the testing data with the first CRF and get the entities plus their type from the output.",
        "The second CRF utilizes the 0/1 features and the non-local features derived from the entity list which is merged by the output of the first CRF from the testing data and the entities extracted directly from the training data.",
        "We compare the three kinds of non-local features on MSRA and CityU closed track in SIGHAN 2006 and we find that the NF3 is the best (Mao etc, 2007).",
        "So we only incorporate the NF3 into our final NER system.",
        "We employ BIOE1 label scheme for the NER task because we found it performs better than IOB2 on Bakeoff 2006 (Levow, 2006) NER MSRA and CityU corpora.",
        "Table 1 presents the official results on the MSRA and CityU corpus.",
        "The F-measure on MSRA open track is so high just because the testing data in Bakeoff 2007 is part of its Bakeoff 2006 training dataset and we utilize this corpus for training the final CRFs classifier.",
        "The F-measure on CityU open track is not much superior to its closed track because we only use its Bakeoff 2006 corpus to train the 0/1 CRFs, but not use the Bakeoff 2006 corpus to train final classifier.",
        "Chinese Word Segmentation",
        "Table 2 lists the features we used in our CWS systems.",
        "After the raw corpus is processed by CRFs, two other post-processing measures are performed.",
        "We utilize transformation-based error-driven learning (TBL) to further improve CWS and perform consistency checking among different occurrences of a particular character sequence.",
