        "Prior discourse conditions, the relationship between the literal meaning and the common ground, and specific lexical, constructional, and intonational cues all play a role.",
        "Green and Carberry (1992, 1994) provide an extensive computational model that interprets and generates indirect answers to polar questions.",
        "Their model focuses on inferring categorical answers, making use of discourse plans and coherence relations.",
        "This paper extends such work by recasting the problem in terms of probabilistic modeling.",
        "We focus on the interpretation of indirect answers where the respondent does not answer with yes or no, but rather gives information that can be used by the hearer to infer such an answer only with some degree of certainty, as in (1).",
        "B: She is sick with the flu.",
        "In this case, whether one can move from the response to a yes or no is uncertain.",
        "Based on typical assumptions about work and illness, A might take B's response as indicating that Sue is at home, but B's response could be taken differently depending on Sue's character – B could be reproaching Sue for her workaholic tendencies, which risk infecting the office, or B could be admiring Sue's steadfast character.",
        "What A actually concludes about B's indirect reply will be based on some combination of this disparate, partially conflicting, uncertain evidence.",
        "The plan and logical inference model of Green and Carberry falters in the face of such collections of uncertain evidence.",
        "However, natural dialogues are often interpreted in the midst of uncertain and conflicting signals.",
        "We therefore propose to enrich a logical inference model with probabilistic methods to deal with such cases.",
        "This study addresses the phenomenon of indirect question-answer pairs (IQAP), such as in (1), from both empirical and engineering perspectives.",
        "First, we undertake a corpus study of polar questions in dialogue to gather naturally occurring instances and to determine how pervasive indirect answers that indicate uncertainty are in a natural setting (section 2).",
        "From this empirical base, we provide a classification of IQAPs which makes a new distinction between fully-and partially-resolving answers (section 3).",
        "We then show how inference in Markov logic networks can successfully model the reasoning involved in both types of IQAPs (section 4)."

        "(1997) found 38% of the responses were IQAPs.",
        "(This higher percentage might reflect the genre difference in the corpora used: task dialogue vs. casual conversations.)",
        "These studies, however, were not concerned with how confidently one could infer a yes or no from the response given.",
        "We therefore conducted a corpus study to analyze the types of indirect answers.",
        "We used the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (Jurafsky et al., 1997) which has been annotated for approximately 60 basic dialog acts, clustered into 42 tags.",
        "We are concerned only with direct yes/no questions, and not with indirect ones such as \"May I remind you to take out the garbage?\"",
        "(Clark, 1979; Perrault and Allen, 1980).",
        "From 200 5-minute conversations, we extracted yes/no questions (tagged \"qy\") and their answers, but discarded tag questions as well as disjunctive questions, such as in (2), since these do not necessarily call for a yes or no response.",
        "We also did not take into account questions that were lost in the dialogue, nor questions that did not really require an answer (3).",

        "Other answers such as I don't know are in category IV.",

        " – or by using a backchannel in question form (Is that right?).",
        "Finally, category VI contains dispreferred answers (Schegloff et al., 1977; Pomerantz, 1984).",
        "We hypothesized that the phenomenon we are studying would appear in categories II, III and VI.",
        "However, some of the \"na/ng\" answers are disguised yes/no answers, such as Right, I think so, or Not really, and as such do not interest us.",
        "In the case of \"sv/sd\" and \"nd\" answers, many answers include reformulation, question avoidance (see 4), or a change of framing (5).",
        "All these cases are not really at issue for the question we are addressing.",
        "A: Have you ever been drug tested?",

        "IQAP(a,/3) holds only if there is a true direct answer p to the question la}, and the questioner can infer p from 1/3} in the utterance context.",
        "The apparent emphasis on truth can be set aside for present purposes; Asher and Lascarides's notions of truth are heavily relativized to the current discourse conditions.",
        "This principle hints at two dimensions of IQAPs which must be considered, and upon which we can establish a classification: (i) the type of answer which the proffered response provides, and (ii) the basis on which the inferences are performed.",
        "The typology established here adheres to this, distinguishing between fully-and partially-resolving answers as well as between the types of knowledge used in the inference (logical, linguistic, common ground/world).",
        "An indirect answer can fully resolve a question by conveying information that stands in an inclusion relation to the direct answer: if q Ç p (or -p), then updating with the response q also resolves the question with p (or -p), assuming the questioner knows that the inclusion relation holds between q and p. The inclusion relation can be based on logical relations, as in (7), where the response is an \"over-answer\", i.e., a response where more information is given than is strictly necessary to resolve the question.",

        "Due to the slippery nature of these predicates, there is no hard-and-fast way to resolve such questions in all cases.",

        "However, satisfying these two sub-relations does not strictly entail satisfying the raising relation as well.",

        "Similarly, it seems that attributing a negative response would be misguided, though the answer is partly negative.",
        "The rest of the dialogue does not determine whether A considers this equivalent to raising, and the dialogue proceeds happily without this resolution.",

        "The relationship between the response and question is not secured by any objective world facts or conventionalized meaning, but rather is variable – contingent on specialized world knowledge concerning the dialogue participants and their beliefs.",
        "Resolving such IQAPs positively or negatively is achieved only at the cost of a degree of uncertainty: for resolution occurs against the backdrop of a set of defeasible assumptions.",
        "Table 2 is a cross-classification of the examples discussed by whether the responses are fully-or partially-resolving answers and by the types of knowledge used in the inference (logical, linguistic, world).",

        "Besides offering an accurate treatment of fully-resolved inferences, MLNs have the ability to deal with degrees of certitude.",
        "This power is required if one wants an adequate model of the reasoning involved in partially-resolved inferences.",
        "Indeed, for the successful modeling of such inferences, it is essential to have a mechanism for adding facts about the world that are accepted to various degrees, rather than categorically, as well as for updating these facts with speakers' beliefs if such information is available."

        "We have provided an empirical analysis and initial treatment of indirect answers to polar questions.",
        "The empirical analysis led to a categorization of IQAPs according to whether their answers are fully-or partially-resolving and according to the types of knowledge used in resolving the question by inference (logical, linguistic, common ground/world).",
        "The partially-resolving indirect answers injected a degree of uncertainty into the resolution of the predicate at issue in the question.",
        "Such examples highlight the limits of traditional logical inference and call for probabilistic methods.",
        "We therefore modeled these exchanges with Markov logic networks, which combine the power of first-order logic and probabilities.",
        "As a result, we were able to provide a robust model of question-answer resolution in dialogue, one which can assimilate information which is not categorical, but rather known only to a degree of certitude."
