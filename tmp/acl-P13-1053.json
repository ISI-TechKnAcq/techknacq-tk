        "In recent years, the possibility to undertake large-scale annotation projects with hundreds or thousands of annotators has become a reality thanks to online crowdsourcing methods such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and Games with a Purpose.",
        "Although these techniques open the door to a true revolution for the creation of annotated corpora, within the computational linguistics community there so far is no clear understanding of how the so-called ?wisdom of the crowds?",
        "could or should be used to develop useful annotated linguistic resources.",
        "Those who have looked into this increasingly important issue have mostly concentrated on validating the quality of multiple non-expert annotations in terms of how they compare to expert gold standards; but they have only used simple aggregation methods based on majority voting to combine the judgments of individual annotators (Snow et al., 2008; Venhuizen et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper, we take a different perspective and instead focus on investigating different aggregation methods for deriving a single collective annotation from a diverse set of judgments.",
        "For this we draw inspiration from the field of social choice theory, a theoretical framework for combining the preferences or choices of several individuals into a collective decision (Arrow et al., 2002).",
        "Our aim is to explore the parallels between the task of aggregating the preferences of the citizens participating in an election and the task of combining the expertise of speakers taking part in an annotation project.",
        "Our contribution consists in the formulation of a general formal model for collective annotation and, in particular, the introduction of several families of aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce some basic terminology and argue that there are four natural forms of collective annotation.",
        "We then focus on one of them and present a formal model for it in Section 3.",
        "We also formulate some basic principles of aggregation within this model in the same section.",
        "Section 4 introduces three families of aggregation methods: bias-correcting majority rules, greedy methods for identifying (near-)consensual coalitions of annotators, and distance-based aggre-gators.",
        "We test the former two families of aggrega-tors, as well as the simple majority rule commonly used in similar studies, in a case study on data extracted from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment in Section 5.",

        "An annotation task consists of a set of items, each of which is associated with a set of possible categories (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "The categories may be the same for all items or they may be item-specific.",
        "For instance, dialogue act annotation",
        "(Allen and Core, 1997; Carletta et al., 1997) and word similarity rating (Miller and Charles, 1991; Finkelstein et al., 2002) involve choosing from amongst a set of categories?acts in a dialogue act taxonomy or values on a scale, respectively?",
        "which remains fixed for all items in the annotation task.",
        "In contrast, in tasks such as word sense labelling (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000; Palmer et al., 2007; Venhuizen et al., 2013) and PP-attachment annotation (Rosenthal et al., 2010; Jha et al., 2010) coders need to choose a category amongst a set of options specific to each item?the possible senses of each word or the possible attachment points in each sentence with a prepositional phrase.",
        "In either case (one set of categories for all items vs. item-specific sets of categories), annotators are typically asked to identify, for each item, the category they consider the best match.",
        "In addition, they may be given the opportunity to indicate that they cannot judge (the ?don't know?",
        "or ?unclear?",
        "category).",
        "For large-scale annotation projects run over the Internet it is furthermore very likely that an annotator will not be confronted with every single item, and it makes sense to distinguish items not seen by the annotator from items labelled as ?don't know?.",
        "We refer to this form of annotation, i.e., an annotation task where coders have the option to (i) label items with one of the available categories, to (ii) choose ?don't know?, or to (iii) not label an item at all, as plain annotation.",
        "Plain annotation is the most common form of annotation and it is the one we shall focus on in this paper.",
        "However, other, more complex, forms of annotation are also possible and of interest.",
        "For instance, we may ask coders to rank the available categories (resulting in, say, a weak or partial order over the categories); we may ask them to provide a qualitative ratings of the available categories for each item (e.g., excellent match, good match, etc.",
        "); or we may ask for quantitative ratings (e.g., numbers from 1 to 100).1 We refer to these forms of annotation as complex annotation.",
        "We want to investigate how to aggregate the information available for each item once annotations by multiple annotators have been collected.",
        "In line with the terminology used in social choice theory and particularly judgment aggregation (Ar-1Some authors have combined qualitative and quantitative ratings; e.g., for the Graded Word Sense dataset of Erk et al. (2009) coders were asked to classify each relevant WordNet sense for a given item on a 5-point scale: 1 completely different, 2 mostly different, 3 similar, 4 very similar, 5 identical.",
        "row, 1963; List and Pettit, 2002), let us call an aggregation method independent if the outcome regarding a given item j only depends on the categories provided by the annotators regarding j itself (but not on, say, the categories assigned to a different item j?).",
        "Independent aggregation methods are attractive due to their simplicity.",
        "They also have some conceptual appeal: when deciding on j maybe we should only concern ourselves with what people have to say regarding j?",
        "On the other hand, insisting on independence prevents us from exploiting potentially useful information that cuts across items.",
        "For instance, if a particular annotator almost always chooses category c, then we should maybe give less weight to her selecting c for the item j at hand than when some other annotator chooses c for j.",
        "This would call for methods that do not respect independence, which we shall refer to as general aggregation.",
        "Note that when studying independent aggregation methods, without loss of generality, we may assume that each annotation task consists of just a single item.",
        "In view of our discussion above, there are four classes of approaches to collective annotation:",
        "(1) Independent aggregation of plain annota",
        "tions.",
        "This is the simplest case, resulting in a fairly limited design space.",
        "When, for a given item, each annotator has to choose between k categories (or abstain) and we do not permit ourselves to use any other information, then the only reasonable choice is to implement the plurality rule (Taylor, 2005), under which the winning category is the category chosen by the largest number of annotators.",
        "In case there are exactly two categories available, the plurality rule is also called the majority rule.",
        "The only additional consideration to make here (besides how to deal with ties) is whether or not we may want to declare no winner at all in case the plurality winner does not win by a sufficiently significant margin or does not make a particular quota.",
        "This is the most common approach in the literature (see, e.g., Venhuizen et al., 2013).",
        "(2) Independent aggregation of complex annotations.",
        "This is a natural generalisation of the first approach, resulting in a wider range of possible methods.",
        "We shall not explore it here, but only point out that in case annotators provide linear orders over categories, there is a close resemblance to classical voting the",
        "ory (Taylor, 2005); in case only partial orders can be elicited, recent work in computational social choice on the generalisation of classical voting rules may prove helpful (Pini et al., 2009; Endriss et al., 2009); and in case annotators rate categories using qualitative expressions such as excellent match, the method of majority judgment of Balinski and Laraki",
        "(2011) should be considered.",
        "(3) General aggregation of plain annotations.",

        "Some annotation tasks might be subject to integrity constraints that determine the internal consistency of an annotation.",
        "For example, if our items are pairs of words and the possible categories include synonymous and antonymous, then if item 1 is about words A and B, item 2 about words B and C, and item 3 about words A and C, then any annotation that labels items 1 and 2 as synonymous should not label item 3 as antonymous.",
        "Thus, a further desirable property that will play a role for some annotation tasks is collective rationality (Grandi and Endriss, 2011): if all individual annotations respect a given integrity constraint, then so should the collective annotation.",
        "We can think of integrity constraints as imposing top-down expert knowledge on an annotation.",
        "However, for some annotation tasks, no integrity constraints may be known to us in advance, even though we may have reasons to believe that the individual annotators do respect some such constraints.",
        "In that case, selecting one of the individual annotations in the profile as the collective annotation is the only way to ensure that these integrity constraints will be satisfied by the collective annotation (Grandi and Endriss, 2011).",
        "Of course, to do so we would need to assume that there is at least one annotator who has labelled all items (and to be able to design a high-quality aggregator in this way we should have a sufficiently large number of such annotators to choose from), which may not always be possible, particularly in the context of crowdsourcing."

        "Similarly, let Freq(X) denote the frequency of X across the entire profile.",

        "That is, the weight of annotator i for category X is equal to her relative frequency of having chosen the other category 1?X .",

        "Other tie-breaking rules (e.g., random tie-breaking) are possible.",
        "Freqi(X).",
        "Recall that Freq(X) is the relative frequency ofX in the entire profile, while Freqi(X) is the relative frequency of X in the annotation of i.",
        "Hence, if i assigns category X less often than the general population, then her weight on X-choices will be increased by the difference (and vice versa in case she assigns X more often than the population at large).",
        "For example, if you assign 1 in two out of ten cases, while in general category 1 appears in exactly 50% of all annotations, then your weight for a choice of 1 will be 1 + 0.5?",
        "0.2 = 1.3, while you weight for a choice of 0 will only be 0.7.",

        "However, by and large, the emphasis so far has been on issues such as experiment design, data quality, and costs, with little attention being paid to the aggregation methods used, which are typically limited to some form of majority vote (or taking averages if the categories are numeric).",
        "In contrast, our focus has been on investigating different aggregation methods for arriving at a collective annotation.",
        "Our work has connections with the literature on inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Agreement scores such as kappa are used to assess the quality of an annotation but do not play a direct role in constructing one single annotation from the labellings of several coders.13 The methods we have proposed, in contrast, do precisely that.",
        "Still, agreement plays a prominent role in some of these methods.",
        "In our discussion of distance-based aggregation, we suggested how agreement can be used to select a subset of annotators whose individual annotations are minimally distant from the resulting collective annotation.",
        "Our greedy consensus rule also makes use of agreement to ensure a minimum level of consensus.",
        "In both cases, the aggregators have the effect of disregarding some outlier annotators.",

        "annotators.",

        "In our approach, we do not directly rate annotators or recalibrate their annotations?rather, some outlier annotators get to play a marginal role in the resulting collective annotation as a side effect of the aggregation methods themselves.",
        "Although in our case study we have tested our aggregators by comparing their outcomes to a gold standard, our approach to collective annotation itself does not assume that there is in fact a ground truth.",
        "Instead, we view collective annotations as reflecting the views of a community of speakers.14 This contrasts significantly with, for instance, the machine learning literature, where there is a focus on estimating the hidden true label from a set of noisy labels using maximum-likelihood estimators (Dawid and Skene, 1979; Smyth et al., 1995; Raykar et al., 2010).",
        "In application domains where it is reasonable to assume the existence of a ground truth and where we are able to model the manner in which individual judgments are being distorted relative to this ground truth, social choice theory provides tools (using again maximum-likelihood estimators) for the design of aggregators that maximise chances of recovering the ground truth for a given model of distortion (Young, 1995; Conitzer and Sandholm, 2005).",
        "In recent work, Mao et al. (2013) have discussed the use of these methods in the context of crowdsourcing.",

        "However, in tasks related to linguistic knowledge and language use such an assumption seems far less justified.",

        "annotation projects.",
        "Such projects are becoming more and more common, due to the availability of online crowdsourcing methods for data annotation.",
        "Our work is novel in several respects.",
        "We have drawn inspiration from the field of social choice theory to formulate a general formal model for aggregation problems, which we believe sheds light on the kind of issues that arise when trying to build annotated linguistic resources from a potentially large group of annotators; and we have proposed several families of concrete methods for aggregating individual annotations that are more fine-grained that the standard majority rule that so far has been used across the board.",
        "We have tested some of our methods on a gold standard testset for the task of recognising textual entailment.",
        "Our aim has been conceptual, namely to point out that it is important for computational linguists to reflect on the methods used when aggregating annotation information.",
        "We believe that social choice theory offers an appropriate general methodology for supporting this reflection.",
        "Importantly, this does not mean that the concrete aggregation methods developed in social choice theory are immediately applicable or that all the axioms typically studied in social choice theory are necessarily relevant to aggregating linguistic annotations.",
        "Rather, what we claim is that it is the methodology of social choice theory which is useful: to formally state desirable properties of aggregators as axioms and then to investigate which specific aggregators satisfy them.",
        "To put it differently: at the moment, researchers in computational linguistics simply use some given aggregation methods (almost always the majority rule) and judge their quality on how they fare in specific experiments?but there is no principled reflection on the methods themselves.",
        "We believe that this should change and hope that the framework outlined here can provide a suitable starting point.",
        "In future work, the framework we have presented here should be tested more extensively, not only against a gold standard but also in terms of the usefulness of the derived collective annotations for training supervised learning systems.",
        "On the theoretial side, it would be interesting to study the axiomatic properties of the methods of aggregation we have proposed here in more depth and to define axiomatic properties of aggregators that are specifically tailored to the task of collective annotation of linguistic resources."
