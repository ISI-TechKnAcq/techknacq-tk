        "Text categorization is the task of classifying documents into a certain number of predefined categories.",
        "Many supervised learning algorithms have been applied to this area.",
        "These algorithms today are reasonably successful when provided with enough labeled or annotated training examples.",
        "For example, there are Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), Rocchio (Lewis et al., 1996), Nearest Neighbor (kNN) (Yang et al., 2002), TCFP (Ko and Seo, 2002), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1998).",
        "However, the supervised learning approach has some difficulties.",
        "One key difficulty is that it requires a large, often prohibitive, number of labeled training data for accurate learning.",
        "Since a labeling task must be done manually, it is a painfully time-consuming process.",
        "Furthermore, since the application area of text categorization has diversified from newswire articles and web pages to Emails and newsgroup postings, it is also a difficult task to create training data for each application area (Nigam et al., 1998).",
        "In this light, we consider learning algorithms that do not require such a large amount of labeled data.",
        "While labeled data are difficult to obtain, unlabeled data are readily available and plentiful.",
        "Therefore, this paper advocates using a bootstrapping framework and a feature projection technique with just unlabeled data for text categorization.",
        "The input to the bootstrapping process is a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of seed information to tell the learner about the specific task.",
        "In this paper, we consider seed information in the form of title words associated with categories.",
        "In general, since unlabeled data are much less expensive and easier to collect than labeled data, our method is useful for text categorization tasks including online data sources such as web pages, E-mails, and newsgroup postings.",
        "To automatically build up a text classifier with unlabeled data, we must solve two problems; how we can automatically generate labeled training documents (machine-labeled data) from only title words and how we can handle incorrectly labeled documents in the machine-labeled data.",
        "This paper provides solutions for these problems.",
        "For the first problem, we employ the bootstrapping framework.",
        "For the second, we use the TCFP classifier with robustness from noisy data (Ko and Seo, 2004).",
        "How can labeled training data be automatically created from unlabeled data and title words?",
        "Maybe unlabeled data don’t have any information for building a text classifier because they do not contain the most important information, their category.",
        "Thus we must assign the class to each document in order to use supervised learning approaches.",
        "Since text categorization is a task based on predefined categories, we know the categories for classifying documents.",
        "Knowing the categories means that we can choose at least a representative title word of each category.",
        "This is the starting point of our proposed method.",
        "As we carry out a bootstrapping task from these title words, we can finally get labeled training data.",
        "Suppose, for example, that we are interested in classifying newsgroup postings about specially ‘Autos’ category.",
        "Above all, we can select ‘automobile’ as a title word, and automatically extract keywords (‘car’, ‘gear’, ‘transmission’, ‘sedan’, and so on) using co-occurrence information.",
        "In our method, we use context (a sequence of 60 words) as a unit of meaning for bootstrapping from title words; it is generally constructed as a middle size of a sentence and a document.",
        "We then extract core contexts that include at least one of the title words and the keywords.",
        "We call them centroid-contexts because they are regarded as contexts with the core meaning of each category.",
        "From the centroid-contexts, we can gain many words contextually co-occurred with the title words and keywords: ‘driver’, ‘clutch’, ‘trunk’, and so on.",
        "They are words in first-order co-occurrence with the title words and the keywords.",
        "To gather more vocabulary, we extract contexts that are similar to centroid-contexts by a similarity measure; they contain words in second-order co-occurrence with the title words and the keywords.",
        "We finally construct context-cluster of each category as the combination of centroid-contexts and contexts selected by the similarity measure.",
        "Using the context-clusters as labeled training data, a Naive Bayes classifier can be built.",
        "Since the Naive Bayes classifier can label all unlabeled documents for their category, we can finally obtain labeled training data (machine-labeled data).",
        "When the machine-labeled data is used to learn a text classifier, there is another difficult in that they have more incorrectly labeled documents than manually labeled data.",
        "Thus we develop and employ the TCFP classifiers with robustness from noisy data.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews previous works.",
        "In section 3 and 4, we explain the proposed method in detail.",

        "The starting point of our method is that we have title words and collected documents.",
        "A title word can present the main meaning of each category but it could be insufficient in representing any category for text categorization.",
        "Thus we need to find words that are semantically related to a title word, and we define them as keywords of each category.",
        "The score of semantic similarity between a title word, T, and a word, W, is calculated by the cosine metric as follows:",
        "where ti and wi represent the occurrence (binary value: 0 or 1) of words T and W in i-th document respectively, and n is the total number of documents in the collected documents.",
        "This method calculates the similarity score between words based on the degree of their co-occurrence in the same document.",
        "Since the keywords for text categorization must have the power to discriminate categories as well as similarity with the title words, we assign a word to the keyword list of a category with the maximum similarity score and recalculate the score of the word in the category using the following formula: Score(W, cmax) = sim(T ax, W)+(sim(Tmax, W) −sim(Tsecon, W)) (2) where Tmax is the title word with the maximum similarity score with a word W, cmax is the category of the title word Tmax, and Tsecondmax is other title word with the second high similarity score with the word W. This formula means that a word with high ranking in a category has a high similarity score with the title word of the category and a high similarity score difference with other title words.",
        "We sort out words assigned to each category according to the calculated score in descending order.",

        "Among centroid-contexts, some contexts could not have good features of a category even though they include the keywords of the category.",
        "To rank the importance of centroid-contexts, we compute the importance score of each centroid-context.",

        "Words and contexts play complementary roles.",
        "Contexts are similar to the extent that they contain similar words, and words are similar to the extent that they appear in similar contexts (Karov and Edelman, 1998).",
        "This definition is circular.",
        "Thus it is applied iteratively using two matrices, WSM and CSM.",
        "Each category has a word similarity matrix WSMn and a context similarity matrix CSMn.",
        "In each iteration n, we update WSMn, whose rows and columns are labeled by all content words encountered in the centroid-contexts of each category and input remaining contexts.",
        "In that matrix, the cell (i ,j) holds a value between 0 and 1, indicating the extent to which the i-th word is contextually similar to the j-th word.",
        "Also, we keep and update a CSMn, which holds similarities among contexts.",
        "The rows of CSMn correspond to the remaining contexts and the columns to the centroid-contexts.",
        "In this paper, the number of input contexts of row and column in CSM is limited to 200, considering execution time and memory allocation, and the number of iterations is set as 3.",

        "Every word has some affinity to the context, and the context can be represented by a vector indicating the affinity of each word to it.",
        "3) Similarity formulae",
        "The similarity of W1 to W2 is the average affinity of the contexts that include W1 to W2, and the similarity of a context X1 to X2 is a weighted average of the affinity of the words in X1 to X2.",
        "Similarity formulae are defined as follows:",
        "The weights in formula 7 are computed as reflecting global frequency, log-likelihood factors, and part of speech as used in (Karov and Edelman, 1998).",
        "The sum of weights in formula 8, which is a reciprocal number of contexts that contain W1, is 1.",
        "4) Assigning remaining contexts to a category We decided a similarity value of each remaining context for each category using the following method: sim(X, ci) = aver[, (X, S;)ci∈C Sj∈CCci (9) In formula 9, i) X is a remaining context, ii) C={c1,c2,...,cm}is a category set, and iii) ccci ={S1 ,..., Sn}is a controid-contexts set of category ci.",

        "In our experiments, we used the micro-averaging precision as performance measure and two revised data sets: revised_NG, revised_Reuters.",
        "These data sets were revised in the same way according to Slonim’s paper as follows: In revised_NG, the categories of Newsgroups were united with respect to 10 meta-categories: five comp categories, three politics categories, two sports categories, three religions categories, and two transportation categories into five big meta-categories.",
        "The revised_Reuters used the 10 most frequent categories in the Reuters 21578 corpus under the ModApte split.",
        "As shown in Table 5, our method shows 6.65 advanced score in revised_NG and 3.2 advanced score in revised_Reuters."

        "This paper has addressed a new unsupervised or semi-unsupervised text categorization method.",
        "Though our method uses only title words and unlabeled data, it shows reasonably comparable performance in comparison with that of the supervised Naive Bayes classifier.",
        "Moreover, it outperforms a clustering method, sIB.",
        "Labeled data are expensive while unlabeled data are inexpensive and plentiful.",
        "Therefore, our method is useful for low-cost text categorization.",
        "Furthermore, if some text categorization tasks require high accuracy, our method can be used as an assistant tool for easily creating labeled training data.",
        "Since our method depends on title words and keywords, we need additional studies about the characteristics of candidate words for title words and keywords according to each data set."
