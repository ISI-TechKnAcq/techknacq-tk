        "In recent years, standardized examinations have proved a fertile source of evaluation data for language processing tasks.",
        "They are valuable for many reasons: they represent facets of language understanding recognized as important by educational experts; they are organized in various formats designed to evaluate specific capabilities; they are yardsticks by which society measures educational progress; and they affect a large number of people.",
        "Previous researchers have taken advantage of this material to test both narrow and general language processing capabilities.",
        "Among the narrower tasks, the identification of synonyms and antonyms has been studied by (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Mohammed et al., 2008; Mohammed et al., 2011; Turney et al., 2003; Turney, 2008), who used questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), Graduate Record Exams (GRE) and English as a Second Language (ESL) exams.",
        "Tasks requiring broader competencies include logic puzzles and reading comprehension.",
        "Logic puzzles drawn from the Law School Administration Test (LSAT) and the GRE were studied in (Lev et al., 2004), which combined an extensive array of techniques to solve the problems.",
        "The DeepRead system (Hirschman et al., 1999) initiated a long line of research into reading comprehension based on test prep material (Charniak et al., 2000; Riloff and The-len, 2000; Wang et al., 2000; Ng et al., 2000).",
        "In this paper, we study a new class of problems intermediate in difficulty between the extremes of synonym detection and general question answering - the sentence completion questions found on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).",
        "These questions present a sentence with one or two blanks that need to be filled in.",
        "Five possible words (or short phrases) are given as options for each blank.",
        "All possible answers except one result in a nonsense sentence.",
        "Two examples are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The questions are highly constrained in the sense that all the information necessary is present in the sentence itself without any other context.",
        "Nevertheless, they vary widely in difficulty.",
        "The first of these examples is relatively simple: the second half of the sentence is a clear description of the type of behavior characterized by the desired adjective.",
        "The second example is more sophisticated; one must infer from",
        "1.",
        "One of the characters in Milton Murayama's novel is considered because he deliberately defies an oppressive hierarchical society.",
        "(A) rebellious (B) impulsive (C) artistic (D) industrious (E) tyrannical 2.",

        "Moreover, the first, incorrect, possibility is perfectly acceptable in the context of the second clause alone; only irrelevance to the contrast between medicine and poison eliminates it.",
        "In general, the questions require a combination of semantic and world knowledge as well as occasional logical reasoning.",
        "We study the sentence completion task because we believe it is complex enough to pose a significant challenge, yet structured enough that progress may be possible.",
        "As a first step, we have approached the problem from two points-of-view: first by exploiting local sentence structure, and secondly by measuring a novel form of global sentence coherence based on latent semantic analysis.",
        "To investigate the usefulness of local information, we evaluated n-gram language model scores, from both a conventional model with Good-Turing smoothing, and with a recently proposed maximum-entropy class-based n-gram model (Chen, 2009a; Chen, 2009b).",
        "Also in the language modeling vein, but with potentially global context, we evaluate the use of a recurrent neural network language model.",
        "In all the language modeling approaches, a model is used to compute a sentence probability with each of the potential completions.",
        "To measure global coherence, we propose a novel method based on latent semantic analysis (LSA).",
        "We find that the LSA based method performs best, and that both local and global information can be combined to exceed 50% accuracy.",
        "We report results on a set of questions taken from a collection of SAT practice exams (Princeton-Review, 2010), and further validate the methods with the recently proposed MSR Sentence Completion Challenge set (Zweig and Burges, 2011).",
        "Our paper thus makes the following contributions: First, we present the first published results on the SAT sentence completion task.",
        "Secondly, we evaluate the effectiveness of both local n-gram information, and global coherence in the form of a novel LSA-based metric.",
        "Finally, we illustrate that the local and global information can be effectively fused.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the language modeling methods we have evaluated.",
        "Section 4 outlines the LSA-based methods.",
