        "The aim of any Automatic Translation project is to give a mechanical procedure for finding an equivalent expression in the target language for any sentence in the source language.",
        "The aim of any linguistic translation project is to find the corresponding structures of the languages dealt with.",

        "Structure of the dictionary",
        "Two dictionaries are needed: an idiomatic dictionary and a lexical dictionary.",
        "Both have next to each English entry the German equivalent (or equivalents) and the syntactic and semantic information needed for producing a correct German sentence (and for choosing the correct equivalent, if necessary).",
        "The lexical dictionary may, for technical reasons, be subdivided into a dictionary for words of high frequency and a dictionary for words of low frequency.",
