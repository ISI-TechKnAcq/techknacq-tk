        "However, parallel corpora are only available for few language pairs and for a small selection of domains (e.g., politics).",
        "For other language pairs and domains, monolingual comparable corpora and monolingual language processing tools may be more easily available.",
        "This has prompted researchers to investigate bilingual lexicon extraction based on monolingual corpora (see Section 2).",
        "In this paper, we present a new graph-theoretic method for bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "Two monolingual graphs are constructed based on syntactic analysis, with words as nodes and relations (such as adjectival modification) as edges.",
        "Each relation acts as a similarity source for the node types involved.",
        "All available similarity sources interact to produce one final similarity value for each pair of nodes.",
        "Using a seed lexicon, nodes from the two graphs can be compared to find a translation.",
        "Our main contributions in this paper are: (i) we present a new method, based on graph theory, for bilingual lexicon extraction without relying on resources with limited availability like parallel corpora; (ii) we show that with this graph-theoretic framework, information obtained by linguistic analysis is superior to cooccurrence data obtained without linguistic analysis; (iii) we experiment with a number ofways ofcombining different linguistic relations in extraction and present a novel method, multi-edge extraction, which is both modular and scalable; (iv) progress in bilingual lexicon extraction has been hampered by the lack of a common benchmark; we therefore publish a benchmark and the performance of MEE as a baseline for future research.",
        "The paper discusses related work in Section 2.",

        "Similarly, the method sometimes puts the antonym of the correct translation in first place.",
        "For example, the translation for swift (schnell) is in second place behind langsam (slow).",
        "Based on the syntactic relations we use, it is difficult to discriminate between antonyms and semantically similar words if their syntactic distributions are similar.",
        "Ambiguous source words also pose a problem for the system.",
        "The correct translation of square (the geometric shape) is Quadrat.",
        "However, 8 out of its top 10 translation candidates are related to the location sense of square.",
        "The other two are geometric shapes, Quadrat being listed second.",

        "bed is also ambiguous (piece of furniture vs. river bed).",
        "This introduces translation candidates from the geographical domain.",
        "As an additional source of errors, a number of bed's neighbors from the furniture sense have the German translation Bank which is ambiguous between the furniture sense and the financial sense.",
        "This ambiguity in the target language German introduces spurious translation candidates from the financial domain.",
        "Discussion.",
        "The error analysis demonstrates that most of the erroneous translations are words that are incorrect, but that are related, in some obvious way, to the correct translation, e.g. by co-hyponymy or antonymy.",
        "This suggests another application for bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "One of the main challenges facing statistical machine translation (SMT) today is that it is difficult to distinguish between minor errors (e.g., incorrect word order) and major errors that are completely implausible and undermine the users' confidence in the machine translation system.",
        "For example, at some point Google translated \"sarkozy sarkozy sarkozy\" into \"Blair defends Bush\".",
        "Since bilingual lexicon extraction, when it makes mistakes, extracts closely related words that a human user can understand, automatically extracted lexicons could be used to discriminate smaller errors from grave errors in SMT.",
        "As we discussed earlier, parallel text is not available in sufficient quantity or for all important genres for many language pairs.",
        "The method we have described here can be used in such cases, provided that large monolingual corpora and basic linguistic processing tools (e.g. POS tagging) are available.",
        "The availability of parsers is a more stringent constraint, but our results suggest that more basic NLP methods may be sufficient for bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "In this work, we have used a set of seed translations (unlike e.g., Haghighi et al.",
        "(2008)).",
        "We believe that in most real-world scenarios, when accuracy and reliability are important, seed lexica will be available.",
        "In fact, seed translations can be easily found for many language pairs on the web.",
        "Although a purely unsupervised approach is perhaps more interesting from an algorithmic point of view, the semisupervised approach taken in this paper may be more realistic for applications.",
        "In this paper, we have attempted to reimplement Rapp's system as a baseline, but have otherwise refrained from detailed comparison with previous work as far as the accuracy ofresults is concerned.",
        "The reason is that none of the results published so far are easily reproducible.",
        "While previous publications have tried to infer from differences in performance numbers that one system is better than another, these comparisons have to be viewed with caution since neither the corpora nor the gold standard translations are the same.",
        "For example, the paper by Haghighi et al.",
        "(2008) (which demonstrates how orthography and contextual information can be successfully used) reports 61.7% accuracy on the 186 most confident predictions of nouns.",
        "But since the evaluation data sets are not publicly available it is difficult to compare other work (including our own) with this baseline.",
        "We simply do not know how methods published so far stack up against each other.",
        "For this reason, we believe that a benchmark is necessary to make progress in the area of bilingual lexicon extraction; and that our publication of such a benchmark as part of the research reported here is an important contribution, in addition to the linguistically grounded extraction and the new graph-theoretical method we present."
