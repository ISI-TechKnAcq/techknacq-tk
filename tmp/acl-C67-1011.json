        "Detailed examination of this example shows that hind this particular way of making an on-line system lateract with an operator there lies a strategy, a hypothesis and a prospect.",
        "V. The strategy is at all costs to avoid post-editing; but to allow maximal preprocessing of the input text by the machine interacting with the operator, all the Question-and-answer routines being in the operator's native language.",
        "The argument against post-editing (as the U.S. Report conclusively shows) is that it is either mechanical e.g. the resolution of French gender-concord - in which case the machine itself can be programmed to do it - or it is creative and/or intuitive)in which case it cannot be done at 411 without extensive reference back to the input text; ho could interpret \"Shakespeare Overspat\", which was the title of a Russian \"Pravda\" article as translated by the U.S. Air Force computer?",
        "The real meaning was \"Shakespeare is now a back number\"), in which came the post-editor might as well have translated the whole text himself in the first place.",
        "To avoid post-editing, however, the output produced by a man-machine reactive M.T.",
        "program has either got to be a blank space (when the program fails), or a unique translation which is known to be correct.",
        "Now uniqueness of output can be brutally produced, as everybody knows,tgprogramming the machine only to print out one et any set of alternatives.",
        "Correctness, however, can only be achieved by the target-language translation having been approved beforehand by the operator, from cues which the machine gives him, or which he gives the machine - in his own language; i.e. in the source language.",
        "The real use, therefore, of the three-stage question-and-answer routine exemplified above, is that it enables an Englishman with a console but who does .8. not know any French to produce a unique and correct idiomatic French translation of an English textrprovided that he is prepared to take the trouble to pre-process the English text so that it is finally restated in a Frenchified sort of way.",
        "After this the machine can of course transcribe it into French.",
        "In other words, a machine-aided translation program basically consists - a) of programming the machine to pick up the ambiguities in the source language which the target-language will not tolerate (not the other way round) and of making the operator produce the additional information which will resolve them.",
        "Take, as example, the phrasing /for a standby force/.",
        "This looks technical and unambiguous in the English, but comparative examination of bilingual text showed that it translated into French (and in the same document) as either i)/d'une force d'urgence/ i.e./\"of an emereency force or ii) /pour une force de re'serve/ i.e. /\"for a reserve force\"/, according to sophisticated considerations of context.",
        "Therefore, when the operator types the technical term STANDBY FORCE into the machine, in order to fill up the gaps in the phrasing-frame /FOR A",
        "The operator then has to choose, and type back into the machine the alternative he wants, after which the machine can make the translation.",
        "b) way mustmhe.",
        "found of onelpting the machine to pick up,from cues in the source language, the metaphors and idioms which the target-language will not tolerate/and to assist the operator to rephrase the stretch of text concerlltd,in terms which the target-language will tolerateahe difference between idioms and metaphors is that idioms can be mechanically picked up and matched by an idiom dictionary, whereas metaphors can't.",
        "â€¢ 9'.",
        "c) Similarly again, the machine must be programmed to pick up, from the source language input, the constructions which the target-language will not tolerate, and assist the operator to transform these into constructions which the target-language will tolerate (e.g. to turm English passives into French actives, and the adjectives of English adjective-noun strings into French post-positioned preppsitional phrases).",
        "Thus the whole translating work, really, is done iithin the source language.",
        "Once you can preprocess your English input into a Frenchified shape in the respects a), b), c), above, the machine can transform this Frenchified English, ;:ith no trouble at all, into elegant French.",
        "The strategic hope, of course, is that by analysing the printouts produced by a large number of sequences of such machine-man interactions, in translating many types of texts, we shall ultimately learn how to make the machine answer, as well as ask, some of the rounds of questions, (as is already being done in a whole range of machine \"edit\" programs), so that the machine shall progressively become able to do more of the Frenchifi-cation process for itself; thus finally producing, (if the machine ever became able completely to take over) exceedingly slow but reliable machine translation, which could)subsequently again,be speeded up.",
        "Before further discussion of the extent to which this strategic hope is a real hope and hew much a mere pious aspiration, i.e. the prospect, I will now set out the hypothesis (as opposed to the strategy) of the experiment.",
        "VI.",
        "The hypothesis which the translation-model gives is the following: Translation consists of the pairing of a phrasing, P7A, in Language A, with another Rhrasing, P2BIE in Language B, in such a way that P1 Okill01400forms an analogy with PiA, in a sense of \"analogy\" which can be ostensively defined intterms of the model.",
        "Thus translating a phrasing intro another language is no different, (according to this translation-model) from defining it, producing a parallel-phrasing to it, reiterating or otherwise further specifying it, in the same languagef The advantage of the model is that unambiguous criteria of the formation of such a pairing can be given.",
        "For any response given by the operator to a machine-question will form such a pair: the first member of the pair will be the original phrasing, (in English), the second the chosen machine-specification (called by us a template) .10. also in English.",
        "Then another pair will be formed whenever the machine translates the operator's final choice of template into French; the first member of the pair in this case, will be the final template chosen, and the second member will be the translation into French, with the stressed words translated and inserted into their correct places.",
        "Then again, an intermediate pair may be formed of which each member is a template; the first member of such a pair will be a more abstract template chosen at the first round of man-machine interaction, while the second member of it will be the more concrete template chosen by the operator at the second round of man-machine interaction; and so on recursively.",
        "Any such pairing formed by the translation model, whether between English phrasing and template, or between template and template, or between template and French phrasing, we shall call a semantic square.",
        "A philosophic discussion of the notion of semantic square is given in another publication CD)â€¢ A semantic square (in terms of this model) consists of the pairing of any two linguistic sequences P1 and P2, P1 and P2 each having the following characteristics: i) each has two stressed segments (which when P1 is paired to P2, form points of the square).",
        "ii) each has these embedded in some phrasing-frame, (which, when P1 is paired to P2 forms the frame of the square).",
        "iii) each has been selected as synonymous *ith the other at least once,either by the operator or by the machine.",
        "Thus, according to the model, translation consists of sequential semantic-square forming, the sequence of semantic squares thus formed continuing until it is brought to an end by the machine printing out a square which has a target-language phrasing as its second member.",
        "To make all this clearer, let us further develop the example of man-machine interaction given above,by assuming that the phrasing to be translated is /HE WENT to the police/.",
        "To translate this, the operator types in /HE...12D to the [PAST VERB] DOUNi and chooses, at the first round of questioning, the abstract template HF COMMUNICATED WITH SONE.ANIMATE BEING .11.",
        "The first semantic square of this sequence formed by the model is thus: /HE WENT TO THE POLICE/ /HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING/.",
        "The machine then asks: DO YOU MEAN A HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY B HE TOLD-A-STORY TO SOME LISTENER C HE CONSULTED WITH SOME AUTHORITY The operator chooses A, thus forming the second semantic square in the sequence: /HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE-BEING/ /HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY/ The operator then types in the stressed word /POLICE/ (to specify the nature of the enemy), and the machine then forms the final semantic-square: /HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY/ /IL TOUT RiVgLA AUX FLICS/ \"FLICS\" having been pre-chosen by the operator's choices of template from a bilingual tree-dictionary-entry for the English word \"police\" with nodes as follows: Thus the sequence of semantic44squares formed by this operation of.",

        "LL This, stated in the briefest possible terms, is the hypothesis given by the model.",
        "Now as to the prospect of developing this line of research.",
        "The first thing to say is that the model makes clear the unsuitability of the ordinary digital computer as compared to a human being for performing translation.",
        "For in this translation-model the computer handles each phrasing of the input text as a separate unit, and forces the operator, by successive rounds of questioning, so to specify it that it can be translated unambiguously into French.",
        "But the human being, who does not treat each phrasing of a text as a separate unit, but who uses his understanding of the earlier phrasings of a text to guide him in his understanding of the later ones, does not have to ask himself nearly so many questions.",
        "A progressive learning-model of translation, then, is what is really required, rather than the present single-phrasing-matching model.",
        "On the other hand, the complexity which has to be introduced into the model to account for all the differing French translations which have to be made of a single piece of English, according to its context, this would have to be introduced into any effective M.T.",

        "There is, however, another, much deeper obstacle to developing this research, and that is that (as M.T.",
