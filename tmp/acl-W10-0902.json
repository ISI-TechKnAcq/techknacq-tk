        "Our goal is to build an end-to-end text understanding system by assembling together existing components for parsing, semantic interpretation, co-reference resolution and so on.",
        "Commonly, these components are combined in a pipeline in which each one passes forward a single best interpretation (see (a) in fig. 1).",
        "Although this approach is relatively straightforward, it can suffer from overly aggressive pruning; a component might prune those interpretations that downstream components might have been able to recognize as correct.",
        "Similarly, a component might prune an interpretation that would be validated by reading subsequent texts.",
        "The system's accuracy would almost certainly improve if it were able to delay pruning until sufficient evidence accumulates to make a principled commitment.",

        "Then, the system might choose the best interpretation at the last step of the pipeline.",
        "However, this approach is intractable due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of interpretation paths.",
        "In previous work (Kim et al., 2010), we proposed an alternative approach in which each component passes forward multiple interpretations which are compressed into an intensional representation that we call a packed graphical (PG) representation (see (c) in fig. 1).",
        "Our experiment showed that the approach could improve the interpretation accuracy considerably by delaying ambiguity resolution while avoiding combinatorial explosion.",
        "In this paper, we discuss our plan to build an end-to-end text understanding system using the PG representation.",
        "We first introduce the language interpretation system we are currently building, which produces a PG representation from the parse of each sentence.",
