        "The background of this contribution is the line of work known as DIALECTOMETRY (Se?guy, 1973; Goebl, 1982), which has made computational work popular in dialectology.",
        "The basic idea of dialectometry is simple: one acquires large samples of corresponding material (e.g., a list of lexical choices, such as the word for carbonated soft drink, which might be ?soda?, ?pop?, ?tonic?",
        "etc.)",
        "from different sites within a language area, and then, for each pair of samples, one counts (or more generally measures) the difference at each point of correspondence.",
        "The differences are summed, and, given representative and sufficiently large samples, the results characterizes the degree to which one site differs from another.",
        "Earlier work in dialectology mapped the distributions of individual items, recording lines of division on maps, so-called ISOGLOSSES, and then sought bundles of these as tell-tale indicators of important divisions between DIALECT AREAS.",
        "But as Chambers & Trudgill (1998) note, the earlier methodology is fraught with problems, many of which stem from the freedom of choice with respect to isoglosses, and their (normal) failure to ?bundle?",
        "neatly.",
        "Nerbonne (2009) notes that dialectometry improves on the traditional techniques in many ways, most of which stem from the fact that it shifts focus to AGGREGATE LEVEL of differences.",
        "Dialectometry uses large amounts of material; it reduces the subjectivity inherent in choosing isoglosses; it frequently analyzes material in ways unintended by those who designed dialect data collection efforts, including more sources of differences; and finally it replaces search for categorical overlap by a statistical analysis of differences.",
        "Dialectometry does not enjoy overwhelming popularity in dialectology, however, and one of the reasons is simply that dialectologists, but also laymen, are interested not only in the aggregate relations among sites, or even the determination of dialect areas (or the structure of other geographic influence on language variation, such as dialect continua), but are quite enamored of the details involved.",
        "Dialectology scholars, but also laymen, wish to now where ?coffee?",
        "is ordered (in English) with a labialized /k/ sound ([kwOfi]) or where in Germany one is likely to hear [p] and where [ > pf] in words such as Pfad ?path?",
        "or Pfund ?pound?.",
        "Such characteristic features are known as SHIBBOLETHS, following a famous story in the old testament where people were killed because of where they were from, which was betrayed by their inability to pronounce the initial [S] in the word ?shibboleth?",
        "(Judges 12:6).",
        "We propose a generalization of the well-known precision and",
        "recall scores, appropriate when dealing with distances, and which are designed to detect distinctive, characteristic variants when the analysis is based on numerical difference scores.",
        "We also compare our proposal to Fisher's linear discriminant, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on Dutch and German dialect data.",
        "Finally we evaluate the success of the proposal by visually examining an MDS plot showing the distances one obtains when the analysis is restricted to the features determined to be characteristic.",
        "The paper proceeds from a dialectometric perspective, but the technique proposed does not assume an aggregate analysis, only that a group of sites has been identified somehow or another.",
        "The task is then to identify characteristic features of (candidate) dialect areas."

        "Wieling and Nerbonne (2011) introduced two measures seeking to identify elements characteristic of a given group, REPRESENTATIVENESS and DISTINCTIVENESS.",
        "The intuition behind representativeness is simply that a feature increases in representativeness to the degree that it is found at each site in the group.",
        "We simplify their definition slightly as they focus on sound correspondences, i.e. categorical variables, while we shall formulate ideas about features in general.",
        "where f is a feature (in their case sound correspondence) in question, g is the set of sites in a given cluster, and gf denotes the set of sites where feature f is observed.",
        "As Wieling (2012) notes, if one construes the sites in the given group as ?relevant documents?",
        "and features as ?queries?, then this definition is equivalent to RECALL in information retrieval (IR).",
        "The intuition behind distinctiveness is similar to that behind IR's PRECISION, which measures the fraction of positive query responses that identify relevant documents.",
        "In our case this would be the fraction of those sites instantiating a feature that are indeed in the group we seek to characterize.",
        "In the case of groups of sites in dialectological analysis, however, we are dealing with groups that may make up significant fractions of the entire set of sites.",
        "Wieling and Nerbonne therefore introduced a correction for ?chance instantiation?.",
        "This is derived from the relative size of the group",
        "where, G is the set of sites in the larger area of interest.",
        "As a consequence, smaller clusters are given larger scores than clusters that contain many objects.",
        "Distinctiveness may even fall below zero, but these will be very uninteresting cases ?",
        "those which occur relatively more frequently outside the group under consideration than within it.",
        "Critique There are two major problems with the earlier formulation which we seek to solve in this paper.",
        "First, the formulation, if taken strictly, applies only to individual values of categorical features, not to the features themselves.",
        "Second, many dialectological analyses are based on numerical measures of feature differences, e.g., the edit distance between two pronunciation transcriptions or the distance in formant space between two vowel pronunciations (Leinonen, 2010).",
        "We seek a more general manner of detecting characteristic features below, i.e. one that applies to features, and not just to their (categorical) values and, in particular, one that can work hand in hand with numerical measures of feature differences."

        "Since dialectometry is built on measuring differences, we assume this in our formulation, and we seek those features which differ little within the group in question and a great deal outside that group.",
        "We focus on the setting where we examine one candidate group at a time, seeking features which characterize it best in distinction to elements outside the group.",
        "We assume therefore, as earlier, a group g that we are examining consisting of |g |sites among a larger area of interest G with |G |sites including the sites s both within and outside g. We further explicitly assume a measure of difference d between sites, always with respect to a given feature",

        "As a result, we use the measure",
        "where df represents all distance values with respect to feature f (the formula is not simplified for the sake of clarity).",
        "We emphasize that we normalized the difference scores for each feature separately.",
        "Had we normalized with respect to all the differences, we would only have transformed the original problem in a linear fashion.",

        "See illustration in Figure 1.",
        "For this work we used a difference function that finds the aggregated minimum Levenshtein distance between two sites as calculated by Gabmap (Nerbonne et al., 2011).",

        "The mean of categorical features, for example, is undefined.",

        "Application of computational methods in dialectology and historical linguistics is still not generally accepted.",
