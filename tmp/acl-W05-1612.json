        "It is shown that human labelers can perform this task with a high agreement (F-score of .95).",

        "Traditionally, Natural Language Generation (NLG) is defined as the automatic production of “meaningful texts in ( ... ) human language from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information” [Reiter and Dale, 2000, xvii].",
        "Recently, there is an increased interest in NLG applications that produce meaningful text from meaningful text rather than from abstract meaning representations.",
        "Such applications are sometimes referred to as text-to-text generation applications (e.g., [Chandrasekar and Bangalore, 1997], [Knight and Marcu, 2002], [Lapata, 2003]), and may be likened to earlier revision-based generation strategies, e.g. [Robin, 1994] [Callaway and Lester, 1997].",
        "Text-to-text generation is often motivated from practical applications such as summarization, sentence simplification, and sentence compression.",
        "One reason for the interest in such generation systems is the possibility to automatically learn text-to-text generation strategies from corpora of parallel text.",
        "In this paper, we take a closer look at sentence fusion [Barzilay, 2003][Barzilay et al., 1999], one of the interesting variants in text-to-text generation.",
        "A sentence fusion module takes related sentences as input, and generates a single sentence summarizing the input sentences.",
        "The general strategy described in [Barzilay, 2003] is to first align the dependency structures of the two input sentences to find the common information in both sentences.",
        "On the basis of this alignment, the common information is framed into an fusion tree (i.e., capturing the shared information), which is subsequently realized in natural language by generating all traversals of the fusion tree and scoring their probability using an n-gram language model.",
        "Of the sentences thus generated the one with the lowest (length normalized) entropy is selected.",
        "Barzilay and co-workers apply sentence fusion in the context of multi-document summarization, where the input sentences typically come from multiple documents describing the same event, but sentence fusion seems to be useful for other applications as well.",
        "In question-answering, for instance, sentence fusion could be used to generate more complete answers.",
        "Many current QA systems use various parallel answer-finding strategies, each of which may produce an N-best list of answers (e.g., [Maybury, 2004]) In response to a question like “What causes RSI?” one potential answer sentence could be: RSI can be caused by repeating the same sequence of movements many times an hour or day.",
        "And another might be: RSI is generally caused by a mixture of poor ergonomics, stress and poor posture.",
        "These two incomplete answers might be fused into a more complete answer such as: RSI can be caused by a mixture of poor ergonomics, stress, poor posture and by repeating the same sequence of movements many times an hour or day.",
        "The same process of sentence fusion can of course be applied to the whole list of N-best answers in order to derive a more specific, or even the most specific, answer, akin to taking the union of a number of sets.",
        "Likewise, we can rely on sentence fusion to derive a more general answer, or even the most general one (cf. intersection), in the hope that this will filter out irrelevant parts of the answer.",
        "Arguably, such applications call for a generalized version of sentence fusion, which may have consequences for the various components (alignment, fusion and generation) of the sentence fusion pipeline.",
        "At the alignment level, we would like to have a better understanding of how words and phrases in the input sentences relate to each other.",
        "Rather than a binary choice (align or not), one might want to distinguish more fine-grained relations such as overlap (if two phrases share some but not all of their content), paraphrases (if two phrases express the same information in different ways), entailments (if one phrase entails the other, but not vice versa), etc.",
        "Such an alignment strategy would be especially useful for applications such as question answering and information extraction, where it is often important to know whether two sentences are paraphrases or stand in an entailment relation [Dagan and Glickman, 2004].",
        "In the fusion module, we are interested in the possibilities to generate various kinds of fusions depending on the relations between the respective sentences, e.g., selecting the more specific or the more general phrase depending on whether the fusion tree is an intersection or a union one.",
        "Finally, the generation may be more complicated in the generalized version, and it is an interesting question whether the use of language models is equally suitable for different kinds of fusion.",
        "In this paper, we will explore some of these issues related to a generalized version of sentence fusion.",
        "We start with the basic question whether it is possible at all to reliably align sentences, including different potential relations between words and phrases (section 2).",
        "We then present our ongoing work on sentence fusion, describing the current status and performance of the alignment algorithm (section 3), as well as the fusion and generation components (section 4).",
        "We end with discussion and description of future plans in section 5."

        "1. v equals v' iff STR(v) and STR(v') are literally identical (abstracting from case and word order) Example: “a small and a large boa-constrictor” equals “a large and a small boa-constrictor”; 2. v restates v' iffSTR(v) is aparaphrase of STR(v') (same information content but different wording), Example: “a drawing of a boa-constrictor snake” restates “a drawing of a boa-constrictor”; 3. v specifies v' iff STR(v) is more specific than STR(v'), Example: “the planet B 612” specifies “the planet”; 4. v generalizes v' iff STR(v') is more specific than STR(v),",

        "Their alignment algorithm is less refined, and there is only type of alignment and hence output (only restatements), but their mapping of aligned trees to a word lattice (or FSA) seems worthwhile to explore in combination with the approach we have proposed here.",
        "One of the issues that remains to be addressed in future work is the effect of parsing errors.",
        "Such errors were not manually corrected, but during manual alignment, however, we sometimes found that substrings could not be properly aligned because the parser failed to identify them as syntactic constituents.",
        "The repercussions of this for the generation should be investigated by comparing the results obtained here with alignments on perfect parses.",
        "Furthermore, our work on automatic alignment so far only concerned the alignment of nodes, not the determination of the relation type.",
        "We intend to address this task with machine learning, initially relying on shallow features such as the length of the respective token strings and the amount of overlap.",
        "It is also clear that more work is needed on merging and surface realization.",
        "One possible direction here is to exploit the relatively rich linguistic representation of the input sentences (POS tags, lemmas and dependency structures), for instance, along the lines of [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000].",
        "Yet another issue concerns the type of text material.",
        "The sentence pairs from our current corpus are relatively close, in the sense that there is usually a 1 to-1 mapping between sentences, and both translations more or less convey the same information.",
        "Although this seems a good starting point to study alignment, we intend to continue with other types of text material in future work.",
        "For instance, in extending our work to the actual output of a QA system, we expect to encounter sentences with far less overlap.",
        "Of particular interest to us is also whether sentence fusion can be shown to improve the quality of QA system output."
