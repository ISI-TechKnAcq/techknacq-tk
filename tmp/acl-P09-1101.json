        "Answers are just some examples of large repositories of information powered by individuals who voluntarily contribute their time and talents.",
        "Some NLP projects are now using this idea, notably the 'ESP Game' (von Ahn 2004), a data collection effort presented as a game in which players label images from the Web.",
        "This paper presents an extension of this collaborative volunteer ethic in the area of dialogue annotation.",
        "For dialogue researchers, the prospect of using volunteer annotators from the Web can be an attractive option.",
        "The task of training annotators can be time-consuming, expensive, and (if inter-annotator agreement turns out to be poor) risky.",
        "Getting Internet volunteers for annotation has its own pitfalls.",
        "Dialogue annotation is often not very interesting, so it can be difficult to attract willing participants.",
        "Experimenters will have little control over the conditions of the annotation and the skill of the annotators.",
        "Training will be minimal, limited to whatever an average Web surfer is willing to read.",
        "There may also be perverse or uncomprehending users whose answers may skew the data.",
        "This project began as an exploratory study about the intuitions of language users with regard to dialogue segmentation.",
        "We wanted information about how language users perceive dialogue segments, and we wanted to be able to use this information as a kind of gold standard against which we could compare the performance of an automatic dialogue segmenter.",
        "For our experiment, the advantages of Internet annotation were compelling.",
        "We could get free data from as many language users as we could attract, instead of just two or three well-trained experts.",
        "Having more respondents meant that our results could be more readily generalised to language users as a whole.",
        "We expected that multiple users would converge upon some kind of uniform result.",
        "What we found (for this task at least) was that large numbers of volunteers show very strong tendencies that correspond well to expert opinion, and that these patterns of agreement are surprisingly resilient in the face of noisy input from some users.",
        "We also gained some insights into the way that people perceived dialogue segments."

        "While much work in dialogue segmentation centers around topic (e.g. Galley et al.",
        "2003, Hsueh et al.",
        "2006, Purver et al.",
        "2006), we decided to examine dialogue at a more finegrained level.",
        "The level of analysis that we have chosen corresponds most closely to adjacency pairs (after Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974), where a segment is made of matched sets of utterances from different speakers (e.g. question/answer or suggest/accept).",
        "We chose to segment dialogues this way in order to improve dialogue act tagging, and we think that examining the back-and-forth detail of the mechanics of dialogue will be the most helpful level of analysis for this task.",
        "The back-and-forth nature of dialogue also appears in Clark and Schaefer's (1989) influential work on contributions in dialogue.",
        "In this view, two-party dialogue is seen as a set of cooperative acts used to add information to the common ground for the purpose of accomplishing some joint action.",
        "Clark and Schaefer map these speech acts onto contribution trees.",
        "Each utterance within a contribution tree serves either to present some proposition or to acknowledge a previous one.",
        "Accordingly, each contribution tree has a presentation phase and an acceptance phase.",
        "Participants in dialogue assume that items they present will be added to the common ground unless there is evidence to the contrary.",
        "However, participants do not always show acceptance of these items explicitly.",
        "Speaker B may repeat Speaker's A's information verbatim to show understanding (as one does with a phone number), but for other kinds of information a simple 'uh-huh' will constitute adequate evidence of understanding.",
        "In general, less and less evidence will be required the farther on in the segment one goes.",
        "In practice, then, segments have a tailing-off quality that we can see in many dialogues.",
        "Table 1 shows one example from Verbmobil-2, a corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues.",
        "(A description of this corpus appears in Alexandersson 1997.)",
        "A segment begins when WJH brings a question to the table (utterances 1 and 2 in our example), AHS answers it (utterance 3), and WJH acknowledges the response (utterance 4).",
        "At this point, the question is considered to be resolved, and a new contribution can be issued.",
        "WJH starts a new segment in utterance 5, and this utterance shows features that will be familiar to dialogue researchers: the number of words increases, as does the incidence of new words.",
        "By the end of this segment (utterance 8), AHS only needs to offer a simple 'okay' to show acceptance of the foregoing.",
        "Our work is not intended to be a strict implementation of Clark and Schaefer's contribution trees.",
        "The segments represented by these units is what we were asking our volunteer annotators to find.",
        "Other researchers have also used a level of analysis similar to our own.",
        "Jonsson's (1991) initiative-response units is one example.",
        "Taking a cue from Mann (1987), we decided to describe the behaviour in these segments using an atomic metaphor: dialogue segments have nuclei, where someone says something, and someone says something back (roughly corresponding to adjacency pairs), and satellites, usually shorter utterances that give feedback on whatever the nucleus is about.",
        "For our annotators, the process was simply to find the nuclei, with both speakers taking part, and then attach any nearby satellites that pertained to the segment.",
        "We did not attempt to distinguish nested adjacency pairs.",
        "These would be placed within the same segment.",
        "Eventually we plan to modify our system to recognise these nested pairs."

        "The discussion of results will follow the two foci of the project: first, some comments about the aggregation of the volunteer data, and then some comments about the segmentation itself.",
        "A combination of factors appear to have contributed to the success of this method, some involving the nature of the task itself, and some involving the nature of aggregated group opinion, which has been called 'the wisdom of crowds' (for an informal introduction, see Surowiecki 2004).",
        "The fact that annotator responses were aggregated means that no one annotator had to perform particularly well.",
        "We noticed a range of styles among our annotators.",
        "Some annotators agreed very well with the expert opinion.",
        "A few annotators seemed to mark utterances in near-random ways.",
        "Some 'casual annotators' seemed to drop in, click only a few of the most obvious boundaries in the dialogue, and then submit the form.",
        "This kind of behaviour would give that annotator a disastrous individual score, but when aggregated, the work of the casual annotator actually contributes to the overall picture provided by the group.",
        "As long as the wrong responses are randomly wrong, they do not detract from the overall pattern and no volunteers need to be dropped from the sample.",
        "It may not be surprising that people with language experience tend to arrive at more or less the same judgments on this kind of task, or that the aggregation of the group data would normalise out the individual errors.",
        "What is surprising is that the judgments of the group, aggregated in this way, correspond more closely to expert opinion than (in many cases) the best individual annotators.",
        "The concept of segmentation as described here, including the description of nuclei and satellites, appears to be one that annotators can grasp even with minimal training.",
        "The task of segmentation here is somewhat different from other classification tasks.",
        "Annotators were asked to find segment boundaries, making this essentially a two-class classification task where each utterance was marked as either a boundary or not a boundary.",
        "It may be easier for volunteers to cope with fewer labels than with many, as is more common in dialogue tasks.",
        "The comparatively low perplexity would also help to ensure that volunteers would see the annotation through.",
        "One of the outcomes of seeing annotator opinion was that we could examine and learn from cases where the annotators voted overwhelmingly contrary to expert opinion.",
        "This gave us a chance to learn from what the human annotators thought about language.",
        "Even though these results do not literally come from one person, it is still interesting to look at the general patterns suggested by these results.",
        "'let's see': This utterance usually appears near boundaries, but does it mark the end of a segment, or the beginning of a new one?",
        "We tended to place it at the end of the previous segment, but human annotators showed a very strong tendency to group it with the next segment.",
        "This was despite an example on the training page that suggested joining these utterances with the previous segment.",
        "Topic: The segments under study here are different from topic.",
        "The segments tend to be smaller, and they focus on the mechanics of the exchanges rather than centering around one topic to its conclusion.",
        "Even though the annotators were asked to mark for adjacency pairs, there was a distinct tendency to mark longer units more closely pertaining to topic.",
        "Table 3 shows one example.",
        "We had marked the space between utterances 2 and 3 as a boundary; volunteers ignored it.",
        "It was slightly more common for annotators to omit our boundaries than to suggest new ones.",
        "The average segment length was 3.64 utterances for our volunteers, compared with 3.59 utterances for experts.",
        "Areas of uncertainty: At certain points on the chart, opinion seemed to be split as one or more potential boundaries presented themselves.",
        "This seemed to happen most often when two or more of the same speech act appeared sequentially, e.g. two or more questions, information-giving statements, or the like."

        "We drew a number of conclusions from this study, both about the viability of our method, and about the outcomes of the study itself.",
        "First, it appears that for this task, aggregating the responses from a large number of anonymous volunteers is a valid method of annotation.",
        "We would like to see if this pattern holds for other kinds of classification tasks.",
        "If it does, it could have tremendous implications for dialogue-level annotation.",
        "Reliable results could be obtained quickly and cheaply from large numbers of volunteers over the Internet, without the time, the expense, and the logistical complexity of training.",
        "At present, however, it is unclear whether this volunteer annotation technique could be extended to other classification tasks.",
        "It is possible that the strong agreement seen here would also be seen on any two-class annotation problem.",

        "that is a good idea",
        "Second, it appears that the concept of segmentation on the adjacency pair level, with this description of nuclei and satellites, is one that annotators can grasp even with minimal training.",
        "We found very strong agreement between the aggregated group answers and the expert opinion.",
        "We now have a sizable amount of information from language users as to how they perceive dialogue segmentation.",
        "Our next step is to use these results as the corpus for a machine learning task that can duplicate human performance.",
        "We are considering the Transformation-Based Learning algorithm, which has been used successfully in NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging (Brill 1995) and dialogue act classification (Samuel 1998).",
        "TBL is attractive because it allows one to start from a marked up corpus (perhaps the Trigger, as the best-performing trivial baseline), and improves performance from there.",
        "We also plan to use the information from the segmentation to examine the structure of segments, especially the sequences of dialogue acts within them, with a view to improving a dialogue act tagger."
