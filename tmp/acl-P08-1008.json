        "The PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) workshop series (see www.pascal-network.",
        "org/Challenges/RTE3/) has been a catalyst for recent research in developing systems that are able to detect when the content of one piece of text necessarily follows from the content of another piece of text (Dagan et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "This ability is seen as a fundamental component in the solutions for a variety of natural language problems such as question answering, summarization, and information extraction.",
        "In addition to the main entailment task, the most recent Challenge, RTE-3, contained a second optional task that extended the main task in two ways.",
        "The first extension was to require systems to make three-way entailment decisions; the second extension was for systems to return a justification or explanation of how its decision was reached.",
        "In the main RTE entailment task, systems report whether the hypothesis is entailed by the text.",
        "The system responds with YES if the hypothesis is entailed and NO otherwise.",
        "But this binary decision conflates the case when the hypothesis actually contradicts the text – the two could not both be true – with simple lack of entailment.",
        "The three-way entailment decision task requires systems to decide whether the hypothesis is entailed by the text (YES), contradicts the text (NO), or is neither entailed by nor contradicts the text (unknown).",
        "The second extension required a system to explain why it reached its conclusion in terms suitable for an eventual end user (i.e., not system developer).",
        "Explanations are one way to build a user's trust in a system, but it is not known what kinds of information must be conveyed nor how best to present that information.",
        "RTE-3 provided an opportunity to collect a diverse sample of explanations to begin to explore these questions.",
        "This paper analyzes the extended task results, with the next section describing the three-way decision subtask and Section 3 the justification subtask.",

        "While the level of agreement among human annotators as to the correct answer for an entailment pair was within expected bounds, the test set was found to be too small to reliably distinguish among systems' three-way accuracy scores.",

        "Comments from the judges did include some common themes.",

        "The extended task used the RTE-3 main task test set of entailment pairs as its test set.",
        "This test set contains 800 text and hypothesis pairs, roughly evenly split between pairs for which the text entails the hypothesis (410 pairs) and pairs for which it does not (390 pairs), as defined by the reference answer key released by RTE organizers.",
        "RTE uses an \"ordinary understanding\" principle for deciding entailment.",
        "The hypothesis is considered entailed by the text if a human reading the text would most likely conclude that the hypothesis were true, even if there could exist unusual circumstances that would invalidate the hypothesis.",
        "It is explicitly acknowledged that ordinary understanding depends on a common human understanding of language as well as common background knowledge.",
        "The extended task also used the ordinary understanding principle for deciding contradictions.",
        "The hypothesis and text were deemed to contradict if a human would most likely conclude that the text and hypothesis could not both be true.",
        "The answer key for the three-way decision task was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) using annotators who had experience as TREC and DUC assessors.",
        "NIST assessors annotated all 800 entailment pairs in the test set, with each pair independently annotated by two different assessors.",
        "The three-way answer key was formed by keeping exactly the same set of YES answers as in the two-way key (regardless of the NIST annotations) and having NIST staff adjudicate assessor differences on the remainder.",
        "This resulted in a three-way answer key containing 410 (51%)",
        "YES answers, 319 (40%) unknown answers, and 72 (9%) no answers.",
        "Eight different organizations participated in the three-way decision subtask submitting a total of 12 runs.",
        "A run consists of exactly one response of YES, no, or unknown for each of the 800 test pairs.",
        "Runs were evaluated using accuracy, the percentage of system responses that match the reference answer.",
        "Figure 1 shows both the overall accuracy of each of the runs (numbers running along the top of the graph) and the accuracy as conditioned on the reference answer (bars).",
        "The conditioned accuracy for YES answers, for example, is accuracy computed using just those test pairs for which YES is the reference answer.",
        "The runs are sorted by decreasing overall accuracy.",
        "Systems were much more accurate in recognizing entailment than contradiction (black bars are greater than white bars).",
        "Since conditioned accuracy does not penalize for overgeneration of a response, the conditioned accuracy for unknown is excellent for those systems that used unknown as their default response.",

        "In contrast, the systems responded correctly for 50% (2449/4920) of the cases when yes was the reference answer and for 61% (2345/3816) of the cases when unknown was the reference answer.",
        "Textual entailment is evaluated assuming that there is a single correct answer for each test pair.",
        "This is a simplifying assumption used to make the evaluation tractable, but as with most NLP phenomena it is not actually true.",
        "It is quite possible for two humans to have legitimate differences of opinions (i.e., to differ when neither is mistaken) about whether a hypothesis is entailed or contradicts, especially given annotations are based on ordinary understanding.",
        "Since systems are given credit only when they respond with the reference answer, differences in an-notators' opinions can clearly affect systems' accuracy scores.",
        "The RTE main task addressed this issue by including a candidate entailment pair in the test set only if multiple annotators agreed on its disposition (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "The test set also conflated agreement = .91 contains 800 pairs so an individual test case contributes only 1/800 = 0.00125 to the overall accuracy score.",

        "Each cell in the table gives the raw count before adjudication of the number of test cases that were assigned that combination of annotations.",
        "Agreement is then computed as the percentage of matches when a NIST judge's no or unknown annotation matched a no two-way reference answer.",

        "Typical disagreements involve granularity of place names and amount of background knowledge assumed.",
        "Example disagreements concerned whether Hollywood was equivalent to Los Angeles, whether East Jerusalem was equivalent to Jerusalem, and whether members of the same political party who were at odds with one another were 'opponents'.",
        "RTE organizers reported an agreement rate of about 88% among their annotators for the two-way task (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "The 90% agreement rate between the NIST judges and the two-way answer key probably reflects a somewhat larger amount of disagreement since the test set already had RTE annotators' disagreements removed.",

        "Table 3 shows the three-way agreement between the two NIST annotators.",
        "As above, the table gives the raw counts before adjudication and agreement is computed as percentage of matching annotations.",

        "Just as annotator agreement declines as the set of possible answers grows, the inherent stability of the accuracy measure also declines: accuracy and agreement are both defined as the percentage of exact matches on answers.",
        "The increased uncertainty three-way agreement = .83 when moving from two-way to three-way decisions significantly reduces the power of the evaluation.",
        "With the given level of annotator agreement and 800 pairs in the test set, in theory accuracy scores could change by as much as 136 (the number of test cases for which annotators disagreed) x0.00125 = .17 by using a different choice ofannotator.",
        "The maximum difference in accuracy scores actually observed in the submitted runs was 0.063.",
        "Previous analyses of other evaluation tasks such as document retrieval and question answering demonstrated that system rankings are stable despite differences of opinion in the underlying annotations (Voorhees, 2000; Voorhees and Tice, 2000).",
        "The differences in accuracy observed for the three-way task are large enough to affect system rankings, however.",

        "ABCDEFGHKIJL.",
        "How then to proceed?",
        "Since the three-way decision task was motivated by the belief that distinguishing contradiction from simple non-entailment is important, reverting back to a binary decision task is not an attractive option.",
        "Increasing the size of the test set beyond 800 test cases will result in a more stable evaluation, though it is not known how big the test set needs to be.",
        "Defining new annotation rules in hopes of increasing annotator agreement is a satisfactory option only if those rules capture a characteristic of entailment that systems should actually embody.",
        "Reasonable people do disagree about entailment and it is unwise to enforce some arbitrary definition in the name of consistency.",
        "Using unknown as the reference answer for all entailment pairs on which annotators disagree may be a reasonable strategy: the disagreement itself is strong evidence that neither of the other options holds.",
        "Creating balanced test sets using this rule could be difficult, however.",
        "Following this rule, the RTE-3 test set would have 360 (45%) yes answers, 64 (8%) no answers, and 376 (47%) unknown answers, and would induce the ranking ABCDEHIJGKFL.",

        "The RTE-3 extended task provided an opportunity to examine systems' abilities to detect contradiction and to provide explanations of their reasoning when making entailment decisions.",
        "True contradiction was rare in the test set, accounting for approximately 10% of the test cases, though it is not possible to say whether this is a representative fraction for the text sources from which the test was drawn or simply a chance occurrence.",
        "Systems found detecting contradiction difficult, both missing it when it was present and finding it when it was not.",
        "Levels of human (dis)agreement regarding entailment and contradiction are such that test sets for a three-way decision task need to be substantially larger than for binary decisions for the evaluation to be both reliable and sensitive.",
        "The justification task as implemented in RTE-3 is too abstract to make an effective evaluation task.",
        "Textual entailment decisions are at such a basic level of understanding for humans that human users don't want explanations at this level of detail.",
        "User backgrounds have a profound effect on what presentation styles are acceptable in an explanation.",
        "The justification task needs to be more firmly situated in the context of a real user task so the requirements of the user task can inform the evaluation task."
