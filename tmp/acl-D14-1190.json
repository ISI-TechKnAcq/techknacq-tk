        "Multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997) has been widely used in Natural Language Processing.",
        "Most of these learning methods are aimed for Domain Adaptation (Daum?e III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009), where we hypothesize that we can learn from multiple domains by assuming similarities between them.",
        "A more recent use of multi-task learning is to model annotator bias and noise for datasets labelled by multiple annotators (Cohn and Specia, 2013).",
        "The settings mentioned above have one aspect in common: they assume some degree of positive correlation between tasks.",
        "In Domain Adap-tation, we assume that some ?general?, domain-independent knowledge exists in the data.",
        "For annotator noise modelling, we assume that a ?ground truth?",
        "exists and that annotations are some noisy deviations from this truth.",
        "However, for some settings these assumptions do not necessarily hold and often tasks can be anti-correlated.",
        "For these cases, we need to employ multi-task methods that are able to learn these relations from data and correctly employ them when making predictions, avoiding negative knowledge transfer.",
        "An example of a problem that shows this behaviour is Emotion Analysis, where the goal is to automatically detect emotions in a text (Strappa- rava and Mihalcea, 2008; Mihalcea and Strappa-rava, 2012).",
        "This problem is closely related to Opinion Mining (Pang and Lee, 2008), with similar applications, but it is usually done at a more fine-grained level and involves the prediction of a set of labels (one for each emotion) instead of a single label.",
        "While we expect some emotions to have some degree of correlation, this is usually not the case for all possible emotions.",
        "For instance, we expect sadness and joy to be anti-correlated.",
        "We propose a multi-task setting for Emotion Analysis based on a vector-valued Gaussian Process (GP) approach known as coregionalisation ( ?",
        "Alvarez et al., 2012).",
        "The idea is to combine a GP with a low-rank matrix which encodes task correlations.",
        "Our motivation to employ this model is three-fold: ?",
        "Datasets for this task are scarce and small so we hypothesize that a multi-task approach will results in better models by allowing a task to borrow statistical strength from other tasks; ?",
        "The annotation scheme is subjective and very fine-grained, and is therefore heavily prone to bias and noise, both which can be modelled easily using GPs; ?",
        "Finally, we also have the goal to learn a model that shows sound and interpretable correlations between emotions.",
        "2 Multi-task Gaussian Process Regression Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) are a Bayesian kernelised framework considered the state-of-the-art for regression.",

        "Inspecting the eigenvalues of the learned matrix allows us to empirically determine its resulting rank.",

        "SVM performs better on disgust, while GP performs better on fear.",
        "standard scores are more spread over the full support of response values, i.e., [0, 100].",
        "Since our GP model employs a Gaussian likelihood, it is effectively minimising a squared-error loss.",
        "The SVM model, on the other hand, uses hinge loss, which is linear beyond the margin envelope constraints.",
        "This affects the treatment of outlier points, which attract quadratic cf. linear penalties for the GP and SVM respectively.",
        "Therefore, when training scores are more uniformly distributed (which is the case for fear), the GP model has to take the high scores into account, resulting in broader coverage of the full support.",
        "For disgust, the scores are much more peaked near zero, favouring the 1801 more narrow coverage of the SVM.",
        "More importantly, Figure 2 also shows that both SVM and GP predictions tend to exhibit a Gaussian shape, while the true scores show an exponential behaviour.",
        "This suggests that both models are making wrong prior assumptions about the underlying score distribution.",
        "For SVMs, this is a non-trivial issue to address, although it is much easier for GPs, where we can use a different likelihood distribution, e.g., a Beta distribution to reflect that the outputs are only valid over a bounded range.",
        "Note that non-Gaussian likelihoods mean that exact inference is no longer tractable, due to the lack of conjugacy between the prior and likelihood.",
        "However a number of approximate inference methods are appropriate which are already widely used in the GP literature for use with non-Gaussian likelihoods, including expectation propagation (Jyl?anki et al., 2011), the Laplace approximation (Williams and Barber, 1998) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (Adams et al., 2009).",
        "4.4 Training Set Influence We expect multi-task models to perform better for smaller datasets, when compared to single-task models.",
        "This stems from the fact that with small datasets often there is more uncertainty associated with each task, a problem which can be alleviated using statistics from the other tasks.",
        "To measure this behaviour, we performed an additional experiment varying the size of the training sets, while using 100 sentences for testing.",
        "Figure 3 shows the scores obtained.",
        "As ex-pected, for smaller datasets the single-task models are outperformed by ICM, but their performance become equivalent as the training set size increases.",
        "SVM performance tends to be slightly worse for most sizes.",
        "To study why we obtained an outlier for the single-task model with 200 sen-tences, we inspected the prediction values.",
        "We found that, in this case, predictions for joy, surprise and disgust were all around the same value.",
        "6 For larger datasets, this effect disappears and the single-task models yield good predictions.",
        "5 Conclusions and Future Work This paper proposed an multi-task approach for Emotion Analysis that is able to learn correlations 6 Looking at the predictions for smaller datasets, we found the same behaviour, but because the values found were near the mean they did not hurt the Pearson's score as much.",

        "and anti-correlations between emotions.",
        "Our formulation is based on a combination of a Gaussian Process and a low-rank coregionalisation model, using a richer parameterisation that allows the learning of fine-grained task similarities.",
        "The proposed model outperformed strong baselines when applied to a news headline dataset.",
        "As it was discussed in Section 4.3, we plan to further explore the possibility of using non-Gaussian likelihoods with the GP models.",
        "Another research avenue we intend to explore is to employ multiple layers of metadata, similar to the model proposed by Cohn and Specia (2013).",
        "An example is to incorporate the dataset provided by Snow et al. (2008), which provides multiple non-expert emotion annotations for each sentence, obtained via crowdsourcing.",
        "Finally, another possible extension comes from more advanced vector-valued GP models, such as the linear model of coregionalisation ( ?",
