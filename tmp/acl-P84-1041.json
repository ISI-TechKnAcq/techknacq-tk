        "The undisputed favorite application for natural language interfaces has been data base query.",
        "Why?",
        "The reasons range from the relative simplicity of the task, including shallow semantic processing, to the potential real-world utility of the resultant system.",
        "Because of such reasons, the data base query task was an excellent paradigmatic problem for computational linguistics, and for the very same reasons it is now time for the field to abandon its protective cocoon and progress beyond this rather limiting task.",
        "But, one may ask, what task shall then become the new paradigmatic problem?",
        "Alas, such question presupposes that a single, universally acceptable, syntactically and semantically challenging task exists..",
        "I will argue that better progress can be made by diversification and focusing on different theoretically meaningful problems, with some research groups opting to investigate issues arising from the development of integrated multi-purpose systems."

        "Consider, for example, the following update request to an employee-record data base: \"Smith should work with the marketing team and Jones with sales\" First, the internal ellipsis in the coordinate structure is typical of such requests, but is mostly absent from most DB queries.",
        "However, let us assume that such constructions present no insurmountable problems.",
        "so that we can address an equally fundamental issue: What action should the system take?",
        "Should Smith be deleted from sales and added to marketing (and vice versa for Jones)?",
        "Or, should Smith and Jones remain fixed points while all other sales and marketing employees are swapped?",
        "As Kaplan and Davidson [3] point out, one can postulate heuristics to ameliorate the problem.",
        "They proposed a minimal mutilation criterion, whereby the action entailing the smallest change to the",
        "adherence to data base query as a unifying task.",
        "I am still actively working in the area, and to some extent expect to continue doing so.",
        "The practical applications are immense, but theoretical breakthroughs require fresh ideas and more challenging problems.",
        "Hence I advocate a switch based on scientific research criteria, rather than practical applicability or engineering significance.",
        "data base is preferred.",
        "However, their bag of tricks fails miserably when confronted with examples such as: \"The sales building should house the marketing people and vice versa\" Applying the above heuristic, the bewildered system will prefer to uproot the two buildings, swap them, and lay them on each other's foundations.",
        "Then, only two DB records need to be changed.",
        "Such absurdities can only be forestalled if a semantic model of the underlying domain is built and queried, one that models actions, including their preconditions and consequences, and knows about objects, relations, and entailments.",
        "So, data base update presents many difficult issues not apparent in the simpler data base query problem.",
        "Why not, then, select this as the paradigmatic task?",
        "My only objection is to the definite article the--I advocate data base update as one of several theoretically significant tasks with major practical utility that should be selected.",

        "if possible, be able to build upon past work, rather than addressing a completely disjoint set of problems.",

        "For instance, an automated poetry comprehension device fails to meet this criterion.",

        "The task should be computationally tractable and grounded in an external validation test.",
        "Interfaces to as yet non-existent systems.",
        "or ones that must wait for radically new hardware (e.g., connectionist machines) before they can be implemented fail to meet this criterion.",
        "However, data base query interfaces met this criterion admirably.",
        "3.",
        "The task should motivation investigation of a set of language phenomena of recognizable theoretical significance that can be addressed from a computational standpoint.",
        "Ideally, the task should focus on restricted instances of a general and difficult phenomenon to encourage progress towards initial solutions that may be extended to (or may suggest) solutions to the general problem.",

        "command dialogs differ from data base queries in many important ways beyond the obvious differences in surface syntactic structure.",

        "through a single uniform natural language interface.",
        "The integration of multiple discourse goals and need to transfer information across contexts and subtasks present an additional layer of problems mostly at the dialog structure level -- that are absent from interfaces to single-task, single-function backends.",
        "The possible applications meeting the criteria have not by any means been enumerated exhaustively above.",
        "However, these reflect an initial set, most of which have received some attention of late from the computational linguistics community, and all appear to define theoretically and practically fruitful areas of research."
