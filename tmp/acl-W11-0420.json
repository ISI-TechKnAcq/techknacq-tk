        "Event-based temporal inference is a fundamental natural language technology aimed at determining the temporal anchoring and relative temporal ordering between events in text.",
        "It supports a wide range of natural language applications such as Information Extraction (Ji, 2010), Question Answering (Harabagiu and Bejan, 2005; Harabagiu and Bejan, 2006) and Text Summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2001; Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "Creating consistently annotated domain-independent data sufficient to train automatic systems has been the bottleneck.",
        "While low-level temporal annotation tasks such as identifying events and time expressions are relatively straightforward and can be done with high consistency, high-level tasks necessary to eventually arrange events in a document in a temporal order have proved to be much more challenging.",
        "Among these high-level tasks, the task of annotating the temporal relation between main events stands out as probably the most challenging.",
        "This task was the only task in the TempEval campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2009; Verhagen et al., 2010) to deal with inter-sentential temporal relations, and also the only one to directly tackle event ordering.",
        "The idea is that events covered in an article are scattered in different sentences, with some, presumably important ones, expressed as predicates in prominent positions of a sentence (i.e. the \"main event\" of the sentence).",
        "By relating main events from different sentences of an article temporally, one could get something of a chain of important events from the article.",
        "This task, in both previously reported attempts, one for English (Verhagen et al., 2009) and the other for Chinese (Xue and Zhou, 2010), has the lowest inter-annotator agreement (at 65%) among all tasks focusing on annotating temporal relations.",
        "Verhagen et al.",
        "(2009) attribute the difficulty, shared by all tasks annotating temporal relations, mainly to two factors: rampant temporal vagueness in natural language and the fact that annotators are not allowed to skip hard-to-classify cases.",
        "Xue and Zhou (2010) take a closer look at this task specifically.",
        "They report that part of the difficulty comes from \"wrong\" main events (in the sense that they are not main events in the intended sense) being selected in the preparation step.",
        "This step is a separate task upstream of the temporal relation task.",
        "The \"wrong\" main events produced in this step become part of event pairs whose temporal relation it makes no sense to annotate, and often is hard-to-classify.",
        "The reason \"wrong\" main events get selected is because the selection is based on syntactic criteria.",
        "In fact, these syntactic criteria produce results so counter-intuitive that this seemingly simple preparation task only achieves 74% inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Another part of the difficulty comes from mechanical pairing of main events for temporal relation annotation.",
        "Simply pairing up main events from adjacent sentences oversimplifies the structure within an article and is prone to produce hard-to-classify cases for temporal relation annotation.",
        "Both causes point to the need for a deeper level of text analysis to inform temporal annotation.",
        "For this, Xue and Zhou (2010) suggest introduction of discourse structure as annotated in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) into temporal relation annotation.",
        "So the previous two reports, taken together, seem to suggest that the reason this task is especially challenging is because the difficulty associated with temporal vagueness in natural language, which is shared by all tasks dealing with temporal relation, is compounded by the problem of having to annotate farfetched pairs that should not be annotated, which is unique for the only task dealing with inter-sentential temporal relations.",
        "These two problems are the foci of our experiment done on Chinese data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the annotation scheme; in Section 3, we describe the annotation procedure; in Section 4 we report and discuss the experiment results.",
        "And finally we conclude the paper."

        "As stated in the introduction, there are two problems to be addressed in our experiment.",
        "The first problem is that \"wrong\" main events get identified and main events that do not bear any relation are paired up for temporal annotation.",
        "To address this problem, we follow the suggestion by Xue and Zhou (2010), namely using a PDTB-style discourse structure to pick out and pair up main events.",
        "We believe that adopting a discourse-constrained approach to temporal annotation will not only improve annotation consistency but also increase the Informativeness Value of the annotated data, under the assumption that temporal relations that accord with the discourse structure are more valuable in conveying the overall information of a document.",
        "Since there is no Chinese data annotated with PDTB-style discourse structure available, we have to develop our own.",
        "The scheme for this step is described in Section 2.1.",
        "The second problem is that there is too much temporal vagueness in natural language with respect to the temporal classification scheme.",
        "Since we cannot change the way natural language works, we try to model the classification scheme after the data it is supposed to classify.",
        "The scheme for the temporal annotation is covered in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.",
        "2.1 Discourse-constrained selection of main events and their pairs",
        "The PDTB adopts a lexically grounded approach to discourse relation annotation (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "Based on discourse connectives like \"since\", \"and\", and \"however\", discourse relation is treated as a predicate taking two abstract objects (AO's) (such as events, states, and propositions) as arguments.",
        "For example, in the sentence below, \"since\" is the lexical anchor of the relation between Arg1 and Arg2 (example from Prasad et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "(1) Since [arg2 McDonald's menu prices rose this year], [Argi the actual decline may have been more].",
        "This notion is generalized to cover discourse relations that do not have a lexical anchor, i.e. implicit discourse relations.",
        "For example, in the two-sentence sequence below, although no discourse connective is present, a discourse relation similar to the one in (1) is present between Arg1 and Arg2 (example from Prasad et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "(2) [Argi Some have raised their cash positions to record levels].",
        "[arg2 High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls].",
        "Based on this insight, we have fashioned a scheme tailored to linguistic characteristics of Chinese text.",
        "The linguistic characteristics of Chinese text relevant to discussion here can be illustrated with the following sentence.",
        "according to reports , Dongguan Customs in total accept company contract record 8400 plus cl , compare pilot before slight exist increase , company respond/response well/good, generally acknowledge accept/acceptance \"According to reports, [AO1 Dongguan District Customs acceptede1 more than 8400 records of company contracts], [aG2 (showinge2) a slight increase from before the pilot].",
        "[AO3Companies respondede3 well], [AO4 generally acknowledginge4 acceptance].\"",
        "One feature is that it is customary to have complex ideas packed into one sentence in Chinese.",
        "The sentence above reports on how a pilot program worked in Dongguan City.",
        "Because all that is said is about the pilot program, it is perfectly natural to include it all in a single sentence in Chinese.",
        "Intuitively though, there are two different aspects of how the pilot program worked: the number of records and the response from the affected companies.",
        "To report the same facts in English, it is probably more natural to break them down into two sentences, but in Chinese, not only are they merely separated by comma, but also there is no connective relating them.",
        "Another feature is that grammatical relation between comma-separated chunks within a sentence is not always clear.",
        "In the above sentence, for instance, although the grammatical relations between ao1 and ao 2, and between ao 3 and ao4 are clear in the English translation (i.e. the first in each pair is the main clause and the second an adjunct), it is not at all clear in the original.",
        "This is the result of several characteristics of Chinese, for example, there is no inflectional clues on the verb to indicate its grammatical function in the sentence.",
        "Based on these features of Chinese text, we have decided to use punctuation as the main potential indicator for discourse relations: the annotator is asked to judge, at every instance of comma, period, colon and semi-colon, if it is an indicator for discourse relation; if both chunks separated by the punctuation are projections of a predicate, then there is a discourse relation between them.",
        "Applying this scheme to the sentence in (3), we have four abstract objects as marked up in the example.",
        "To determine the exact text span of each argument of a relation, we adopt the Minimality Principle formulated in Prasad et al.",
        "(2007): only as many clauses and/or sentences should be included in an argument selection as are minimally required and sufficient for the interpretation of the relation.",
        "Applying this principle to the sentence in (3), we can delimit the three sets of discourse relations as follows: ao1-ao2, (ao1,ao2)-(ao3,ao4), and ao3-ao4.",
        "Selection of main events is done on the level of the simplex abstract object, with one main event per simplex AO.",
        "The main event corresponds to the predicate heading the simplex AO.",
        "In (3), there are four simplex AO's, ao 1 4 ( which further form two complex AO's, (ao1,ao2) and (ao3,ao4)).",
        "The anchors for the four main events are the underlined verbs labeled as \"e1-4\".",
        "Pairing up the main events is done on the level of discourse relation.",
        "In the case of a relation only involving simplex AO's, the main events of the two AO's pair up; in the case of a relation involving complex AO's, the discourse relation is distributed among the simplex AO's to form main event pairs.",
        "For example, with the discourse relation (ao1,ao2)-(ao3,ao4), four pairs of main events are formed: e1-e3, e1-e4, e2-e3, and e2-e4.",
        "This gets tedious fast as the number of simplex AO's in a complex AO increases; in this experiment, the annotator relies on her discretion in such cases.",
        "This problem should be addressed in a more elegant way in the future.",
        "It is worth noting that in addition to picking out right main events and event pairs for temporal annotation, this scheme also broadens the coverage of the task.",
        "In the old scheme based on syntactic criteria, there is a stipulation: one main event per sentence.",
        "Because the new discourse-constrained scheme is tailored to the characteristics of Chinese text, it is able to expose more main events (in the intended sense) to temporal annotation.",
        "By modifying the six-value scheme used in Tem-pEval (containing before, overlap, after, before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after and vague), our classification scheme has seven values in it: before, overlap, after, not-before, not-after, groupie, and irrelevant.",
        "The values \"not-before\" and \"not-after\" are equivalent to \"overlap-or-after\" and \"before-or-overlap\" in the TempEval scheme.",
        "The reason we made this seemingly vacuous change is because we found that the old values were used for two different purposes by annotators.",
        "In addition to their intended use, i.e. to capture indeterminacy between the two simplex values, they were also used to label a specific case of \"overlap\".",
        "An example of such misuse of the value \"before-or-overlap\" is presented below:",
        "local Chinese judge , until at present , already exist close 20 cl local Chinese fig] W& tm » hold the post judicial official.",
        "\"The first local ethnic Chinese judge [e1 assumed] the office in 1996; up until now, there have been close to 20 ethnic Chinese locals [e2 holding] the posts of judicial officials.\"",
        "The reason for such use is probably because it represents two alternative ways of looking at the temporal relation between the two events : either e1 is before the later bulk of e2 or e1 overlaps the beginning tip of e2.",
        "To avoid such misuses, we made the above change.",
        "This value is set up for two events whose temporal relation to each other is unclear, but are known to happen within the same temporal range.",
        "For example, the temporal relation between the events represented by the underlined verbs should be classified as \"groupie\".",

        "In this example, the common range shared by the two events is expressed in the form of a time expression, \"4 ft WA\" (\"yesterday and today\"), but it does not have to be the case.",
        "It can be in the form of another event (e.g., \"I^IÊiicfcôM't'\" (\"during the process of project construction\")), or another entity with a time stamp (e.g., \"A2im M\" (\"in the Eighth Five-year Plan period\")).",
        "It should be noted that the linguistic phenomenon captured by this value can occur in a situation where the internal temporal relation between two events can be classified with another value.",
        "So ideally, this value should be set up as a feature parallel to the existent classification scheme.",
        "But due to technical restrictions imposed on our experiment, we grouped it with all the others and instructed the annotators to use it only when none of the five more specific values applies.",
        "We substituted this value for the old one \"vague\" because it is too vague.",

        "If the relation between two events is temporally relevant, we should try to characterize it in some way; if too many relations are temporally relevant but too vague to fit into the classification scheme (comfortably), then the adequacy of the scheme is questionable.",

        "One annotator classified the relation as \"before\", obviously thinking of the event of dispatching fighter jets as e1; had he considered the event of dispatching fighter jets and bombing the rebel positions, the event being described by the clause, the value would have easily been \"overlap\".",
        "Since displaying the single-word event anchor sometimes leads annotators astray, this step probably should be skipped.",
        "Doing so also simplifies the annotation process.",
        "As pointed out above, the value \"overlap\" is quite a troubling character in the classification scheme: it is both the most-used and probably the least well-defined.",
        "Annotation data show that when it is confused with \"after\", \"before\", \"not-after\", and \"not-before\", it usually involves a perceptually punctual event (\"pp-event\" henceforth) and a perceptually lasting event (\"pl-event\" henceforth), and the issue is whether the pp-event coincides with one of the temporal edges of the pl-event.",
        "If it does, then the value is \"overlap\"; otherwise, it is \"after\" /\"before\" .",
        "And on top of it is the factor of how sure one is of the issue: if one is sure, either way, the value is \"overlap\"/\"after\" /\"before\" ; otherwise, it is \"notafter\" /\"not-before\" .",

        "\"In addition, in the South America Cup, Brazilian Women's national team totally [e1 annihilated] all their opponents and [e2 ascended] the throne of champion.\"",
        "In this example, e2 is the pp-event and e1 is the pl-event.",
        "Depending on when one thinks e2 happened, either as soon as the last match ended or at the later medal ceremony, (and if the former, whether there is temporal overlap between eland e2), it is classified as either \"before\" or \"overlap; and if one is unsure, it can be classified as \"not-after\".",
        "Such cases again raise the same question as the drastically uneven distribution of values shown in Table 2: Does the current classification scheme slice the temporal pie the right way?",
        "Let us make a poster child out of \"overlap\" : it seems to both impose too stringent a condition and not make enough distinction.",
        "It imposes too stringent a condition on those cases like (8) to which whether there is temporal overlap seems beside the point.",
        "At the same time, it does not make enough distinction for cases like (4), in which an event does share one edge of another event temporally: once such cases are classified as \"overlap\", the specific information regarding the edge is lost.",
        "Such information could be very useful in temporal inference.",
        "Since it is infeasible to annotate the temporal relation between all events in an article, temporal inference is needed to expand the scope of temporal annotation.",
        "For example, if it is known from annotation that e1 is before e2 and e2 is before e3, then it can be inferred e1 is before e3.",
        "In the case of \"overlap\", whenever it is one of the premises, no inference can be made, but if the \"edge\" information is supplied, some inferences are possible.",
        "To make finer-grained distinctions in the classification scheme runs counter to the conventional wisdom that a coarser-grained scheme would do a better job handling vagueness.",
        "But our experiment has proven the conventional wisdom wrong: our seven-value system achieved much higher agreement than the old six-value system.",
        "So the key is not fewer, but better, distinctions, \"better\" in the sense that they characterize the data in a more intuitive and insightful way.",
        "Temporal relation in natural language is \"too\" vague only when we judge it against a system of temporal logic, in fact, we think the right word to describe temporal relation in natural language is \"flexible\": it is as precise as the situation calls for.",
        "To characterize the flexibility better, for starters, \"overlap\" needs to be restructured for reasons put forth above, and \"not-before\" and \"not- after\" should be discarded since they obviously do not carry weight.",
        "A major contributor to uncertainty and disagreement in annotation is subjective temporal reference.",
        "Subjective temporal reference is made based on the author's perspective of the temporal axis, for example, \"4A\" (\"today\"), \" @ I \" (\"at present), and \"ii*\" (\"past\").",
        "In this group, references with a fixed span do not constitute a problem once the point of utterance is determined (e.g. literal use of \"today\", \"this month\"); it is those with an elastic temporal span that cause disagreement.",
        "For example, \"at present\" can have a span of a second, or several minutes, or a couple of hours, or even years depending on the context.",
        "When an event modified with this type of temporal expression is paired with another event modified with direct reference to a point/span on the temporal axis (i.e. with an objective reference), annotation becomes tricky.",
        "The event pair e1-e2 in the two-sentence sequence below is such an example.",

        "This is taken from a piece written in 1997.",
        "In the context, it is clear that the contrast is between the situation before the opening-up of China and the situation about 20 years later.",
        "So it is reasonable to assume that the year 1992 falls inside the span of what the author considered nowadays; at the same time, it seems also reasonable to assume a narrow interpretation of \"94\" (\"nowadays\") that does not include the year 1992 in the span.",
        "These two interpretations would result in \"overlap\" and \"after\" respectively, and actually did so in our experiment.",
        "There are also extreme cases in which objective and subjective temporal references come in direct conflict.",
