        "Equation (1) then reduces to the familiar ML formulation.",

        "When there is no sufficient statistic of fixed dimension, MAP estimation, like ML estimation, is a much more difficult problem because the posterior density is not expressible in terms of a fixed number of parameters and cannot be maximized easily.",
        "For both finite mixture density and hidden Markov model, the lack of a sufficient statistic of fixed dimension is due to the underlying hidden process, i.e. a multinomial model for the mixture and a Markov chain for an HMM.",
