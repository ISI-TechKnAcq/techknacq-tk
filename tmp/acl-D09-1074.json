        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems rely on a training corpus consisting of sentences in the source language and their respective reference translations to the target language.",
        "These parallel sentences are used to perform automatic word alignment, and extract translation rules with associated probabilities.",
        "Typically, a parallel training corpus is comprised of collections of varying quality and relevance to the translation problem of interest.",
        "For example, an SMT system applied to broadcast conversational data may be trained on a corpus consisting mostly of United Nations and newswire data, with only a very small amount of in-domain broadcast news/conversational data.",
        "In this case, it would be desirable to down-weigh the out-of-domain data relative to the in-domain data during the rule extraction and probability estimation.",
        "Similarly, it would be good to assign a lower weight to data of low quality (e.g., poorly aligned or incorrectly translated sentences) relative to data of high quality.",
        "In this paper, we describe a novel discriminative training method that can be used to estimate a weight for each sentence in the training bitext so as to optimize an objective function - expected translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) - on a held-out development set.",
        "The training bitext typically consists of millions of (parallel) sentences, so in order to ensure robust estimation we express each sentence weight as a function of sentence-level features, and estimate the parameters of this mapping function instead.",
        "Sentence-level features may include the identifier of the collection or genre that the sentence belongs to, the number of tokens in the source or target side, alignment information, etc.",
        "The mapping from features to weights can be implemented via any differentiable function, but in our experiments we used a simple per-ceptron.",
        "Sentence weights estimated in this fashion are applied directly to the phrase and lexical counts unlike any previously published method to the author's knowledge.",
        "The tuning framework is developed for phrase-based SMT models, but the tuned weights are also applicable to the training of a hierarchical model.",
        "In cases where the tuning set used for corpus weight estimation is a close match to the test set, this method yields significant gains in TER, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) scores over a state-of-the-art hierarchical baseline.",

        "The relevant portions of the parallel text were given a higher integer weight in GIZA++ word alignment.",
        "Similar effect may be achieved by replicating the relevant subset in the training data.",
        "Lu et al.",
        "(2007) also proposed training adapted translation models which were interpolated with a model trained on the entire parallel text.",
        "Snover et al.",
        "(2008) used cross-lingual information retrieval to identify possible bias-rules to improve the coverage on the source side.",
        "These rules may cover source phrases for which no translations were learned from the available parallel text.",
        "Koehn and Schroeder (2007) described a procedure for domain adaptation that was using two translation models in decoding, one trained on in-domain data and the other on out-of-domain data.",
        "Phrase translation scores from the two models where combined in a log-linear fashion, with weights estimated based on minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on a designated tuning set.",
        "The method described in this paper can also be viewed as data filtering or (static) translation adaptation, but it has the following advantages over previously published techniques:",
        "1.",
        "The estimated corpus weights are discriminative and are computed so as to directly optimize an MT performance metric on a predefined development set.",
        "Unlike the domain adaptation technique in (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), which also estimates the adaptation parameters discriminatively, our proposed method does not require a manual specification of the in-domain and out-of-domain training data collections.",
        "Instead, it automatically determines which collections are most relevant to the domain of interest, and increases their weight while decreasing the weight assigned to less relevant collections.",
        "2.",
        "All sentences in the parallel corpus can influence the translation model, as opposed to filtering/discarding data.",
        "However, the proposed method can still assign very low weights to parts of the corpus, if it determines that it helps improve MT performance.",
        "3.",
        "The framework used for estimating the corpus weights can be easily extended to support discriminative alignment link-level weights, thus allowing the system to automatically identify which portions of the training sentences are most useful.",
        "Naturally, as with any method, the proposed technique has certain limitations.",
        "Specifically, it is only concerned with influencing the translation rule probabilities via the corpus weights; it does not change the set of rules extracted.",
        "Thus, it is unable to add new translation rules as in Snover et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Also, it can potentially lead to parameter over-fitting, especially if the function that maps sentence features to weights is complex and based on a large number of parameters, or if the development set used for estimating the mapping function does not match the characteristics of the test set."

        "The purpose of feature extraction is to identify, for each sentence in the parallel training data, a set of features that can be useful in estimating a weight that is correlated with quality or relevance to the MT task at hand.",
        "Starting from sentence-aligned, word-aligned parallel training data, one could extract various types of sentence-level features.",
        "For example, we could specify features that describe the two sides of the parallel data or the alignment between them, such as collection id, genre id, number of source tokens, number of target tokens, ratio of number of source and target tokens, number of word alignment links, fraction of source tokens that are unaligned, and fraction of target tokens that are unaligned.",
        "Additionally, we could include information retrieval (IR) related features that reflect the relevance of a training sentence to the domain of interest, e.g., by measuring vector space model (VSM) distance of the sentence to the current tuning set, or its log likelihhod with respect to an in-domain language model.",
        "Note that the collection and genre identifiers (ids) mentioned above are bit vectors.",
        "Each collection in the training set is mapped to a number.",
        "A collection may consist of sentences from multiple genres (e.g., newswire, web, broadcast news, broadcast conversations).",
        "Genres are also mapped to a unique number across the whole training set.",
        "Then, given a sentence in the training bitext, we can extract a binary vector that contains two nonzero bits, one indicating the collection id, and another denoting the genre id.",
        "It is worth mentioning that in the experiments reported later in this paper we made use of only the collection and genre ids as features, although the framework supports general sentence-level features.",
        "As mentioned previously, one way to map a feature vector to a weight is to use a perceptron.",
        "A multilayer neural network may also be used, but at the expense of slower training.",
        "In this work, all of the experiments carried out made use of a perceptron mapping function.",
        "However, it is also possible to cluster the training sentences into classes by training a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on their respective feature vectors.",
        "Then, given a feature vector we can compute the (posterior) probability that it was generated by one of the N Gaussians in the GMM, and use this N-dimensional vector of posteriors as input to the perceptron.",
        "This is similar to having a neural network with a static hidden layer and Gaussian activation functions.",
        "Given the many choices available in mapping features to weights, we will describe the mapping function in general terms.",
        "Let fj be the n x 1 feature vector corresponding to sentence i.",
        "Let 0(x; A) denote a function Rra â > (0,1) that is parameterized in terms of the parameter vector A and maps a feature vector x to a scalar weight in (0,1).",
        "The goal of the automatic corpus weight estimation procedure is to estimate the parameter vector A so as to optimize an objective function on a development set.",
        "Once the sentence features have been mapped to weights, the translation rule extraction and probability estimation can proceed as usual, but with weighted counts.",
        "For example, let Wi = 0(fj; A) be the weight assigned to sentence i.",
        "Let (s, t) be a source-target phrase pair that can be extracted from the corpus, and A(s) and B(t) indicating the sets of sentences that s and t occur in.",
        "Then, where Cj(-) denotes the number of occurrences of the phrase (or phrase-pair) in sentence j.",
        "Estimation of the parameters A of the mapping function <fi can be performed by directly optimizing a suitable objective function on a development set.",
        "Ideally, we would like to estimate the parameters of the mapping function so as to directly optimize an automatic MT performance evaluation metric, such as TER or BLEU on the full translation search space.",
        "However, this is extremely computationally intensive for two reasons: (a) optimizing in the full translation search space requires a new decoding pass for each iteration of optimization; and (b) a direct optimization of TER or",
        "'Note that in order to train such a GMM it may be necessary to first apply a decorrelating, dimensionality reducing, transform (e.g., principal component analysis) to the features.",
        "BLEU requires the use of a derivative free, slowly converging optimization method such as MERT (Och, 2003), because these objective functions are not differentiable.",
        "In our case, for every parameter vector update we need to essentially retrain the translation model (reestimate the phrase and lexical translation probabilities based on the updated corpus weights), so the cost of each iteration is significantly higher than in a typical MERT application.",
        "For these reasons, in this work we chose to minimize the expected TER over a translation N-best on a designated tuning set, which is a continuous and differentiable function and can be optimized with standard gradient descent methods in a small number of iterations.",
        "Note, that using expected TER is not the only option here; any criterion that can be expressed as a continuous function of the phrase or lexical translation probabilities can be used to optimize A.",
        "Given an N-best of translation hypotheses over a development set of S sentences, we can define the expected TER as follows where Ns is the number of translation hypotheses available for segment s; esj is the minimum raw edit distance between hypothesis j of segment s (or hSj, for short) and the reference translation^) corresponding to segment s; rs is the average number of reference translation tokens in segment s, and psj is the posterior probability of hypothesis hSj in the N-best.",
        "The latter is computed as follows where Lsj is the total log likelihood of hypothesis hSj, and 7 is a tunable scaling factor that can be used to change the dynamic range of the likelihood scores and hence the distribution of posteriors over the N-best.",
        "The hypothesis likelihood Lsj is typically computed as a dot product of a decoding weight vector and a vector of various \"feature\" scores, such as log phrase translation probability, log lexical translation probability, log n-gram language model probability, and number of tokens in the hypothesis.",
        "However, in order to simplify this presentation we will assume that it contains a single translation model score, the log phrase translation probability of source given target.",
        "This score is a sum of log conditional probabilities, similar to the one defined in Equation 1.",
        "Therefore, Lsj is indirectly a function of the training sentence weights.",
        "In order to minimize the expected TER T, we need to compute the derivative of T with respect to the mapping function parameters A.",
        "Using the chain rule, we get equations (4)-(8), where the summation in Equation 6 is over all source-target phrase pairs in the derivation of hypothesis hsm, Â£ is the decoding weight assigned to the log phrase translation score, and the summation in Equation 7 is over all training sentences.",
        "Thus, in order to compute the derivative of the objective function we first need to calculate 91njq^fc^fc-> for every phrase pair (sk,tk) in the translation N-best based on Equations 7 and 8, which requires time proportional to the number of occurrences of these phrases in the parallel training data.",
        "After that, we can compute for each hypothesis hsm, based on Equation 6.",
        "Finally, we calculate 9q^sj and ^ based on Equations 5 and 4, respectively.",
        "In our system, the corpus weights were trained based on N-best translation hypotheses generated by a phrase-based MT system on a designated tuning set.",
        "Each translation hypothesis in the N-best has a score that is a (linear) function of the following log translation probabilities: target phrase given source phrase, source phrase given target phrase, and lexical smoothing term.",
        "Additionally, each hypothesis specifies information about its derivation, i.e., which source-target phrase pairs it consists of.",
        "Therefore, given an N-best, we can identify the set of unique phrase pairs and use this information in order to perform a filtered accumulation of the statistics needed for calculating the derivative in Equation 8.",
        "This reduces the storage needed for the sufficient statistics significantly.",
        "Minimization of the expected TER of the N-best hypotheses was performed using the limited-memory BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).",
        "Typically, the parameter vector A required about 30 iterations of LBFGS to converge.",

        "We have described a novel approach for estimating a weight for each sentence in a parallel training corpus so as to optimize MT performance of a phrase-based statistical MT system.",
        "The sentence weights influence MT performance by being applied to the phrase and lexical counts during translation rule extraction and probability estimation.",
        "In order to ensure robust training ofthe weights, we expressed them as a function of sentence-level features.",
        "Then, we defined the process for optimizing the parameters of that function based on the expected TER of a translation hypothesis N-best on a designated tuning set.",
        "The proposed technique was evaluated in the context of Arabic-English translation, on multiple conditions.",
        "It was shown that encouraging results were obtained by just using collection and genre ids as features.",
        "Interestingly, the discriminative corpus weights were found to be generally applicable and provided gains in a state-of-the-art hierarchical string-to-dependency-tree MT system, even though they were trained using the phrase-based MT system.",
        "Next step is to include other sentence-level features, as described in Section 3.1.",
        "Finally, the technique described in this paper can be extended to address the estimation of weights at the alignment link level, based on link-level features.",
        "We believe that this will have a larger impact on the lexical and phrase translation probabilities, since there is a large number of parallel training sentences that are partially correct, i.e., they contain parts that are aligned and translated correctly, and parts that are wrong.",
        "The current procedure tries to assign a single weight to such sentences, so there is no way to distinguish between the \"good\" and \"bad\" portions of each sentence.",
        "Pushing the weight estimation at the alignment link level will alleviate this problem and will make the discriminative training more targeted."
