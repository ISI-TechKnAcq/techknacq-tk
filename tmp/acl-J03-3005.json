        "In two recent papers, Banko and Brill (2001a, 2001b) criticize the fact that current NLP algorithms are typically optimized, tested, and compared on fairly small data sets (corpora with millions of words), even though data sets several orders of magnitude larger are available, at least for some NLP tasks.",
        "Banko and Brill (2001a, 2001b) experiment with context-sensitive spelling correction, a task for which large amounts of data can be obtained straightforwardly, as no manual annotation is required.",
        "They demonstrate that the learning algorithms typically used for spelling correction benefit significantly from larger training sets, and that their performance shows no sign of reaching an asymptote as the size of the training set increases.",
        "Arguably, the largest data set that is available for NLP is the Web,1 which currently consists of at least 3,033 million pages.2 Data retrieved from the Web therefore provide enormous potential for training NLP algorithms, if Banko and Brill’s (2001a, 2001b) findings for spelling corrections generalize; potential applications include tasks that involve word n-grams and simple surface syntax.",
        "There is a small body of existing research that tries to harness the potential of the Web for NLP.",
        "Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the Web to generate corpora for languages for which electronic resources are scarce, and Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the Web in order to obtain bilingual texts.",
        "Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the Web for word sense disambiguation, Volk (2001) proposes a method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities based on Web data, Mark-ert, Nissim, and Modjeska (2003) use the Web for the resolution of nominal anaphora,",
        "and Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) use Web-based n-gram counts to improve language modeling.",
        "A particularly interesting application is proposed by Grefenstette (1998), who uses the Web for example-based machine translation.",
        "His task is to translate compounds from French into English, with corpus evidence serving as a filter for candidate translations.",
        "An example is the French compound groupe de travail.",
        "There are five translations of groupe and three translations for travail (in the dictionary that Grefenstette [1998] is using), resulting in 15 possible candidate translations.",
        "Only one of them, namely, work group, has a high corpus frequency, which makes it likely that this is the correct translation into English.",
        "Grefenstette (1998) observes that this approach suffers from an acute data sparseness problem if the counts are obtained from a conventional corpus.",
        "However, as Grefenstette (1998) demonstrates, this problem can be overcome by obtaining counts through Web searches, instead of relying on a corpus.",
        "Grefenstette (1998) therefore effectively uses the Web as a way of obtaining counts for compounds that are sparse in a given corpus.",
        "Although this is an important initial result, it raises the question of the generality of the proposed approach to overcoming data sparseness.",
        "It remains to be shown that Web counts are generally useful for approximating data that are sparse or unseen in a given corpus.",
        "It seems possible, for instance, that Grefenstette’s (1998) results are limited to his particular task (filtering potential translations) or to his particular linguistic phenomenon (noun-noun compounds).",
        "Another potential problem is the fact that Web counts are far more noisy than counts obtained from a well-edited, carefully balanced corpus.",
        "The effect of this noise on the usefulness of the Web counts is largely unexplored.",
        "Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) use Web-based n-gram counts for language modeling.",
        "They obtain a standard language model from a 103-million-word corpus and employ Web-based counts to interpolate unreliable trigram estimates.",
        "They compare their interpolated model against a baseline trigram language model (without interpolation) and show that the interpolated model yields an absolute reduction in word error rate of .93% over the baseline.",
        "Zhu and Rosenfeld’s (2001) results demonstrate that the Web can be a source of data for language modeling.",
        "It is not clear, however, whether their result carries over to tasks that employ linguistically meaningful word sequences (e.g., head-modifier pairs or predicate-argument tuples) rather than simply adjacent words.",
        "Furthermore, Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) do not undertake any studies that evaluate Web frequencies directly (i.e., without a task such as language modeling).",
        "This could be done, for instance, by comparing Web frequencies to corpus frequencies, or to frequencies recreated by smoothing techniques.",
        "The aim of the present article is to generalize Grefenstette’s (1998) and Zhu and Rosenfeld’s (2001) findings by testing the hypothesis that the Web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus.",
        "Instead of having a particular task in mind (which would introduce a sampling bias), we rely on sets of bigrams that are randomly selected from a corpus.",
        "We use a Web-based approach for bigrams that encode meaningful syntactic relations and obtain Web frequencies not only for noun-noun bigrams, but also for adjective-noun and verb-object bigrams.",
        "We thus explore whether this approach generalizes to different predicate-argument combinations.",
        "We evaluate our Web counts in four ways: (a) comparison with actual corpus frequencies from two different corpora, (b) comparison with human plausibility judgments, (c) comparison with frequencies recreated using class-based smoothing, and (d) performance in a pseudodisambiguation task on data sets from the literature."

        "The data sets used in the present experiment were obtained from the British National Corpus (BNC) (see Burnard [1995]).",
        "The BNC is a large, synchronic corpus, consisting of 90 million words of text and 10 million words of speech.",
        "The BNC is a balanced corpus (i.e., it was compiled so as to represent a wide range of present day British English).",
        "The written part includes samples from newspapers, magazines, books (both academic and fiction), letters, and school and university essays, among other kinds of text.",
        "The spoken part consists of spontaneous conversations, recorded from volunteers balanced by age, region, and social class.",
        "Other samples of spoken language are also included, ranging from business or government meetings to radio shows and phone-ins.",
        "The corpus represents many different styles and varieties and is not limited to any particular subject field, genre, or register.",
        "For the present study, the BNC was used to extract data for three types of predicate-argument relations.",
        "The first type is adjective-noun bigrams, in which we assume that the noun is the predicate that takes the adjective as its argument.",
        "The second predicate-argument type we investigated is noun-noun compounds.",
        "For these, we assume that the rightmost noun is the predicate that selects the leftmost noun as its argument (as compound nouns are generally right-headed in English).",
        "Third, we included verb-object bigrams, in which the verb is the predicate that selects the object as its argument.",
        "We considered only direct NP objects; the bigram consists of the verb and the head noun of the object.",
        "For each of the three predicate-argument relations, we gathered two data sets, one containing seen bigrams (i.e., bigrams that occur in the BNC) and one with unseen bigrams (i.e., bigrams that do not occur in the BNC).",
        "For the seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows.",
        "First, 30 adjectives were randomly chosen from a part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized version of the BNC so that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al.",
        "1990) and was unambiguously tagged as “adjective” 98.6% of the time.",
        "Lapata, McDonald, and Keller used the part-of-speech-tagged version that is made available with the BNC and was tagged using CLAWS4 (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), a probabilistic part-of-speech tagger, with error rate ranging from 3% to 4%.",
        "The lemmatized version of the corpus was obtained using Karp et al.’s (1992) morphological analyzer.",
        "The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million words; that is, they covered the whole range from fairly infrequent to highly frequent items.",
        "Gsearch (Corley et al.",
        "2001), a chart parser that detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query, was used to extract all nouns occurring in a head-modifier relationship with one of the 30 adjectives.",
        "Examples of the syntactic patterns the parser identified are given in Table 1.",
        "In the case of adjectives modifying compound nouns, only sequences of two nouns were included, and the rightmost-occurring noun was considered the head.",
        "Bigrams involving proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less than 10 per million words) were discarded.",
        "This was necessary because the bigrams were used in experiments involving native speakers (see Section 3.2), and we wanted to reduce the risk of including words unfamiliar to the experimental subjects.",
        "For each adjective, the set of bigrams was divided into three frequency bands based on an equal division of the",
        "range of log-transformed co-occurrence frequencies.",
        "Then one bigram was chosen at random from each band.",
        "This procedure ensures that the whole range of frequencies is represented in our sample.",
        "Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) compiled a set of 90 unseen adjective-noun bigrams using the same 30 adjectives.",
        "For each adjective, Gsearch was used to compile a list of all nouns that did not co-occur in a head-modifier relationship with the adjective.",
        "Again, proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were discarded from this list.",

        "More specifically, 30 nouns and 30 verbs were chosen according to the same criteria proposed for the adjective study (i.e., minimal sense ambiguity and unambiguous part of speech).",

        "Verb-object bigrams for the 30 preselected verbs were obtained from the BNC using Cass (Abney 1996), a robust chunk parser designed for the shallow analysis of noisy text.",
        "The parser recognizes chunks and simplex clauses (i.e., sequences of nonrecursive clauses) using a regular expression grammar and a part-of-speech-tagged corpus, without attempting to resolve attachment ambiguities.",
        "It comes with a large-scale grammar for English and a built-in tool that extracts predicate-argument tuples out of the parse trees that Cass produces.",
        "The parser’s output was postprocessed to remove bracketing errors and errors in identifying chunk categories that could potentially result in bigrams whose members do not stand in a verb-argument relationship.",
        "Tuples containing verbs or nouns attested in a verb-argument relationship only once were eliminated.",
        "Particle verbs were retained only if the particle was adjacent to the verb (e.g., come off heroin).",
        "Verbs followed by the preposition by and a head noun were considered instances of verb-subject relations.",
        "It was assumed that PPs adjacent to the verb headed by any of the prepositions in, to, for, with, on, at, from, of, into, through, and upon were prepositional objects (see Lapata [2001] for details on the filtering process).",
        "Only nominal heads were retained from the objects returned by the parser.",
        "As in the adjective study, noun-noun bigrams and verb-object bigrams with proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less than 10 per million words) were discarded.",
        "The sets of noun-noun and verb-object bigrams were divided into three frequency bands, and one bigram was chosen at random from each band.",
        "The procedure described by Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) was followed for creating sets of unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams: for each noun or verb, we compiled a list of all nouns with which it did not co-occur within a noun-noun or verb-object bigram in the BNC.",
        "Again, Lauer’s (1995) heuristic and Abney’s (1996) partial parser were used to identify bigrams, and proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were excluded.",
        "For each noun and verb, three bigrams were formed by pairing it with a noun randomly selected from the set of the non-co-occurring nouns for that noun or verb.",
        "Table 2 lists examples for the seen and unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams generated by this procedure.",
        "The extracted bigrams are in several respects an imperfect source of information about adjective-noun or noun-noun modification and verb-object relations.",
        "First notice that both Gsearch and Cass detect syntactic patterns on part-of-speech-tagged corpora.",
        "This means that parsing errors are likely to result because of tagging mistakes.",
        "Second, even if one assumes perfect tagging, the heuristic nature of our extraction procedures may introduce additional noise or miss bigrams for which detailed structural information would be needed.",
        "For instance, our method for extracting adjective-noun pairs ignores cases in which the adjective modifies noun sequences of length greater than two.",
        "The heuristic in (1) considers only two-word noun sequences.",
        "Abney’s (1996) chunker recognizes basic syntactic units without resolving attachment ambiguities or recovering missing information (such as traces resulting from the movement of constituents).",
        "Although parsing is robust and fast (since unlike in traditional parsers, no global optimization takes",
        " place), the identified verb-argument relations are undoubtedly somewhat noisy, given the errors inherent in the part-of-speech tagging and chunk recognition procedure.",
        "When evaluated against manually annotated data, Abney’s (1996) parser identified chunks with 87.9% precision and 87.1% recall.",
        "The parser further achieved a per-word accuracy of 92.1% (where per-word accuracy includes the chunk category and chunk length identified correctly).",
        "Despite their imperfect output, heuristic methods for the extraction of syntactic relations are relatively common in statistical NLP.",
        "Several statistical models employ frequencies obtained from the output of partial parsers and other heuristic methods; these include models for disambiguating the attachment site of prepositional phrases (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi 1998), models for interpreting compound nouns (Lauer 1995; Lapata 2002) and polysemous adjectives (Lapata 2001), models for the induction of selectional preferences (Abney and Light 1999), methods for automatically clustering words according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993), automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette 1994; Curran 2002), and similarity-based models of word co-occurrence probabilities (Lee 1999; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999).",
        "In this article we investigate alternative ways for obtaining bigram frequencies that are potentially useful for such models despite the fact that some of these bigrams are identified in a heuristic manner and may be noisy."

        "We also obtained corpus counts from a second corpus, the North American News Text Corpus (NANTC).",
        "This corpus differs in several important respects from the BNC.",
        "It is substantially larger, as it contains 350 million words of text.",
        "Also, it is not a balanced corpus, as it contains material from only one genre, namely, news text.",
        "However, the text originates from a variety of sources (Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times News Syndicate, Reuters News Service, and Wall Street Journal).",
        "Whereas the BNC covers British English, the NANTC covers American English.",
        "All these differences mean that the NANTC provides a second, independent standard against which to compare Web counts.",
        "At the same time the correlation found between the counts obtained from the two corpora can serve as an upper limit for the correlation that we can expect between corpus counts and Web counts.",
        "The NANTC corpus was parsed using MINIPAR (Lin 1994, 2001), a broad-coverage parser for English.",
        "MINIPAR employs a manually constructed grammar and a lexicon derived from WordNet with the addition of proper names (130,000 entries in total).",

        "In contrast to Gsearch and Cass, MINIPAR produces all possible parses for a given sentence.",

        "We searched the whole Web (as indexed by AltaVista and Google); that is, the queries were not restricted to pages in English.",

        "Recall that the NANTC is 3.5 times larger than the BNC, which does not seem to be enough to substantially mitigate data sparseness.",

        "From these data, we computed the average factor by which the Web counts are larger than the BNC counts.",
        "The results are given in Table 7 and indicate that the AltaVista counts are between 550 and 691 times larger than the BNC counts, and that the Google counts are between 1,064 and 1,306 times larger than the BNC counts.",

        "The method we used to retrieve Web counts is based on very simple heuristics; it is thus inevitable that the counts generated will contain a certain amount of noise.",
        "In this section we discuss a number of potential sources of such noise.",
        "An obvious limitation of our method is that it relies on the page counts returned by the search engines; we do not download the pages themselves for further processing.",
        "Note that many of the bigrams in our sample are very frequent (up to 106 matches; see the “Max” columns in Table 6), hence the effort involved in downloading all pages would be immense (though methods for downloading a representative sample could probably be devised).",
        "Our approach estimates Web frequencies based not on bigram counts directly, but on page counts.",
        "In other words, it ignores the fact that a bigram can occur more than once on a given Web page.",
        "This approximation is justified, as Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) demonstrated for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams: Page counts and n-gram counts are highly correlated on a log-log scale.",
        "This result is based on Zhu and Rosenfeld’s queries to AltaVista, a search engine that at the time of their research returned both the number of pages and the overall number of matches for a given query.4 Another important limitation of our approach arises from the fact that both Google and AltaVista disregard punctuation and capitalization, even if the search term is placed within quotation marks.",
        "This can lead to false positives, for instance, if the match crosses a phrase boundary, such as in (5), which matches hungry prey.",
        "Other false positives can be generated by page titles and links, such as the examples (6) and (7) which match edition broadcast.5",
        "(5) The lion will kill only when it’s hungry.",
        "Prey can usually sense when lions are hunting.",
        "(6) 10th Edition Broadcast Products Catalog (as a page title) (7) Issue/Edition/Broadcast (as a link)",
        "The fact that our method does not download Web pages means that no tagging, chunking, or parsing can be carried out to ensure that the matches are correct.",
        "Instead we rely on the simple adjacency of the search terms, which is enforced by using queries enclosed within quotation marks (see Section 2.3 for details).",
        "This means that we miss any nonadjacent matches, even though a chunker or parser (such as the one used for extracting BNC or NANTC bigrams) would find them.",
        "An example is an adjective-noun bigram in which an adverbial intervenes between the adjective and the noun (see Table 1).",
        "Furthermore, the absence of tagging, chunking, and parsing can also generate false positives, in particular for queries containing words with part-of-speech ambiguity.",
        "(Recall that our bigram selection procedure ensures that the predicate word, but not the argument word, is unambiguous in terms of its POS tagging in the BNC.)",
        "As an example, consider process directory, which in our data set is a noun-noun bigram (see Table 2).",
        "One of the matches returned by Google is (8), in which process is a verb.",
        "Another example is fund membrane, which is a noun-noun bigram in our data set but matches (9) in Google.",
        "Keller and Lapata Web Frequencies for Unseen Bigrams",
        "(8) The global catalog server’s function is to process directory searches for the entire forest.",
        "(9) Green grants fund membrane technology.",
        "Another source of noise is the fact that Google (but not AltaVista) will sometimes return pages that do not include the search term at all.",
        "This can happen if the search term is contained in a link to the page (but not on the page itself).",
        "As we did not limit our Web searches to English (even though many search engines now allow the target language for a search to be set), there is also a risk that false positives are generated by cross-linguistic homonyms, that is, by words of other languages that are spelled in the same way as the English words in our data sets.",
        "However, this problem is mitigated by the fact that English is by far the most common language on the Web, as shown by Grefenstette and Nioche (2000).",
        "Also, the chance of two such homonyms forming a valid bigram in another language is probably fairly small.",
        "To summarize, Web counts are certainly less sparse than the counts in a corpus of a fixed size (see Section 2.3).",
        "However, Web counts are also likely to be significantly more noisy than counts obtained from a carefully tagged and chunked or parsed corpus, as the examples in this section show.",

        "Other smoothing approaches such as discounting (Katz 1987) and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling 1994; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) recreate counts of unseen word combinations by exploiting only corpus-internal evidence, without relying on taxonomic information.",

        "First of all, the two smoothing methods (i.e., EM-based clustering and class-based probability estimation using WordNet) were not evaluated on the same data set, and therefore the two results are not directly comparable.",
        "For instance, Clark and Weir’s (2002) data set is substantially less noisy than Rooth et al.’s (1999) and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth’s (2000), as it contains only words and nouns that occur in WordNet.",
        "Furthermore, Stephen Clark (personal communication, 2003) points out that WordNet-based approaches are at a disadvantage when it comes to pseudodisambiguation.",
        "Pseudodisambiguation assumes that the correct pair is unseen in the training data; this makes the task deliberately hard, because some of the pairs might be frequent enough that reliable corpus counts can be obtained without having to use WordNet (using WordNet is likely to be more noisy than using the actual counts).",
        "Another problem with WordNet-based approaches is that they offer no systematic treatment of word sense ambiguity, which puts them at a disadvantage with respect to approaches that do not rely on a predefined inventory of word senses.",
        "Finally, recall that the results for the EM-based approaches in Tables 13 and 14 were obtained on the development set (as pseudodisambiguation was used as a means of parameter tuning by Rooth et al.",
        "[1999] and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth [2000]).",
        "It is possible that this fact inflates the performance values for the EM-based approaches (but see note 8)."

        "This article explored a novel approach to overcoming data sparseness.",
        "If a bigram is unseen in a given corpus, conventional approaches recreate its frequency using techniques such as back-off, linear interpolation, class-based smoothing or distance-weighted averaging (see Dagan, Lee, and Pereira [1999] and Lee [1999] for overviews).",
        "The approach proposed here does not recreate the missing counts but instead retrieves them from a corpus that is much larger (but also much more noisy) than any existing corpus: it launches queries to a search engine in order to determine how often the bigram occurs on the Web.",
        "We systematically investigated the validity of this approach by using it to obtain frequencies for predicate-argument bigrams (adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams).",
        "We first applied the approach to seen bigrams randomly sampled from the BNC.",
        "We found that the counts obtained from the Web are highly correlated with the counts obtained from the BNC.",
        "We then obtained bigram counts from NANTC, a corpus that is substantially larger than the BNC.",
        "Again, we found that Web counts are highly correlated with corpus counts.",
        "This indicates that Web queries can generate frequencies that are comparable to the ones obtained from a balanced, carefully edited corpus such as the BNC, but also from a large news text corpus such as NANTC.",
        "Secondly, we performed an evaluation that used the Web frequencies to predict human plausibility judgments for predicate-argument bigrams.",
        "The results show that Web counts correlate reliably with judgments, for all three types of predicate-argument bigrams tested, both seen and unseen.",
        "For the seen bigrams, we showed that the Web frequencies correlate better with judged plausibility than corpus frequencies.",
        "To substantiate the claim that the Web counts can be used to overcome data sparseness, we compared bigram counts obtained from the Web with bigram counts recreated using a class-based smoothing technique (a variant of the one proposed by Resnik [1993]).",
        "We found that Web frequencies and recreated frequencies are reliably correlated, and that Web frequencies are better at predicting plausibility judgments than smoothed frequencies.",
        "This holds both for unseen bigrams and for seen bigrams that are treated as unseen by omitting them from the training corpus.",
        "Finally, we tested the performance of our frequencies in a standard pseudodisambiguation task.",
        "We applied our method to three data sets from the literature.",
        "The results show that Web counts outperform counts recreated using a number of class-based smoothing techniques.",
        "However, counts recreated using an EM-based smoothing approach yielded better pseudodisambiguation performance than Web counts.",
        "To summarize, we have proposed a simple heuristic method for obtaining bigram counts from the Web.",
        "Using four different types of evaluation, we demonstrated that this simple heuristic method is sufficient to obtain valid frequency estimates.",
        "It seems that the large amount of data available outweighs the problems associated with using the Web as a corpus (such as the fact that it is noisy and unbalanced).",
        "A number of questions arise for future research: (1) Are Web frequencies suitable for probabilistic modeling, in particular since Web counts are not perfectly normalized, as Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) have shown?",
        "(2) How can existing smoothing methods benefit from Web counts?",
        "(3) How do the results reported in this article carry over to languages other than English (for which a much smaller amount of Web data are available)?",
        "(4) What is the effect of the noise introduced by our heuristic approach?",
        "The last question could be assessed by reproducing our results using a snapshot of the Web, from which argument relations can be extracted more accurately using POS tagging and chunking techniques.",
        "Finally, it will be crucial to test the usefulness of Web-based frequencies for realistic NLP tasks.",
        "Preliminary results are reported by Lapata and Keller (2003), who use Web counts successfully for a range of NLP tasks, including candidate selection for machine translation, context-sensitive spelling correction, bracketing and interpretation of compounds, adjective ordering, and PP attachment."
