        "Since Kay's seminal work (Kay 1979), the utility of unification as a general tool in computational linguistics has gained widespread recognition.",
        "One major point on which the methodology of unification grammars differs radically from that assumed by linguistic theories lies in the way they deal with generalizations that hold over the domain of description.",
        "In unification-based theories, such generalizations are typically implicit, or extremely limited in their import.",
        "The reasons for this are easy to pinpoint.",
        "First, in such theories one has to be explicit about the feature structures that the grammar manipulates, and these structures have to be described more or less directly.",
        "In PATR-II for example (Shieber et al. 1983) the only means of expressing a generalization is via the notion of template, a structure which merely represents recurring information â€“ i.e.",
        "information that 'The work reported here was carried out as part of ESPRIT project P393 ACORD.",
        "A longer version of this paper can be found in Calder et al. (1988a).",
        "recurs in different lexical items, combination rules, lexical rules or other templates.",
        "A second reason why unification-based theories do not lend themselves easily to the expression of general statements is that there is no explicit quantification in unification formalisms.",
        "In fact, every statement in these formalisms represents a simple existential constraint, never a universal generalization.",
        "The work reported here is an attempt to introduce higher levels of organization into unification grammars.",
        "The notions we employ to do this come from sorted logics and from strong data typing in programming language theory.",
        "We will show that the typing of grammatical objects offers a way of stating structural constraints on, or equivalently universal properties of, the objects that constitute the grammar.",
        "The grammatical framework in which these ideas have been implemented is Unification Cat-egorial Grammar (UCG) and its semantic representation language InL, both developed as part of the ESPRIT-funded project ACORD.",
        "Introductions to UCG and InL can be found in Calder et al. (1988b) and Zeevat (1988).",
        "For present purposes it is sufficient to note that UCG uses a sorted logic which requires being able to express complex constraints over clusters of features.",
        "While there is no real distinction between this technique and that of data typing mentioned above, we will nevertheless continue to use the term typing only to refer to constraints on the global structure of an object and reserve the term sort to refer to constraints that hold of a variable in InL.",
        "In the following sections, we will first discuss our strategy of using global declarations to limit possible linguistic structures.",
        "We will briefly describe some of the type declarations currently implemented in UCG and discuss the unusual aspects of our type-checking algorithm.",
        "We will also infor-- 174 - mally describe the InL sort system and will show how the ability to express global constraints on the sort lattice is both perspicuous and expressively powerful.",
        "Detailed discussion of the underlying formal theory and the implementation can be found in Calder et al. (1988a) and will not be attempted here.",
        "Next, we will demonstrate the usefulness of the sort system by describing UCG's adjunct resolution system, the declarative semantics of which depends crucially on our use of a logic of sorts.",
        "This treatment allows the grammar writer to write and add adjunct resolution conditions using the same notation as that used to express sort descriptions in the grammar and without having to modify any implementation code."

        "Importing the notion of data typing into unification-based grammars has several advantages (cf. also Calder et al. 1986, Calder 1987).",
        "To begin with, the use of data typing allows one to show whether a grammar is consistent with a set of statements about the possible structures allowed within the grammar.",
        "This compile-time type-checking of the structures designed by the grammar writer allows more useful error information to be presented to the grammar writer.",
        "We have found such information essential in writing large grammars for the ACORD project.",
        "Second, data typing forces the grammar writer to make the structure of linguistic objects explicit.",
        "This higher level of organization makes it easier to pinpoint aspects of the grammar which are inelegant or inefficient.",
        "Finally, the notion of typing represents a further step towards the goal of making local structures reflect global restrictions.",
        "This move is an essential part of the programme of characterizing, within a formal computational theory, linguistic devices such as GPSG's feature co-occurrence restrictions.",
        "A standard way of defining categorial grammars is to provide a set of basic categories and one or more recursive rules for defining complex categories.",
        "A very similar definition holds in UCG.",
        "Following Pollard & Sag (1987), we treat every UCG object, apart from the rules, as a sign.",
        "That is, it represents a complex conjunction of phonological, syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We can further specify a sign by adding constraints on legal instantiations of each of the sign's attributes: for example, semantics in UCG has a tripartite structure, consisting of an index, a predicate and an argument list.",
        "It is obvious that the abstract structure of each of these categories must be known in advance to the interpreter.",
        "The formalism we will use here for declaring types is borrowed from Smolka (1988), and the following illustrates his matrix notation for record structures, where type symbols are written in bold face, and feature symbols are written in italics':",
        "The structure as a whole is declared to be of type sign, and it is defined for exactly three features, namely phonology, category, and semantics.",
        "We also show, for each feature, the types of the values that it takes; as it happens, these are all disjunctive.",
        "So, for example, the feature semantics has a value either of type variable or of type formula.",
        "Obviously, further information has to be given about what constitute legal structures of type formula.",
        "As was mentioned above, semantic formulae in InL are typically tripartite: [formula index : variable predicate : basic U list arglist: basic U sem_args For present purposes, it suffices to know that the first element is the index, a privileged variable representing the ontological type and the identity of the semantic structure.",
        "Next, there is the predicate.",
        "This may be basic or a list of atoms.",
        "The type basic is the only type provided as a primitive in the system, and indicates that only instantiations to an atomic value (in the PROLOG sense of atomic) are legal.",
        "In the case where the predicate is a list, it represents a disjunction over adjunct functions, as will be discussed below.",
        "Further discussion of (1) and (2) is not possible within the limited space here.",
        "The examples are only intended to illustrate how at each level in a UCG sign, type specifications can be given that indicate restrictions on the value any given feature may take on.",
        "However, one point deserves further",
        "comment.",
        "It will be recalled that earlier we said the structure (1) was \"defined for exactly three features\".",
        "It follows from this that, for example, (1i) would not be a legal instantiation of this type:",
        "Thus, types in UCG are closed: all features which are not explicitly stated as defined in a particular type declaration are held to be undefined for that type (i.e. they can only be specified as 1).",
        "Consequently, closed types offer a form of universal quantification over features.",
        "This device offers a way of characterizing the well-formedness of different dimensions of a sign that is stronger than systems based on open types, such as HPSG.2 The UCG compiler uses declarations like those in (1) and (2) to check variables for consistent typing.",
        "This involves keeping track of all variables introduced by a particular UCG expression as well as of the possible types that a variable may be assigned.",
        "The compiler proves that, for multiple occurrences of the same variable, the intersection of the sets of possible types induced for each occurrence of the variable is non-empty.",
        "If the set is empty, the compilation process fails and an error is reported.",
        "This technique has the advantage that one may partition the set of variables employed by the system.",
        "Thus in UCG, the set of PROLOG variables that is used to represent variables in an InL formula is disjoint from the set used to represent the predicate introduced by a sign: the type of variables of the first set is stated to be variable, while the type of those of the second set is predicate.",
        "This property is crucial if we wish to check for correctness of highly underspecified structures."

        "The standard consequence relation over these partial descriptions (i.e. the formulae of L,t) induces a lattice (cf. Mellish 1988).",
        "Moreover, the sets of models associated with these partial descriptions (i.e. the truth assignments to the formulae) also form a lattice, ordered by the set inclusion relation.",
        "This lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of descriptions.",
        "The model sets can be encoded as binary bit strings where a zero bit indicates that the corresponding model is not a member of the model set and a one bit indicates the opposite.",
        "Model set intersection is equivalent to bitwise conjunction and model set union to bitwise disjunction.",
        "Testing for the satisfiability of the conjunction of two descriptions can consequently be performed in two machine instructions, viz. taking the bitwise conjunction of two model' set encodings and testing for zero (cf. Proudian & Pollard 1985).",
        "Such a model set encoding is obviously linear in the number of models it generates; in the worst case, the number of models is exponential in the number of propositional constants mentioned in Tort, but typically it is much less.",
        "This means that the exponential complexity involved in testing for satisfiability can be compiled away offline; the resulting model set encoding can be used with equal computational efficiency.",
        "As illustrated above, the statements that define the lattice of sorts can be arbitrary statements in classical propositional logic.",
        "This is in distinction to systems discussed by Mellish (1988) and Alshawi et al. (1988), in which the set of logical connectives is restricted to those for which an encoding exists using PROLOG terms without repeated variables and for which PROLOG unification provides an immediate test of the compatibility of two descriptions.",
        "The resulting sort definition language is therefore more expressive.",
        "The major drawback of such an approach is that the encoding",
        "in terms of sets of satisfying models prevents the statement of reentrant dependencies between features in the sort system and features in the rest of the grammar.",
        "A more general, but computationally less efficient approach would use general disjunction and negation over feature structures, as discussed by Smolka (1988), and so give a uniform encoding of sortal and general grammatical information.",
        "The fact that the lattice soon becomes rather complicated isn't particularly worrisome: the grammar writer need only write simple background axioms in 7.0,1, like the ones in (5) to (9), to extend or otherwise change the sort lattice.",

        "Ambiguity in the attachment of prepositional phrases is a longstanding problem in the area of natural language processing.",
        "We suggest that this ambiguity has two basic causes.",
        "First, there is structural ambiguity in that prepositional phrases may modify at least nouns and verb phrases.",
        "This structural ambiguity is a cause of inefficiency in processing.",
        "Second, prepositions may have several distinct, if related, meanings.",
        "(This problem becomes even more acute in a multilingual setting with a common semantic representation language).",
        "Such ambiguity then represents an indeterminacy for theorem provers and knowledge bases that deal with the output of a natural language component.",
        "The mechanisms we have introduced above allow us to address both these problems simultaneously.",
        "We use the term adjunct resolution to describe the situation in which the possible meanings of a preposition, perhaps drawn from a universal set of possible prepositional meanings, and the possible attachments of a prepositional phrase are mutually constraining.",
        "To consider the problem from the multilingual point of view, the way in which a particular language uses its prepositions to decompose the set of spatial and temporal relations that obtain between objects and events may well be inconsistent with the decomposition shown in other languages.",
        "For example, the French preposition dans can express spatial location (il est dans la chambre - he is in the room), spatial inclusion (dans un rayon de 15 kilometres - within a radius of 10 miles), spatial path (il passerait dans le feu pour elle - he'd go through fire for her sake), spatial source (copier quelque chose dans un livre - copy something from a book), and several other relations.",
        "In the semantic representation language InL, the meaning of a preposition is a relation between two InL indices.",

        "(14) John walked to the store would be (15) Iellwalk(e,john) & store(x) direction(e,x)J",
        "where \"direction(e,x)\" represents a relation between the going event and the store.",
        "However, as noted above, a preposition will typically introduce a disjunction over relations.",

        "Let us look at an English example in some more detail.",
        "An adjunct phrase introduced by with can express (without aiming to be exhaustive) an accompaniment relation (as in 18a), the manner in which an act was carried out (18b), the instrument with which it was carried out (illustrated in 18c), or something which is part of something or owned by someone (as in 18d).",

        "In some cases, the sortal restrictions may actually remove prepositional attachment ambiguities altogether.",

        "The preposition in introduces a disjunction between (amongst other things) spatial location and duration.",
        "The former can relate an object with any other object or event.",
        "The latter relation can only hold of expressions involving some temporality; as was illustrated above, tomato has no temporal extent, therefore does not allow this kind of temporal timespan to be predicated of it.",
        "As a result, the prepositional phrase in (24a) can only get high attachment.",
        "Although the discussion has been limited to the use of sortal information in adjunct resolution and the treatment of certain agreement phenomena, it should be clear that exactly the same mechanism may be used to indicate sortal restrictions associated with any other predicates of the system.",
        "Thus we have one way of expressing the linguistic concept of selectional restrictions.",
        "We realize that care has to be taken here, since there is no well-defined point at which statements about sortal correctness become clearly inappropriate.",
        "For instance, we might be tempted to treat the ambiguity associated with the verb bank as in Ronnie banked the cheque and Maggie banked the MIG by invoking a feature monetary for the first example and a feature manoeuvrable for the second.",
        "If we had a clear picture of precisely those properties that might be invoked for lexical disambiguation, this approach might be tenable.",
        "It seems more likely to be the case that the features and axioms about those features used in a particular case are ad hoc and domain-specific, as their creation and definition would be governed by just those lexical items one wanted to distinguish.",
        "Also they are language-specific, as patterns of homography presumably do not hold cross-linguistically.",
        "It is, nevertheless, plausible (following Kaplan 1987) to assume that the techniques we have introduced could be employed in the automatic projection of non-lexical knowledge into the lexicon.",
        "The notation we have presented above for the definition of sorts and the relations between sorts that prepositions represent may appear somewhat removed from the notation introduced in section 2 in our discussion of typed grammatical objects.",
        "It is however worth noting that the use of \"ordersorted algebras\" (Meseguer et al. 1987) as the mathematical basis of feature structures allows not only the statement of such restrictions on the structure of grammatical and semantic objects, but also the definition of relations, like our prepositional relations above, whose interpretation is dependent on the interpretation of the structures they relate.",
        "Such formalisms may well provide a useful foundation for a more general theory of prepositional meaning and its relation to syntactic structure."
