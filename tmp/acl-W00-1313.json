        "This paper proposed a new query translation method based on the mutual information matrices of terms in the Chinese and English corpora.",
        "Instead of looking up a bilingual phrase dictionary, the compositional phrase (the translation of phrase can be derived from the translation of its components) in the query can be indirectly translated via a general-purpose Chinese-English dictionary lookup procedure.",
        "A novel selection method for translations of query terms is also presented in detail.",
        "Our query translation method ultimately constructs an English query in which each query term has a weight.",
        "The evaluation results show that the retrieval performance achieved by our query translation method is about 73% of monolingual information retrieval and is about 28% higher than that of simple word-by-word translation way.",
        "Introduction With the rapid growth of electronic documents and the great development of network in China, there are more and more people touching the Internet, on which, however, English is the most popular language being used.",
        "It is difficult for most people in China to use English fluently, so they would like to use Chinese to express their queries to retrieval the relevant English documents.",
        "This situation motivates research in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).",
        "There are two approaches to CUR, one is query translation; the other is translating original language documents to destination This research was supported by the National Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholars under contact 69983009. language equivalents.",
        "Obviously, the latter is a very expensive task since there are so many documents in a collection and there is not yet a reliable machine translation system that can be used to process automatically.",
        "Most researchers are inclined to choose the query translation approach [Oard.",
        "(1996)].",
        "Methods for query translation have focused on three areas: the employment of machine translation techniques, dictionary based translation [Hull & Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft (1996)], parallel or comparable corpora for generating a translation model [Davis & Dunning (1995); Sheridan & Ballerini (1996); Nie, Jian-Yun et al.(1999)].",
        "Machine translation (MT) method has many obstacles to prevent its employment into CLIR such as deep syntactic and semantic analysis, user queries consisting of only one or two words, and an arduous task to build a MT system.",
        "Dictionary based query translation is the most popular method because of its easiness to perform.",
        "The main reasons leading to the great drops in CUR effectiveness by this method are ambiguities caused by more than one translation of a query term and failures to translate phrases during query translation.",
        "Previous studies [Hull & Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft (1996)] have shown that automatic word-byword (WBW) query translation via machine readable dictionary (MRD) results in a 40-60% loss in effectiveness below that of monolingual retrieval.",
        "With regard to the use of parallel corpora translation method, the critiques one often raises concern the availability of reliable parallel text corpora.",
        "An alternative way is that making use of the comparable corpora because they are easier to be obtained and there are more and more bilingual even multilingual documents on the Internet.",
        "From analyzing a document collection, an associated word list can be yielded and it is often used to expansion the query in monolingual information retrieval [Qiu",
        "In this paper, a new query translation is presented by combination dictionary based method with the comparable corpora analyzing.",

        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 1 gives a method to calculate the mutual information matrices of Chinese-English comparable corpora.",
        "Section 2 develops a scheme to select the translations of the Chinese query terms and introduces how the compositional phrase can be kept in our method.",
        "Section 3 presents a set of preliminary experiment on comparable corpora to evaluate",
        "We hypothesize that the words in a sentence after being removed the stop words be associated with each other and work together to express a query requirement.",
        "The association relationship between two words can be indicated by their mutual information, which can be further used to discover phrases [Church & Hanks (1990)].",
        "If two words are independent with each other, their mutual information would be close to zero.",
        "On the other hand, if they are strongly related, the mutual information would be much greater than zero and they would be much like to be a phrase; if they occur complementarily, the mutual information would be negative.",
        "In conclusion; the bigger the mutual information of word pair, the more probable the word phrase would be a phrase.",
        "According to [Fano (1961)], we can define the mutual information MI (t1 , t 2) of term t1 and",
        "t, and t2 in a Chinese sentence.",
        "The reason we select a Chinese sentence to be a window other than a fixed length window is that a full Chinese sentence can keep more linguistic information and consequently, it is more reasonable that we can regard t1 and t2 to be a phrase when they co-occur in a sentence.",
        "P(t1) and P(t 2) are the occurrence probabilities of term t1 and t2 in a sentence.",
        "These probabilities can be calculated by the occurrence of term ti and t2 in the collection as equation (2), (3) and (4).",
        "nr is the individual term frequency of , term t1 and t2 respectively if either of them occur in a sentence of the collection.",
        "is the co-occurrence frequency of term t, and t2 if they are all in a sentence of the collection.",
        "N is the number of sentences of the collection.",
        "Replacing (1) with equation (2), (3) and (4), the mutual information of term t and t2 can be",
        "expressed by following formula.",
        "MI(tt2)=log2 N =(5) Table 2 and table 3 show the occurrence frequency values and mutual information values calculated by formula (5) for three Chinese compositional phrases and their corresponding English phrases respectively found in our comparable corpora.",
        "phrases ( N =184,000) Analyzing the Chinese-English comparable corpora in this way, we can get two mutual information value matrices to indicate which two terms (as to the Chinese collection, they are",
        "almost Chinese words after segmentation) would be most possible to be a phrase.",
        "A word list associated to each Chinese query term can be obtained by looking up the mutual information value matrix of the Chinese corpus with a cutoff of M/ = 1.50 .",
        "As discussed above, the bigger the mutual information value between two terms, the more possible the two words would be a phrase.",
        "We can infer that the associated word list of the query term contains the terms that are the most possible components of a compositional phrase.",
        "In other words, the phrase information can be kept by this way.",
        "The Chinese query is translated into English via looking up the English senses of Chinese query term and words in its associated word list in a Chinese-English dictionary.",
        "The procedures how to select appropriate tranlations and to construct the English query are discussed in section 2.",
        "2Translations selection and phrase keeping It is a naive method to translate a Chinese query only by looking up each Chinese term to get its English senses in a Chinese-English dictionary.",
        "This method, however, results in too many ambiguities during the query translation and offers no path to select appropriate ones among the translations.",
        "In addition, phrases in the query can not be translated effectively.",
        "Previous study has showed that failure to translate phrases greatly reduces the performance by up to 25% over automatic word-by-word (WBW) query translation [Ballesteros & Croft (1996)].",
        "In our method, those English translations most likely co-occur with each other can be obtained via looking up the mutual information value matrix of the English corpus with a cutoff M/ = 1.50 .",
        "In this way, the English senses of terms in the associated word list can provide a good context for the translation of the Chinese query term and give a significant clue for its translations selection.",
        "In addition, the information of two terms (either Chinese or English) to be a phrase can also be stored in the associated word list.",
        "In the following, we firstly describe our method to select translations in detail, and then we give an example to demonstrate how to keep the phrase information in our method.",

        "If there is no weight of any translation of the Chinese query term greater than 1.00, the sense with biggest one is selected to construct the English query.",

        "In the manual translation method, the Chinese queries are translated into English by a Ph.D. student.",
        "The segmentation we used is based on a small general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual dictionary that only contains 46,570 pairs in which each Chinese word has several English translations.",
        "The forward and backward maximum matching algorithm is used to segment the texts and find the combinatorial ambiguities.",
        "Of all the combinatorial ambiguities, 91.2% are removed with the word uni-gram prior probabilities.",

        "on the basis of the formula (9).",
        "The document collection used in our experiments consists of several Chinese and corresponding English computer manuals, which include Linux-HOWTO, PostgreSQL handbook, Mysql handbook, Linux kernel* and Linux Gazette 17 volumes (from July, 1998 to Dec., 1999)\".",
        "In order get a large number document Chinese and English collections, we decomposed these manuals and let every document no more than 15 sentences.",
        "As a",
        "result, Chinese-English bilingual comparable corpora are obtained in which contain about 8,200 Chinese documents and 12,500 English documents.",
        "We design 13 Chinese queries, the average length is about 7 single Chinese character (about three Chinese words).",

        "The third column contains precision values achieved by our translation method (QT).",
        "The results in table 4 suggest that in this case, the WBW query translation leads to a great drop in effectiveness of 42.90% below that for monolingual retrieval (manual translation method).",
        "The result of our query translation method greatly improves effectiveness by 28.22% over the WBW method, and its effectiveness is about 73.21% of that for monolingual retrieval.",

        "Conclusion Automatic word-by-word query translation is an attractive method because it is easy to perform, resources are readily available, and performance is similar to that of other CLIR methods.",
        "However, there are a lot of ambiguities in translation of the query terms and failures to translate phrases correctly, which are mainly responsible for the large drops in effectiveness below monolingual retrieval performance.",
        "Aiming to tackle with these problems, we develop a new scheme for how to select translations in this paper.",

        "In this study, our method leads to improve the effectiveness by 28.22% over the word by word query translation method, but is still about 27% below the monolingual retrieval performance.",
        "If query expansion is employed in our method, we expect the performance should be further improved.",
        "A shortcoming of our method is that the cost of calculation of the mutual information matrices is very large.",
