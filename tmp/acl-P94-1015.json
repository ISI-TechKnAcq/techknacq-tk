        "A channel is a communication medium associated with a particular encoding method.",
        "Examples are the auditory channel (carrying speech) and the visual channel (carrying facial expressions).",
        "A modality is the sense used to perceive signals from the outside world.",
        "Many researchers have been developing mul-timodal dialogue systems.",
        "In some cases, researchers have shown that information in one channel complements or modifies information in another.",
        "As a simple example, the phrase \"delete it\" involves the coordination of voice with gesture.",
        "Neither makes sense without the other.",
        "Researchers have also noticed that nonverbal (gesture or gaze) information plays a role in setting the situational context which is useful in restricting the hypothesis space constructed during language processing.",

        "An anthropomorphic interface, such as Guides [Don et al., 1991], provides a means to realize a new style of interaction.",
        "Such research attempts to computationally capture the communicative power of the human face and apply it to human-computer dialogue.",
        "Our research is closely related to the last approach.",
        "The aim of this research is to improve human-computer dialogue by introducing human-like behavior into a speech dialogue system.",
        "Such behavior will include factors such as facial expressions and head and eye movement.",
        "It will help to reduce any stress experienced by users of computing systems, lowering the complexity associated with understanding system status.",
        "Like most dialogue systems developed by natural language researchers, our current system can handle domain-dependent, information-seeking dialogues.",
        "Of course, the system encounters problems with ambiguity and missing information (i.e., anaphora and ellipsis).",
        "The system tries to resolve them using techniques from natural language understanding (e.g., constraint-based, case-based.",
        "and plan-based methods).",
        "We are also studying the use of synergic multimodality to resolve linguistic problems, as in conventional multimodal systems.",
        "This work will be reported in a separate publication.",

        "Multimodal dialogues that combine verbal and nonverbal communication have been pursued",
        "mainly from the following three viewpoints.",
        "1.",
        "Combining direct manipulation with natural language (deictic) expressions",
        "\"Direct manipulation (DM)\" was suggested by Shneiderman [1983].",
        "The user can interact directly with graphical objects displayed on the computer screen with rapid, incremental, reversible operations whose effects on the objects of interest are immediately visible.",
        "The semantics of natural language (NL) expressions is anchored to real-world objects and events by means of pointing and demonstrating actions and deictic expressions such as \"this,\" \"that,\" \"here,\" \"there,\" \"then,\" and \"now.\"",
        "Some research on dialogue systems has combined deictic gestures and natural language such as Put-That-There [Bolt, 1980], CUBRICON [Neal et al., 1988], and ALFRESCO [Stock, 1991].",
        "One of the advantages of combined NL/DM interaction is that it can easily resolve the missing information in NL expressions.",
        "For example, when the system receives a user request in speech like \"delete that object,\" it can fill in the missing information by looking for a pointing gesture from the user or objects on the screen at the time the request is made.",
        "2.",
        "Using nonverbal inputs to specify the -7ontext and filter out unrelated information",
        "The focus of attention or the focal point plays a very important role in processing applications with a broad hypothesis space such as speech recognition.",
        "One example of focusing modality is following the user's looking behavior.",
        "Fixation or gaze is useful for the dialogue system to determine the context of the user's interest.",
        "For example, when a user is looking at a car, that the user says at that time may be related to the car.",
        "Prosodic information (e.g., voice tones) in the user's utterance also helps to determine focus.",
        "In this case, the system uses prosodic information to infer the user's beliefs or intentions.",
        "Combining gestural information with spoken language comprehension shows another example of how context may be determined by the user's nonverbal behavior [Oviatt et al., 19931.",
        "This research uses multimodal forms that prompt a user to speak or write into labeled fields.",
        "The forms are capable of guiding and segmenting inputs, of conveying the kind of information the system is expecting, and of reducing ambiguities in utterances by restricting syntactic and semantic complexities.",
        "3.",
        "Incorporating human-like behavior into dialogue systems to reduce operation complexity and stress often associated with computer systems Designing human-computer dialogue requires that the computer makes appropriate backchan-nel feedbacks like nodding or expressions such as \"aha\" and \"I see.\"",
        "One of the major advantages of using such nonverbal behavior in human-computer conversation is that reactions are quicker than those from voice-based responses.",
        "For example, the facial backchannel plays an important role in human face-to-face conversation.",
        "We consider such quick reactions as being situated actions [Suchman, 1987] which are necessary for resource-bounded dialogue participants.",
        "Timely responses are crucial to successful conversation, since some delay in reactions can imply specific meanings or make messages unnecessarily ambiguous.",
        "Generally, visual channels contribute to quick user recognition of system status.",
        "For example, the system's gaze behavior (head and eye movement) gives a strong impression of whether it is paying attention or not.",
        "If the system's eyes wander around aimlessly, the user easily recognizes the system's attention elsewhere, perhaps even unaware that he or she is speaking to it.",
        "Thus, gaze is an important indicator of system (in this case, speech recognition) status.",
        "By using human-like nonverbal behavior, the system can more flexibly respond to the user than is possible by using verbal modality alone.",
        "We focused on the third viewpoint and developed a system that acts like a human.",
        "We employed communicative facial expressions as a new modality in human-computer conversation.",
        "We have already discussed this, however, in another paper [Takeuchi and Nagao, 1993].",
        "Here, we consider our implemented system as a testbed for incorporating human-like (nonverbal) behavior into dialogue systems.",

        "First, preferences among the contexts are dynamically computed based on the facts and assumptions within each context.",

        "3.",
        "The experiments using facial displays F and those using short phrases N are compared.",
        "Contrary to our expectations, the result indicates that facial displays have little influence on successful conversation.",
        "This means that the learning effect, occurring over the duration of the experiments, is equal in effect to the facial displays.",
        "However, we believe that the effect of the facial displays will overtake the learning effect once the qualities of speech recognition and facial animation have been improved.",
        "The premature settings of the prototype system, and the strict restrictions imposed on the conversation inevitably detract from the potential advantages available from systems using communicative facial displays.",
        "We believe that further elaboration of the system will greatly improve the results.",
        "The subjects were relatively well-experienced in using computers.",
        "Experiments with computer novices should also be done.",
        "Concluding Remarks and Further Work Our experiments showed that facial displays are helpful, especially upon first contact with the system.",
        "It was also shown that early interaction with facial displays improves subsequent interaction, even though the subsequent interaction does not use facial displays.",
        "These results prove quantitatively that interfaces with facial displays help to break down the mental barrier that many users have toward computing systems.",
        "As a future research direction, we plan to integrate more communication channels and modalities.",
        "Among these, the prosodic information processing in speech recognition and speech synthesis are of special interest, as well as the recognition of users' gestures and facial displays.",
        "Also, further work needs to be done on the design and implementation of the coordination of multiple communication modalities.",
        "We believe that such coordination is an emergent phenomenon from the tight interaction between the system and its ever-changing environments (including humans and other interactive systems) by means of situated actions and (more deliberate) cooperative actions.",
        "Precise control of multiple coordinated activities is not, therefore, directly implementable.",
        "Only constraints or relationships among perception, conversational situations, and action will be implementable.",
        "To date, conversation with computing systems has been over-regulated conversation.",
        "This has been made necessary by communication being done through limited channels, making it necessary to avoid information collision in the narrow channels.",
        "Multiple channels reduce the necessity for conversational regulation, allowing new styles of conversation to appear.",
        "A new style of conversation has smaller granularity, is highly interruptible, and invokes more spontaneous utterances.",
        "Such conversation is closer to our daily conversation with families and friends, and this will further increase familiarity with computers.",
        "Co-constructive conversation, that is less constrained by domains or tasks, is one of our future goals.",
        "We are extending our conversational model to deal with a new style of human-computer interaction called social interaction [Nagao and Takeuchi, 1994] which includes co-constructive conversation.",
        "This style of conversation features a group of individuals where, say, those individuals talk about the food they ate together in a restraurant a month ago.",
        "There are no special roles (like the chairperson) for the participants to play.",
        "They all have the same role.",
        "The conversation terminates only once all the participants are satisfied with the conclusion.",
        "We are also interested in developing interactive characters and stories as an application for interactive entertainment.",
        "We are now building a conversational, anthropomorphic computer character that we hope will entertain us with some pleasant stories."
