        "The need to provide automated, efficient and accurate means of retrieving and extracting user-oriented biomedical knowledge has significantly increased according to the ever-increasing amount of knowledge pusblished daily in the form of research articles (Ananiadou and McNaught, 2006; Cohen and Hunter, 2008).",
        "Biomedical text mining has seen significant recent advancements in recent years (Zweigenbaum et al., 2007), including named entity recognition (Fukuda et al., 1998), coreference resolution (Batista-Navarro and Ananiadou, 2011; Savova et al., 2011) and relation (Miwa et al., 2009; Pyysalo et al., 2009) and event extraction (Miwa et al., 2012b; Miwa et al., 2012a).",
        "Using biomedical text mining technology, text can now be enriched via the addition of semantic metadata and thus can support tasks such as analysing molecular pathways (Rzhetsky et al., 2004) and semantic searching (Miyao et al., 2006).",
        "However, more complex tasks, such as question answering and automatic summarisation, require the extraction of information that spans across several sentences, together with the recognition of relations that exist across sentence boundaries, in order to achieve high levels of performance.",
        "The notion of discourse can be defined as a coherent sequence of clauses and sentences.",
        "These are connected in a logical manner by discourse relations, such as causal, temporal and conditional, which characterise how facts in text are related.",
        "In turn, these help readers infer deeper, more complex knowledge about the facts mentioned in the discourse.",
        "These relations can be either explicit or implicit, depending whether or not they are expressed in text using overt discourse connectives (also known as triggers).",
        "Take, for instance, the case in example (1), where the trigger Therefore signals a justification between the two sentences: because ?a normal response to mild acid pH from PmrB requires both a periplasmic histidine and several glutamic acid residues?, the authors believe that the ?regulation of PmrB activity could involve protonation of some amino acids?.",
        "but also several glutamic acid residues.",
        "Therefore, regulation of PmrB activity may involve protonation of one or more of these amino acids.",
        "Thus, by identifying this causal relation, search engines become able to discover relations between biomedical entities and events or between experimental evidence and associated conclusions.",
        "However, phrases acting as causal triggers in certain contexts may not denote causality in all cases.",
        "Therefore, a dictionary-based approach is likely to produce a very high number of false positives.",
        "In this paper, we explore several supervised machine-learning approaches to the automatic identification of triggers that actually denote causality."

        "A large amount of work related to discourse parsing and discourse relation identification exists in the general domain, where researchers have not only identified discourse connectives, but also developed end-to-end discourse parsers (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Lin et al., 2012).",
        "Most work is based on the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), a corpus of lexically-grounded annotations of discourse relations.",
        "Until now, comparatively little work has been carried out on causal discourse relations in the biomedical domain, although causal associations between biological entities, events and processes are central to most claims of interest (Kleinberg and Hripcsak, 2011).",
        "The equivalent of the PDTB for the biomedical domain is the BioDRB corpus (Prasad et al., 2011), containing 16 types of discourse relations, e.g., temporal, causal and conditional.",
        "The number of purely causal relations annotated in this corpus is 542.",
        "There are another 23 relations which are a mixture between causality and one of either background, temporal, conjunction or reinforcement relations.",
        "A slightly larger corpus is the BioCause (Miha?ila?",
        "et al., 2013), containing over 850 manually annotated causal discourse relations in 19 full-text open-access journal articles from the infectious diseases domain.",
        "Using the BioDRB corpus as data, some researchers explored the identification of discourse connectives (Ramesh et al., 2012).",
        "However, they do not distinguish between the types of discourse relations.",
        "They obtain the best F-score of 75.7% using CRF, with SVM reaching only 65.7%.",
        "These results were obtained by using only syntactic features, as sematic features were shown to lower the performance.",
        "Also, they prove that there exist differences in discourse triggers between the biomedical and general domains by training a model on the BioDRB and evaluating it against PDTB and vice-versa."

        "The lexical features are built from the actual tokens present in text.",
        "Tokenisation is performed by",
        "the token's surface expression and its base form.",
        "Neighbouring tokens have also been considered.",
        "We included the token immediately to the left and the one immediately to the right of the current token.",
        "This decision is based on two observations.",
        "Firstly, in the case of tokens to the left, most triggers are found either at the beginning of the sentence (311 instances) or are preceded by a comma (238 instances).",
        "These two left contexts represent 69% of all triggers.",
        "Secondly, for the tokens to the right, almost 45% of triggers are followed by a determiner, such as the, a or an, (281 instances) or a comma (71 instances).",
        "The syntax, dependency and predicate argument structure are produced by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008).",
        "Figure 2 depicts a partial lexical parse tree of a sentence which starts with a causal trigger, namely Our results suggest that.",
        "From the lexical parse trees, several types of features have been generated.",
        "The first two features represent the part-of-speech and syntactic category of a token.",
        "For instance, the figure shows that the token that has the part-of-speech IN.",
        "These features are included due to the fact that either many triggers are lexicalised as an adverb or conjunction, or are part of a verb phrase.",
        "For the same reason, the syntactical category path from the root of the lexical parse tree to the token is also included.",
        "The path also encodes, for each parent constituent, the position of the token in its sub-tree, i.e., beginning (B), inside (I) or end (E); if the token is the only leaf node of the constituent, this is marked differently, using a C. Thus, the path of that, highlighted in the figure, is I-S/I-VP/B-CP/C-CX.",
        "Secondly, for each token, we extracted the pred",
        "icate argument structure and checked whether a relation exista between the token and the previous and following tokens.",
        "The values for this feature represent the argument number as allocated by Enju.",
        "Thirdly, the ancestors of each token to the third degree are instantiated as three different features.",
        "In the case that such ancestors do not exist (i.e., the root of the lexical parse tree is less than three nodes away), a ?none?",
        "value is given.",
        "For instance, the token that in Figure 2 has as its first three ancestors the constituents marked with CX, CP and VP.",
        "Finally, the lowest common ancestor in the lexical parse tree between the current token and its left neighbour has been included.",
        "In the example, the lowest common ancestor for that and suggest is VP.",
        "These last two feature types have been produced on the observation that the lowest common ancestor for all tokens in a causal trigger is S or VP in over 70% of instances.",
        "Furthermore, the percentage of cases of triggers with V or ADV as lowest common ancestor is almost 9% in each case.",
        "Also, the aver",
        "age distance to the lowest common ancestor is 3.",
        "We have exploited several semantic knowledge sources to identify causal triggers more accurately, as a mapping to concepts and named entities acts as a back-off smoothing, thus increasing performance.",
        "One semantic knowledge source is the BioCause corpus itself.",
        "All documents annotated for causality in BioCause had been previously manually annotated with biomedical named entity and event information.",
        "This was performed in the context of various shared tasks, such as the BioNLP 2011 Shared Task on Infectious Diseases (Pyysalo et al., 2011).",
        "We therefore leverage this existing information to add another semantic layer to the model.",
        "Moreover, another advantage of having a gold standard annotation is the fact that it is now possible to separate the task of automatic causal trigger recognition from automatic named entity recognition and event extraction.",
        "The named entity and event annotation in the BioCause corpus is used to extract information about whether a token is part of a named entity or event trigger.",
        "Furthermore, the type of the named entity or event is included as a separate feature.",
        "The second semantic knowledge source is Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Using this resource, the hypernym of every token in the text has been included as a feature.",
        "Only the first sense of every token has been considered, as no sense disambiguation technique has been employed.",
        "Finally, tokens have been linked to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004) semantic types.",
