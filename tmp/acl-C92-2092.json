        "[Whitelock, 1991, this conference] we envisage the process of sentence generation as beginning from a multiset or bag of richly structured lexical signs rather than from a conventional logical form or other underlying structure.",
        "The translation equivalences are stated between sets of lexical signs, with the superstructure of non-terminal symbols being no more than the means by which monolingual grammars are implemented The work described here was motivated by a desire to improve on a correct but inefficient algorithm provided by Whitelock [Whitelock, 1991, this conference].",
        "We begin by introducing the problem, proceed by investigating its worst-case behaviour, and conclude by describing new algorithms for Shake-and-Bake generation.",
        "Since the linear order of the source language is not transferred into the bag, it is the business of the monolingual grammar writer to ensure that the word-order requirements of the target language are suitably encoded, and the business of the algorithm designer to ensure that this encoding is exploited as efficiently as possible.",
        "For an example of the grammar writer's responsibility, the difference between \"Mary likes Frances\" and \"Frances likes Mary\" can be encoded in the sharing of index variables between the proper nouns and the verb.",
        "For an example of the algorithm designer's responsibility, it would be a mistake (as Whitelock has noted) to provide a translation or generation algorithm which unintentionally unified the two index variables, leading to a reading in which \"Mary\" and \"Frances\" are alternative names for the same person."

        "We now provide a polynomial-time reduction from an arbitrary instance of MENAGE A TROIS to an instance of Shake-and-Bake generation, which allows the same conclusion to be drawn for this problem.",
        "We start by forming an input string S containing all the elements of the three sets A,B,C, in any order.",

        "To complete the grammar we need a final production of the form x--> , .",
        "The role of this production is to ensure that a parse can be achieved if and only if there is a way of covering the input string with constraints.",
        "The construction of the grammar and the input string is clearly a polynomial process.",
        "Context-free parsing has the property that a leaf node of the input string can only be directly dominated by one node of the final analysis tree, and by the definition of Shake-and-Bake generation given above the Shake-and-Bake process for G and S must succeed if and only if G admits, under the standard node-admissibility interpretation of context-free grammars, a string S1 which is a permutation of S. By combining the preparation described above with Shake-and-Bake generation, we obtain a solution of MENAGE A TROIS.",

        "The node numbers shown in Figure 5ff.",
        "correspond to those listed in Figure 4 .The structure is a directed graph, in which elements are linked if and only if they may stand in a functor/argument relationship.",

        "This helps to prune the search space, reducing the amount of unnecessary work carried out during generation.",
        "We know that each node of the structure must participate in exactly one functor/argument relationship, but in order to distinguish between those elements which may stand in such a relationship and those which actually form part of a complete solution, it is necessary to propagate constraints through the graph.",
        "In order to do this it is convenient to add construction lines linking signs in functor position to the corresponding signs which occur in their argument positions.",
        "In Figure 6 we can immediately see that node 3 must be connected to node 2, since there are no other links leading away from node 3.",
