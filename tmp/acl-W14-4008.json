        "We find that quality estimation using syntactic and semantic information on this data set can hardly improve over a baseline which uses only surface features.",

        "We also introduce a novel metric to measure translation adequacy based on predicate-argument structure match using word alignments.",
        "While word alignments can be reliably used, the two main factors affecting the performance of all semantic-based methods seems to be the low quality of semantic role labelling (especially on ill-formed text) and the lack of nominal predicate annotation."

        "The problem of evaluating machine translation output without reference translations is called quality estimation (QE) and has recently been the centre of attention (Bojar et al., 2014) following the seminal work of Blatz et al. (2003).",
        "Most QE studies have focused on surface and language-model-based features of the source and target.",
        "The quality of translation is however closely related to the syntax and semantics of the languages, the former concerning fluency and the latter adequacy.",
        "While there have been some attempts to utilize syntax in this task, semantics has been paid less attention.",
        "In this work, we aim to exploit both syntax and semantics in QE, with a particular focus on the latter.",
        "We use shallow semantic analysis obtained via semantic role labelling (SRL) and employ this information in QE in various ways including statistical learning using both tree kernels and hand-crafted features.",
        "We also design a QE metric which is based on the Predicate-Argument structure Match (PAM ) between the source and its translation.",
        "The semantic-based system is then combined with the syntax-based system to evaluate the full power of structural linguistic information.",
        "We also combine this system with a baseline system consisting of effective surface features.",
        "A second contribution of the paper is the release of a new data set for QE.",
        "1 This data set comprises a set of 4.5K sentences chosen from customer support forum text.",
        "The machine translation of the sentences are not only evaluated in terms of adequacy and fluency, but also manually post-edited allowing various metrics of interest to be applied to measure different aspects of quality.",
        "All experiments are carried out on this data set.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: after reviewing the related work, the data is described and the semantic role labelling approach is explained.",
        "The baseline is then introduced, followed by the experiments with tree kernels, hand-crafted features, the PAM metric and finally the combination of all methods.",
        "The paper ends with a summary and suggestions for future work.",
        "2 Related Work Syntax has been exploited in QE in various ways including tree kernels (Hardmeier et al., 2012; Kaljahi et al., 2013; Kaljahi et al., 2014b), parse probabilities and syntactic label frequency (Avramidis, 2012), parseability (Quirk, 2004) and POS n-gram scores (Specia and Gim?enez, 2010).",
        "1 The data will be made publicly available see http:// www.computing.dcu.ie/mt/confidentmt.html 67 Turning to the role of semantic knowledge in QE and MT evaluation in general, Pighin and M`arquez (2011) propose a method for ranking two translation hypotheses that exploits the projection of SRL from a sentence to its translation using word alignments.",
        "They first project the SRL of a source corpus to its parallel corpus and then build two translation models: 1) translations of proposition labelling sequences in the source to its projection in the target and 2) translations of argument role fillers in the source to their counterparts in the target.",
        "The source SRL is then projected to its machine translation and the above models are forced to translate source proposition labelling sequences to the projected ones.",
        "Finally the confidence scores of these translations and their reachability are used to train a classifier which selects the better of the two translation hypotheses with an accuracy of 64%.",
        "Factors hindering their classifier are word alignment limitations and low SRL recall due to the lack of a verb or the loss of a predicate during translation.",
        "In MT evaluation, where reference translations are available, Gim?enez and M`arquez (2007) use semantic roles in building several MT evaluation metrics which measure the full or partial lexical match between the fillers of same semantic roles in the hypothesis and translation, or simply the role label matches between them.",
        "They conclude that these features can only be useful in combination with other features and metrics reflecting different aspects of the quality.",
        "Lo and Wu (2011) introduce HMEANT, a manual MT evaluation metric based on predicate-argument structure matching which involves two steps of human engagement: 1) semantic role annotation of the reference and machine translation, 2) evaluating the translation of predicates and arguments.",
        "The metric calculates the F 1 score of the semantic frame match between the reference and machine translation based on this evaluation.",
        "To keep the costs reasonable, the first step is carried out by amateur annotators who were minimally trained with a simplified list of 10 thematic roles.",
        "On a set of 40 examples, the metric is meta-evaluated in terms of correlation with human judgements of translation adequacy ranking, and a correlation as high as that of HTER is reported.",
        "Lo et al. (2012) propose MEANT, a variant of HMEANT, which automatizes its manual steps using 1) automatic SRL systems for (only) verb predicates, 2) automatic alignment of predicates and their arguments in the reference and machine translation based on their lexical similarity.",
        "Once the predicates and arguments are aligned, their similarities are measured using a variety of methods such as cosine distance and even Meteor and BLEU.",
        "In computation of the final score, the similarity scores replace the counts of correct and partial translations used in HMEANT.",
        "This metric outperforms several automatic metrics including BLEU, Meteor and TER, but it significantly under-performs HMEANT and HTER.",
        "Further analysis shows that automatizing the second step does not affect the performance of MEANT.",
        "Therefore, it seems to be the lower accuracy of the semantic role labelling that is responsible.",
        "Bojar and Wu (2012) identify a set of flaws with HMEANT and propose solutions for them.",
        "The most important problems stem from the superficial SRL annotation guidelines.",
        "These problems are exacerbated in MEANT due to the automatic nature of the two steps.",
        "More recently, Lo et al. (2014) extend MEANT to ranking translations without a reference by using phrase translation probabilities for aligning semantic role fillers of the source and its translation.",
        "3 Data We randomly select 4500 segments from a large collection of Symantec English Norton forum text.",
        "2 In order to be independent of any one MT system, we translate these segments into French with the following three systems and randomly choose 1500 distinct segments from each.",

        "5 Each sentence translation is then scored against its post-edit using BLEU 6 (Papineni et al., 2002), TER (Snover et al., 2006) and METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), which are the most widely used MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Following Snover et al. (2006), we consider this way of scoring MT output to be a variation of human-targeted scoring, where no reference translation is provided to the post-editor, so we call them HBLEU, HTER and HMETEOR.",
        "The average scores for the entire data set together with their standard deviations are presented in Table 1.",
        "7 In the second method, we asked three professional translators, who are again native French speakers, to assess the quality of MT output in terms of adequacy and fluency in a 5-grade scale (LDC, 2002).",
        "The interpretation of the scores is given in Table 2.",
        "Each evaluator was given the entire data set for evaluation.",
        "We therefore collected three sets of scores and averaged them to obtain the final scores.",
        "The averages of these scores for the entire data set together with their standard deviations are presented in Table 1.",
        "To be easily comparable to human-targeted scores, we scale these scores to the [0,1] range, i.e. ad-equacy/fluency scores of 1 and 5 are mapped to 0 and 1 respectively and all the scores in between are accordingly scaled.",
        "The average Kappa inter-annotator agreement for adequacy scores is 0.25 and for fluency scores 0.19.",
        "However, this measurement does not differentiate between small and large differences in agreement.",

        "7 Note that HTER scores have no upper limit and can be higher than 1 when the number of errors is higher than the segment length.",
        "In addition, the higher HTER indicates lower translation quality.",
        "To be comparable to the other scores, we cut-off them at 1 and convert to 1-HTER.",

        "To account for this, we use weighted Kappa instead.",
        "Specifically, we consider two scores of difference 1 to represent 75% agreement instead of 100%.",
        "All the other differences are considered to be a disagreement.",
        "The average weighted Kappa computed in this way is 0.65 for adequacy and 0.63 for fluency.",
        "Though the weighting used is quite strict, the weighted Kappa values are in the substantial agreement range.",
        "Once we have both human-targeted and manual evaluation scores together, it is interesting to know how they are correlated.",
        "We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient r between each pair of the five scores and present them in Table 3.",
        "HBLEU has the highest correlation with both adequacy and fluency scores among the human-targeted metrics.",
        "HTER on the other hand has the lowest correlation.",
        "Moreover, HBLEU is more correlated with fluency than with adequacy which is the opposite to HMeteor.",
        "This is expected according to the definition of BLEU and Meteor.",
        "There is also a high correlation between adequacy and fluency scores.",
        "Although this could be related to the fact that both scores are from the same evaluators, it indicates that if either the fluency and adequacy of the MT output is low or high, the other tends to be the same.",
        "The data is split into train, development and test sets of 3000, 500 and 1000 sentences respectively.",
        "4 Semantic Role Labelling The type of semantic information we use in this work is the predicate-argument structure or semantic role labelling of the sentence.",
        "This information needs to be extracted from both sides of the translation, i.e. English and French.",
        "Though the SRL of English has been well-studied (M`arquez et al., 2008) thanks to the existence of two major hand-crafted resources, namely FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), French is one of the under-studied languages in 69 1-HTER HBLEU HMeteor Adequacy Fluency Average 0.6976 0.5517 0.7221 0.6230 0.4096 Standard Deviation 0.2446 0.2927 0.2129 0.2488 0.2780 Table 1: Average and standard deviation of the evaluation scores for the entire data set this respect mainly due to a lack of such resources.",
        "The only available gold standard resource is a small set of 1000 sentences taken from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and manually annotated with Prop-bank verb predicates (van der Plas et al., 2010).",
        "van der Plas et al. (2011) attempt to tackle this scarcity by automatically projecting SRL from the English side of a large parallel corpus to its French side.",
        "Our preliminary experiments (Kaljahi et al., 2014a), however, show that SRL models trained on the small manually annotated corpus have a higher quality than ones trained on the much larger projected corpus.",
        "We therefore use the 1K gold standard set to train a French SRL model.",
        "For En-glish, we use all the data provided in the CoNLL 2009 shared task (Haji?c et al., 2009).",
        "We use LTH (Bj?orkelund et al., 2009), a dependency-based SRL system, for both the English and French data.",
        "This system was among the best performing systems in the CoNLL 2009 shared task and is straightforward to use.",
        "It comes with a set of features tuned for each shared task language (English, German, Japanese, Spanish, Catalan, Czech, Chinese).",
        "We compared the performance of the English and Spanish feature sets on French and chose the former due to its higher performance (by 1 F 1 point).",
        "It should be noted that the English SRL data come with gold standard syntactic annotation.",
        "On the other hand, for our QE data set, such annotation is not available.",
        "Our preliminary experiments show that, since the SRL system heavily relies on syntactic features, the performance considerably drops when the syntactic annotation of the test data is obtained using a different parser than that of the training data.",
        "We therefore replace the parses of the training data with those obtained automatically by first parsing the data using the Lorg PCFG-LA parser 8 (Attia et al., 2010) and then converting them to dependencies using Stanford converter (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "The POS tags are also replaced with those output by the parser.",
        "For the same reason, we re-8 https://github.com/CNGLdlab/LORG-Release.",
        "place the original POS tagging of the French 1K data with those obtained by the MElt tagger (De- nis and Sagot, 2012).",
        "The English SRL achieves 77.77 and 67.02 labelled F 1 points when trained only on the training section of PropBank and tested on the WSJ and Brown test sets respectively.",
        "9 The French SRL is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on the 1K data set and obtains an F 1 average of 67.66.",
        "When applied to the QE data set, these models identify 9133, 8875 and 8795 propositions on its source side, post-edits and MT output respectively.",
        "5 Baseline We compare the results of our experiments to a baseline built using the 17 baseline features of the WMT QE shared task (Bojar et al., 2014).",
        "These features provide a strong baseline and have been used in all three years of the shared task.",
        "We use support vector regression implemented in the SVMLight toolkit 10 with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to build this baseline.",
        "To extract these features, a parallel English-French corpus is required to build a lexical translation table using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "We use the Europarl English-French parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) plus around 1M segments of Symantec translation memory.",
        "Table 4 shows the performance of this system (WMT17) on the test set measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r).",
        "We only report the results on predicting four of the metrics introduced above, omitting HMeteor due to space constraints.",
        "C and ?",
        "parameters are tuned on the development set with respect to r. The results show a significant difference between manual and human-targeted metric prediction.",
        "The higher r for the former suggests that the patterns of these scores are easier to learn.",
        "The RMSE seems to follow the standard deviation 9 Although the English SRL data are annotated for noun predicates as well as verb predicates, since the French data has only verb predicate annotations, we only consider verb predicates for English.",
        "10 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ 70 of the scores as the same ranking is seen in both.",
        "6 Tree Kernels Tree kernels (Moschitti, 2006) have been successfully used in QE by Hardmeier et al. (2012) and in our previous work (Kaljahi et al., 2013; Kaljahi et al., 2014b), where syntactic trees are employed.",
        "Tree kernels eliminate the burden of manual feature engineering by efficiently utilizing all subtrees of a tree.",
        "We employ both syntactic and semantic information in learning quality scores, using the SVMLight-TK 11 , a support vector machine (SVM) implementation of tree kernels.",
        "We implement a syntactic tree kernel QE system with constituency and dependency trees of the source and target side, following our previous work (Kaljahi et al., 2013; Kaljahi et al., 2014b).",
        "The performance of this system (TKSyQE) is shown in Table 4.",
        "Unlike our previous results, where the syntax-based system significantly outperformed the WMT17 baseline, TKSyQE can only beat the baseline in HTER and fluency prediction, with neither difference being statistically significant and it is below the baseline for HBLEU and adequacy prediction.",
        "12 It should be noted that in our previous work, a WMT News data set was used as the QE data set which, unlike our new data set, is well-formed and in the same domain as the parsers?",
        "training data.",
        "The discrepancy between our new and old results suggests that the performance is strongly dependent on the data set.",
        "Unlike syntactic parsing, semantic role labelling does not produce a tree to be directly used in the tree kernel framework.",
        "There can be various ways to accomplish this goal.",
        "We first try a method inspired by the PAS format introduced by Moschitti et al. (2006).",
        "In this format, a fixed number of nodes are gathered under a dummy root node as slots of one predicate and 6 arguments of a proposition (one tree per predicate).",
        "Each node dominates an argument label or a dummy label for the predicate, which in turn dominates the POS tag of the argument or the predicate lemma.",
        "If a proposition has more than 6 arguments they are ignored, if it has fewer than 6 arguments, the extra slots are attached to a dummy null label.",
        "Note that these trees are derived from the dependency-based SRL of both the source and target side (Figure 11 http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm 12 We use paired bootstrap resampling Koehn (2004) for statistical significance testing.",

        "We used syntactic and semantic QE systems via both tree kernels and hand-crafted features.",
        "We found it hard to improve over a baseline, albeit strong, using such information which is extracted by applying parsers and semantic role labellers on out-of-domain and unedited text.",
