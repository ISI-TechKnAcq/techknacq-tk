        "BRIDGING REFERENCES (BR) (Clark, 1977)– anaphoric expressions that cannot be resolved purely on the basis of string matching and thus require the reader to ’bridge’ the gap using commonsense inferences–are arguably the most interesting and, at the same time, the most challenging problem in anaphora resolution.",
        "Work such as (Poesio et al., 1998; Poesio et al., 2002; Poesio, 2003) provided an experimental confirmation of the hypothesis first put forward by Sidner (1979) that BRIDGING DESCRIPTIONS (BD)1 are more similar to pronouns than to other types of definite descriptions, in that they are sensitive to the local rather than the global focus (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "This previ-uous work also suggested that simply choosing the entity whose description is lexically closest to that of the bridging description among those in the current focus space gives poor results; in fact, better results are obtained by always choosing as ANCHOR of the bridging reference2 the first-mentioned entity of the previous sentence (Poesio, 2003).",
        "But neither source of information in isolation resulted in an accuracy over 40%.",
        "In short, this earlier work suggested that a combination of salience and lexical /",
        "commonsense information is needed to choose the most likely anchor; the problem remained of how to combine this information.",
        "In the work described in this paper, we used machine learning techniques to find the best combination of local focus features and lexical distance features, focusing on MEREOLOGICAL bridging references:3 references referring to parts of an object already introduced (the cabinet), such as the panels or the top (underlined) in the following example from the GNOME corpus (Poesio et al., 2004).",
        "(1) The combination of rare and expensive materials used on [this cabinet]i indicates that it was a particularly expensive commission.",
        "The four Japanese lacquer panels date from the mid to late 1600s and were created with a technique known as kijimaki-e. For this type of lacquer, artisans sanded plain wood to heighten its strong grain and used it as the background of each panel.",
        "They then added the scenic elements of landscape, plants, and animals in raised lacquer.",
        "Although this technique was common in Japan, such large panels were rarely incorporated into French eighteenth-century furniture.",
        "Heavy Ionic pilasters, whose copper-filled flutes give an added rich color and contrast to the gilt-bronze mounts, flank the panels.",

        "The use of different sources of lexical knowledge for resolving bridging references has been investigated in a series of papers by Poesio et al.",
        "all using as dataset the Bridging Descriptions (BDs) contained in the corpus used by Vieira and Poesio",
        "(2000).",
        "In these studies, the lexical distance between a BD and its antecedent was used to choose the anchor for the BD among the antecedents in the previous five sentences.",
        "In (Poesio et al., 1997; Vieira and Poesio, 2000) WordNet 1.6 was used as a lexical resource, with poor or mediocre results.",
        "These results were due in part to missing entries and / or relations; in part to the fact that because of the monotonic organization of information in WordNet, complex searches are required even to find apparently close associations (like that between wheel and car).",
        "Similar results using WordNet 1.6 were reported at around the same time by other groups - e.g., (Humphreys et al., 1997; Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1998) and have been confirmed by more recent studies studying both hyponymy (Markert et al., 2003) and more specifically mereological BDs.",
        "Poesio (2003) found that none of the 58 mereological references in the GNOME corpus (discussed below) had a direct mereological link to their anchor: for example, table is not listed as a possible holonym of drawer, nor is house listed as a possible holonym for furniture.",
        "Garcia-Almanza (2003) found that only 16 of these 58 mereological references could be resolved by means of more complex searches in WordNet, including following the hypernymy hierarchy for both the anchor and the bridging reference, and a ’spreading activation’ search.",
        "Poesio et al.",
        "(1998) explored the usefulness of vector-space representations of lexical meaning for BDs that depended on lexical knowledge about hyponymy and synonymy.",
        "The HAL model discussed in Lund et al.",
        "(1995) was used to find the anchor of the BDs in the dataset already used by Poesio et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "However, using vectorial representations did not improve the results for the ‘WordNet’ BDs: for the synonymy cases the results were comparable to those obtained with WordNet (4/12, 33%), but for the hyponymy BDs (2/14, as opposed to 8/14 with WordNet) and especially for mereological references (2/12) they were clearly worse.",
        "On the other hand, the post-hoc analysis of results suggested that the poor results were in part due to the lack of mechanisms for choosing the most salient (or most recent) BDs.",
        "The poor results for mereological BDs with both WordNet and vectorial representations indicated that a different approach was needed to acquire information about part-of relations.",
        "Grefenstette’s work on semantic similarity (Grefenstette, 1993) and Hearst’s work on acquiring taxonomic information (Hearst, 1998) suggested that certain syntactic constructions could be usefully viewed as reflecting underlying semantic relations.",
        "In (Ishikawa, 1998; Poesio et al., 2002) it was proposed that syntactic patterns (henceforth: CONSTRUCTIONS) such as the wheel of the car could indicate that wheel and car stood in a part-of relation.4 Vector-based lexical representations whose elements encoded the strength of associations identified by means of constructions like the one discussed were constructed from the British National Corpus, using Abney’s CASS chunker.",
        "These representations were then used to choose the anchor of BDs, using again the same dataset and the same methods as in the previous two attempts, and using mutual information to determine the strength of association.",
        "The results on mereological BDs–recall .67, precision=.73–were drastically better than those obtained with WordNet or with simple vectorial representations.",
        "The results with the three types of lexical resources and the different types of BDs in the Vieira / Poesio dataset are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Finally, a number of researchers recently argued for using the Web as a way of addressing data sparseness (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "The Web has proven a useful resource for work in anaphora resolution as well.",

        "One of the motivations behind Grosz and Sidner’s (1986) distinction between two aspects of the attentional state - the LOCAL FOCUS and the GLOBAL FOCUS–is the difference between the interpretive preferences of pronouns and definite descriptions.",
        "According to Grosz and Sidner, the interpretation for pronouns is preferentially found in the local focus, whereas that of definite descriptions is preferentially found in the global focus.",
        "However, already Sidner (1979) hypothesized that BDs are different from other definite descriptions, in that the local focus is preferred for their interpretation.",
        "As already mentioned, the error analysis of Poesio et al.",
        "(1998) supported this finding: the study found that the strategy found to be optimal for anaphoric definite descriptions by Vieira and Poesio (2000), considering as equally likely all antecedents in the previous five-sentence window (as opposed to preferring closer antecedents), gave poor results for bridging references; entities introduced in the last two sentences and ‘main entities’ were clearly preferred.",
        "The following example illustrates how the local focus affects the interpretation of a mereological BD, the sides, in the third sentence.",
        "(2) [Cartonnier (Filing Cabinet)]i with Clock",
        "[This piece of mid-eighteenth-century furniture]i was meant to be used like a modern filing cabinet; papers were placed in [leather-fronted cardboard boxes] j (now missing) that were fitted into the open shelves.",
        "[A large table]k decorated in the same manner would have been placed in front for working with those papers.",
        "Access to [the cartonnier]i’s lower half can only be gained by the doors at the sides, because the table would have blocked the front.",
        "The three main candidate anchors in this example– the cabinet, the boxes, and the table–all have sides.",
        "However, the actual anchor, the cabinet, is clearly the Backward-Looking Center (CB) (Grosz et al., 1995) of the first sentence after the title;5 and if we assume that entities can be indirectly realized– see (Poesio et al., 2004)–the cabinet is the CB of all three sentences, including the one containing the BR, and therefore a preferred candidate.",
        "In (Poesio, 2003), the impact on associative BD resolution of both relatively simple salience features (such as distance and order or mention) and of more complex ones (such as whether the anchor was a CB or not) was studied using the GNOME corpus (discussed below) and the CB-tracking techniques developed to compare alternative ways of instantiating",
        "the parameters of Centering by Poesio et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "Poesio (2003) analyzed, first of all, the distance between the BD and the closest mention of the anchor, finding that of the 169 associative BDs, 77.5% had an anchor occurring either in the same sentence (59) or the previous one (72); and that only 4.2% of anchors were realized more than 5 sentences back.",
        "These percentages are very similar to those found with pronouns (Hobbs, 1978).",
        "Next, Poesio analyzed the order of mention of the anchors of the 72 associative BD whose anchor was in the previous sentence, finding that 49/72, 68%, were realized in first position.",
        "This finding is consistent with the preference for first-mentioned entities (as opposed to the most recent ones) repeatedly observed in the psychological literature on anaphora (Gernsbacher and Hargreaves, 1988; Gordon et al., 1993).",
        "Finally, Poesio examined the hypothesis that finding the anchor of a BD involves knowing which entities are the CB and the CP in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "He found that CB(U-1) is the anchor of 37/72 of the BDs whose anchor is in the previous utterance (51.3%), and only 33.6% overall.",
        "(CP(U-1) was the anchor for 38.2% associative BDs.)",
        "Clearly, simply choosing the CB (or the CP) of the previous sentence as the anchor doesn’t work very well.",
        "However, Poesio also found that 89% of the anchors of associative BDs had been CBs or CPs.",
        "This suggested that while knowing the local focus isn’t sufficient to determine the anchor of a BD, restricting the search for anchors to CBs and CPs only might increase the precision of the BD resolution process.",
        "This hypothesis was supported by a preliminary test with 20 associative BDs.",
        "The anchor for a BD with head noun NBD was chosen among the subset of all potential antecedents (PA) in the previous five sentences that had been CBs or CPs by calling Google (by hand) with the query “the NBD of the NPA”, where NPA is the head noun of the potential antecedent, and choosing the PA with the highest hit count.",

        "It’s also conforting to note that results with the harder test improve the more data are used, which suggests that better results could be obtained with a larger corpus."

        "In recent years there has been a lot of work to develop anaphora resolution algorithms using both symbolic and statistical methods that could be quantitatively evaluated (Humphreys et al., 1997; Ng and Cardie, 2002) but this work focused on identity relations; bridging references were explicitly excluded from the MUC coreference task because of the problems with reliability discussed earlier.",
        "Thus, most work on bridging has been theoretical, like the work by Asher and Lascarides (1998).",

        "The two main results of this study are, first of all, that combining ’salience’ features with ’lexical’ features leads to much better results than using either method in isolation; and that these results are an improvement over those previously reported in the literature.",
        "A secondary, but still interesting, result is that using WordNet in a different way –taking advantage of its extensive information about hypernyms to obviate its lack of information about meronymy–obviates the problems previously reported in the literature on using WordNet for resolving mereological bridging references, leading to results comparable to those obtained using Google.",
        "(Of course, from a practical perspective Google may still be preferrable, particularly for languages for which no WordNet exists.)",
        "The main limitation of the present work is that the number of BDs and BRs considered, while larger than in our previous studies, is still fairly small.",
        "Unfortunately, creating a reasonably accurate gold standard for this type of semantic interpretation process is slow work.",
        "Our first priority will be therefore to extend the data set, including also the original cases studied by Poesio and Vieira.",
        "Current and future work will also include incorporating the methods tested here in an actual anaphora resolution system, the GUITAR system (Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004).",
        "We are also working on methods for automatically recognizing bridging descriptions, and dealing with other types of (non-associative) bridging references based on synonymy and hyponymy."
