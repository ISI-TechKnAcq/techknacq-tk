        "In order to extract entities of a fine-grained category from semi-structured data in web pages, existing information extraction systems rely on seed examples or redundancy across multiple web pages.",
        "In this paper, we consider a new zero-shot learning task of extracting entities specified by a natural language query (in place of seeds) given only a single web page.",
        "Our approach defines a log-linear model over latent extraction predicates, which select lists of entities from the web page.",
        "The main challenge is to define features on widely varying candidate entity lists.",
        "We tackle this by abstracting list elements and using aggregate statistics to define features.",
        "Finally, we created a new dataset of diverse queries and web pages, and show that our system achieves significantly better accuracy than a natural baseline."

        "We consider the task of extracting entities of a given category (e.g., hiking trails) from web pages.",
        "Previous approaches either (i) assume that the same entities appear on multiple web pages, or (ii) require information such as seed examples (Etzioni et al., 2005; Wang and Cohen, 2009; Dalvi et al., 2012).",
        "These approaches work well for common categories but encounter data sparsity problems for more specific categories, such as the products of a small company or the dishes at a local restaurant.",
        "In this context, we may have only a single web page that contains the information we need and no seed examples.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel task, zero-shot entity extraction, where the specification of the desired entities is provided as a natural language query.",
        "Given a query (e.g., hiking seedsAvalon Super LoopHilton Area traditional answersAvalon Super LoopHilton AreaWildlands Loop... queryhiking trailsnear Baltimore our system answersAvalon Super LoopHilton AreaWildlands Loop... web pagesweb pagesweb pages web page Figure 1: Entity extraction typically requires additional knowledge such as a small set of seed examples or depends on multiple web pages.",
        "In our setting, we take as input a natural language query and extract entities from a single web page.",
        "trails near Baltimore) and a web page (e.g., http://www.everytrail.com/best/ hiking-baltimore-maryland), the goal is to extract all entities corresponding to the query on that page (e.g., Avalon Super Loop, etc.).",
        "Figure 1 summarizes the task setup.",
        "The task introduces two challenges.",
        "Given a single web page to extract entities from, we can no longer rely on the redundancy of entities across multiple web pages.",
        "Furthermore, in the zero-shot learning paradigm (Larochelle et al., 2008), where entire categories might be unseen during training, the system must generalize to new queries and web pages without the additional aid of seed examples.",
        "To tackle these challenges, we cast the task as a structured prediction problem where the input is the query and the web page, and the output is a list of entities, mediated by a latent extraction predicate.",
        "To generalize across different inputs, we rely on two types of features: structural fea-tures, which look at the layout and placement of the entities being extracted; and denotation fea-391 tures, which look at the list of entities as a whole and assess their linguistic coherence.",
        "When defining features on lists, one technical challenge is being robust to widely varying list sizes.",
        "We approach this challenge by defining features over a histogram of abstract tokens derived from the list elements.",
        "For evaluation, we created the OPENWEB dataset comprising natural language queries from the Google Suggest API and diverse web pages returned from web search.",
        "Despite the variety of queries and web pages, our system still achieves a test accuracy of 40.5% and an accuracy at 5 of 55.8%.",
        "2 Problem statement We define the zero-shot entity extraction task as follows: let x be a natural language query (e.g., hiking trails near Baltimore), and w be a web page.",
        "Our goal is to construct a mapping from (x,w) to a list of entities y (e.g., [Avalon Super Loop, Patapsco Valley State Park, .",
        ".",
        ". ])",
        "which are extracted from the web page.",
        "Ideally, we would want our data to be annotated with the correct entity lists y, but this would be very expensive to obtain.",
        "We instead define each training and test example as a triple (x,w, c), where the compatibility function c maps each y to c(y) ?",
        "{0, 1} denoting the (approximate) correctness of the list y.",
        "In this paper, an entity list y is compatible (c(y) = 1) when the first, second, and last elements of y match the annotation; otherwise, it is incompatible (c(y) = 0).",
        "2.1 Dataset To experiment with a diverse set of queries and web pages, we created a new dataset, OPENWEB, using web pages from Google search results.",
        "1 We use the method from Berant et al. (2013) to generate search queries by performing a breadth-first search over the query space.",
        "Specifically, we use the Google Suggest API, which takes a partial query (e.g., ?list of movies?)",
        "and outputs several complete queries (e.g., ?list of horror movies?).",
        "We start with seed partial queries ?list of ?",
        "?",
        "where ?",
        "is one or two initial letters.",
        "In each step, we call the Google Suggest API on the partial queries to obtain complete queries, 1 The OPENWEB dataset and our code base are available for download at http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/ software/web-entity-extractor-ACL2014.",
        "Full query New partial queries list of X IN Y list of X where IN is a preposition list of X (list of [hotels] X in [Guam] Y ) list of X IN list of IN Y list of X CC Y list of X where CC is a conjunction list of X (list of [food] X and [drink] Y ) list of Y list of Y list of X w list of w (list of [good 2012] X [movies] w ) list of w list of X Table 1: Rules for generating new partial queries from complete queries.",
        "(X and Y are sequences of words; w is a single word.)",
        "and then apply the transformation rules in Table 1 to generate more partial queries from complete queries.",
        "We run the procedure until we obtained 100K queries.",
        "Afterwards, we downloaded the top 2?3 Google search results of each query, sanitized the web pages, and randomly submitted 8000 query / web page pairs to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).",
        "Each AMT worker must either mark the web page as irrelevant or extract the first, second, and last entities from the page.",
        "We only included examples where at least two AMT workers agreed on the answer.",
        "The resulting OPENWEB dataset consists of 2773 examples from 2269 distinct queries.",
        "Among these queries, there are 894 headwords ranging from common categories (e.g., movies, companies, characters) to more specific ones (e.g., enzymes, proverbs, headgears).",
        "The dataset contains web pages from 1438 web domains, of which 83% appear only once in our dataset.",
        "Figure 2 shows some queries and web pages from the OPENWEB dataset.",
        "Besides the wide range of queries, another main challenge of the dataset comes from the diverse data representation formats, including complex tables, grids, lists, headings, and paragraphs.",
        "3 Approach Figure 3 shows the framework of our system.",
        "Given a query x and a web page w, the system generates a set Z(w) of extraction predicates z which can extract entities from semi-structured data in w. Section 3.1 describes extraction predicates in more detail.",

        "The system uses the input query x and web page w to produce a list of entities y via an extraction predicate z. w to get the list of entities y = JzK w .",
        "Section 3.2 describes the model and the training procedure, while Section 3.3 presents the features used in our model.",
        "3.1 Extraction predicates We represent each web page w as a DOM tree, a common representation among wrapper induction and web information extraction systems (Sahuguet and Azavant, 1999; Liu et al., 2000; Crescenzi et al., 2001).",
        "The text of any DOM tree node that is shorter than 140 characters is a candidate entity.",
        "However, without further restrictions, the number of possible entity lists grows exponentially with the number of candidate entities.",
        "To make the problem tractable, we introduce an extraction predicate z as an intermediate representation for extracting entities from w. In our sys-tem, we let an extraction predicate be a simplified XML path (XPath) such as /html[1]/body[1]/table[2]/tr/td[1] Informally, an extraction predicate is a list of path entries.",
        "Each path entry is either a tag (e.g., tr), which selects all children with that tag; or a tag and an index i (e.g., td[1]), which selects only the ith child with that tag.",
        "The denotation y = JzK w of an extraction predicate z is the list of entities selected by the XPath.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates the execution of the extraction predicate above on a DOM tree.",
        "In the literature, many information extraction systems employ more versatile extraction predicates (Wang and Cohen, 2009; Fumarola et al., 2011).",
        "However, despite the simplicity, we are able to find an extraction predicate that extracts a compatible entity list in 69.7% of the development examples.",
        "In some examples, we cannot extract a compatible list due to unrecoverable issues such as incorrect annotation.",
        "Section 4.4 provides a detailed analysis of these issues.",
        "Additionally, extraction predicates can be easily extended to increase the coverage.",
        "For example, by introducing new index types [1:] (selects all but the first node) and [:-1] (selects all but the last node), we can increase the coverage to 76.2%.",
        "Extraction predicate generation.",
        "We generate a set Z(w) of extraction predicates for a given web page w as follows.",
        "For each node in the DOM tree, we find an extraction predicate which selects only that node, and then generalizes the predicate by removing any subset of the indices of the last k path entries.",
        "For in-stance, when k = 2, an extraction predicate ending in .../tr[5]/td[2] will be generalized to .../tr[5]/td[2], .../tr/td[2], .../tr[5]/td, and .../tr/td.",
        "In all ex-periments, we use k = 8, which gives at most 2 8 generalized predicates for each original predicate.",
        "This generalization step allows the system to select multiple nodes with the same structure (e.g., 393 DOM tree w html head body table tr td Home.. td Expl.. td Mobi.. td Crea.. h1 Hiki.. table tr th Name.. th Loca.. tr td Aval.. td 12.7.. ... tr td Gove.. td 3.1 ..Extraction predicate z/html[1]/body[1]/table[2]/tr/td[1] Rendered web page Home Explore Mobile Apps Create TripHiking near Baltimore, MarylandName LengthAvalon Super Loop 12.7 milesHilton Area 7.8 milesAvalon Loop 9.4 milesWildlands Loop 4.4 milesMckeldin Area 16.7 milesGreenbury Point 3.7 milesGoverner Bridge Natural Area 3.1 miles Figure 4: A simplified example of a DOM tree w and an extraction predicate z, which selects a list of entity strings y = JzK w from the page (highlighted in red).",
        "table cells from the same column or list items from the same section of the page).",
        "Out of all generalized extraction predicates, we retain the ones that extract at least two entities from w. Note that several extraction predicates may select the same list of nodes and thus produce the same list of entities.",
        "The procedure above gives a manageable number of extraction predicates.",

        "For example, many Wikipedia articles have the See Also section that lists related articles in an unordered list (/ul/li/a), which causes a problem when the entities are also represented in the same format.",
        "Another main source of errors is the inconsistency in HTML tag usage (Reason C2).",
        "For instance, some web pages use <b> and <strong> tags for bold texts interchangeably, or switch between <b><a>...</a></b> and <a><b>...</b></a> across entities.",
        "We expect that this problem can be solved by normalizing the web page, using an alternative web page representation (Cohen et al., 2002; Wang and Co-hen, 2009; Fumarola et al., 2011), or leveraging more expressive extraction predicates (Dalvi et al., 2011).",

        "Table 6 shows that this augmentation increases accuracy from 41.1% to 52.9%, suggesting that our system can perform substantially better with a small amount of additional supervision.",
        "5 Discussion Our work shares a base with the wrapper induction literature (Kushmerick, 1997) in that it lever-ages regularities of web page structures.",
        "However, wrapper induction usually focuses on a small set of web domains, where the web pages in each domain follow a fixed template (Muslea et al., 2001; Crescenzi et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2002; Arasu and Garcia-Molina, 2003).",
        "Later work in web data extraction attempts to generalize across different web pages, but relies on either restricted data formats (Wong et al., 2009) or prior knowledge of web page structures with respect to the type of data to extract (Zhang et al., 2013).",
        "In our case, we only have the natural language query, which presents the more difficult problem of associating the entity class in the query (e.g., hiking trails) to concrete entities (e.g., Avalon Super Loop).",
        "In contrast to information extraction systems that extract homogeneous records from web pages (Liu et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2009), our system must choose the correct field from each record and also identify the relevant part of the page based on the query.",
        "Another related line of work is information extraction from text, which relies on natural language patterns to extract categories and relations of entities.",
        "One classic example is Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005), which can learn new entities and extraction patterns from seed examples.",
        "More recent approaches also leverage semi-structured data to obtain more robust extraction patterns (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoff-mann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Riedel et al., 2013).",
        "Although our work focuses on semi-structured web pages rather than raw text, we use linguistic patterns of queries and entities as a signal for extracting appropriate answers.",
        "Additionally, our efforts can be viewed as building a lexicon on the fly.",
        "In recent years, there has been a drive to scale semantic parsing to large databases such as Freebase (Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013).",
        "However, despite the best efforts of information extraction, such databases will always lag behind the open web.",
        "For example, Berant et al. (2013) found that less than 10% of naturally occurring questions are answerable by a simple Freebase query.",
        "By using the semi-structured data from the web as a knowledge base, we hope to increase fact coverage for semantic parsing.",
        "Finally, as pointed out in the error analysis, we need to filter or aggregate the selected entities for complex queries (e.g., tech companies in China for a web page with all Asian tech companies).",
        "In future work, we would like to explore the issue of compositionality in queries by aligning linguistic structures in natural language with the relative position of entities on web pages.",
