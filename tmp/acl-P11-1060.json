        "There are three types of predicates in P: generic (e.g., argmax), data (e.g., city), and value (e.g., ca).",

        "SemResp requires a lexicon of 1.42 words per non-value predicate, WordNet features, and syntactic parse trees; dcs requires only words for the domain-independent predicates (overall, around 0.5 words per non-value predicate), POS tags, and very simple indicator features.",

        "The lexicon encodes information about how each word can used in context; for example, the lexical entry for borders is s\\np/np : Ay.Ax.border(x, y), which means borders looks right for the first argument and left for the second.",
        "These rules are often too stringent, and for complex utterances, especially in free wordorder languages, either disharmonic combinators are employed (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) or words are given multiple lexical entries (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010).",
        "In DCS, we start with lexical triggers, which are more basic than CCG lexical entries.",
        "A trigger for borders specifies only that border can be used, but not how.",
        "The combination rules are encoded in the features as soft preferences.",
        "This yields a more factorized and flexible representation that is easier to search through and parametrize using features.",
        "It also allows us to easily add new lexical triggers without becoming mired in the semantic formalism.",
        "Quantifiers and superlatives significantly complicate scoping in lambda calculus, and often type raising needs to be employed.",
        "In DCS, the mark-execute construct provides a flexible framework for dealing withscope variation.",
        "Think ofDCS as ahigher-level programming language tailored to natural language, which results in programs (DCS trees) which are much simpler than the logically-equivalent lambda calculus formulae.",
        "The idea of using CSPs to represent semantics is inspired by Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Kamp et al., 2005), where variables are discourse referents.",
        "The restriction to trees is similar to economical DRT (Bos, 2009).",
