        "These rules are often too stringent, and for complex utterances, especially in free wordorder languages, either disharmonic combinators are employed (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) or words are given multiple lexical entries (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010).",

        "A trigger for borders specifies only that border can be used, but not how.",
        "The combination rules are encoded in the features as soft preferences.",
        "This yields a more factorized and flexible representation that is easier to search through and parametrize using features.",
        "It also allows us to easily add new lexical triggers without becoming mired in the semantic formalism.",
