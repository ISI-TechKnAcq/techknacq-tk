        "Geospatial display systems are increasingly gaining attention, given the large amounts of geospatial data and services available online.",
        "Although geos-patial imagery and maps show geometric relations among entities, they cannot be used to present other kinds of knowledge about the temporal, topic, and other conceptual relations and entities.",
        "Given an entity on a map, a description of what happened there, in what order in time, when, and why, requires additional types of information, typically contained in text, in order to support varied search and decision tasks.",
        "In this demo, we apply text summarization to a geo-spatial information display system with potentially large amounts of textual data.",
        "By summarizing the textual material linked to each location, we demonstrate the ways one can organize this material for optimal display and search.",
        "Of the many different types of text-oriented resources available, some are structured and others unstructured.",
        "This textual data can be linked to locations based on different reasons (containing place names, addresses, real objects with geographical features, etc.).",
        "Appropriately grouping and presenting the different aspects of the textual information in summarization is a challenging task.",
        "A second challenge stems from the huge amounts of web material related to some geographical objects.",
        "For example, one may find millions of pages for a famous place or event at a specific map location.",
        "Given the common limitations of display space in most geospatial display systems, one must also design the interface to support dynamic browsing and search.",
        "All these challenges bring new problems to existing summarization techniques.",
        "In the following sections, we demonstrate a hierarchical summarization framework that reduces displayed text and fully utilizes the small display space available for textual information."

        "Associating each news page individually to its lo-cation(s) may overwhelm the amount of information displayable at any point and thereby limit the scalability of the system.",
        "Existing systems presented in (Teitler et al., 2008) and GeoTracker (Chen et al., 2007) organize material (at the area level) by time instead of somehow aggregating over larger numbers of related content.",
        "Since frequently the associated news contents overlap at least in part, a natural solution is to aggregate the content somehow to remove duplication.",
        "Moreover, the aggregation of news provides a global view of the textual information about the specific location.",
        "Our system is the first available geo-spatial text aggregation system to our knowledge.",
        "Within geospatial display systems, the space available to display textual information is often quite limited.",
        "We therefore need to summarize the most important and relevant information about each location, drawing from all the web pages linked to it.",
        "However, directly applying a multi-document summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2001) to the web pages will generate poor results, due to unrelated titles, duplicate articles, and noisy contents contained in web pages.",
        "When several different events have occurred at a location, more than one distinct summary may be needed.",
        "It is therefore important to deploy topic recognition (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and/or topic clustering (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) to identify and group relevant pieces of each text into single-topic 'chunks'.",

        "Multi-webpage summarization is different from traditional multi-doc summarization.",
        "First, most web pages are much more complex than pure text documents.",
        "Since the web contains a combination of types of information – static text, image, videos, dynamic layout, etc. – even a single page can be treated as multiple documents.",
        "Current linking functions are based on keywords, making the relevant content of each relevant web page only a limited block within the page.",
        "Second, our task is oriented to locations, and hence differs from general content summarization.",
        "Hence, we need to identify and extract the essential part(s) of the webpage linked to the geospatial imagery for summarization and display.",
        "In our work, we utilize two important features, layout and semantics, to identify and extract the relevant content.",
        "By rendering each web page into a DOM tree, we segment the page into large blocks based on its layout, including header, footer, left bar, right bar, main block, etc.",
        "We implemented a rule-based extractor to extract the most relevant block from the web page based on the relevance to the location.",
        "Given a list of text blocks relevant to a local point of interest, one can employ traditional text summarization techniques to produce a short summary for each one.",
        "This solution may not be helpful, however, since a long list of pages associated with each point of interest would be very hard for users to browse.",
        "Especially when the space allocated to text display by the geospatial system is also limited, a high compression ratio is typically required for the summarization system.",
        "The solution we adopt is to deploy cluster-based multi-document summarization.",
        "Clustering must observe two criteria: first, the location of interest, and second, the text topic.",
        "Different clustering methods can be employed.",
        "To delimit topics, a simple heuristic is to introduce as additional criterion the event/article date: when the difference in document dates within a topical cluster is (far) larger than the actual duration of the topic event, we are probably dealing with multiple separate events at the same location.",
        "Better performance is obtained by using a topic detection module first, and then clustering documents based on the topics identified.",
        "Unfortunately, documents usually contain multiple locations and multiple topics.",
        "The problem of 'topic drift' can cause confusion in a short summary.",
        "As in (Hearst, 1997), we segment each document into several 'mini-documents', each one devoted to a single topic, and then to perform location-and topic-based clustering over the (now larger) set of mini-documents.",
        "Whatever the clustering approach, the result is a potentially rather large set of individual topics associated with each location.",
        "Since screen space for the summaries may be very limited next to the maps / imagery, they have to be formatted and presented for maximal interpretability.",
        "To address this problem, we adopt a hierarchical structure to display incrementally longer summaries for each location of interest.",
        "At present we have found three levels of incrementally longer summaries to be most useful.",
        "Thumbnail: a very short 'topic' that characterizes the (clusters of) documents or segments associated with each location.",
        "We present essentially one or two single keywords -- the most informative words for each cluster.",
        "We implemented a new version of our topic signature technology, one that uses tf.idf instead of the entropy ratio, as scoring measure to rank each cluster's words.",
        "Title: a headline-length phrase or short sentence (or two).",
        "The original titles of the web pages are often noisy or even unrelated to the current topic cluster.",
        "Sometimes, the title may be meaningless (it might for example contain the website's name \"Pr Newswire\"), or two different web pages may share the same title.",
        "We implemented a topic-related headline generator based on our previous work (Lin and Hovy, 2000) by incorporating a topic-based selector.",
        "Snippet: a paragraph-length excerpt characterizing the cluster.",
        "To produce paragraph-length summaries, we implemented an extraction-based text summarizer.",
