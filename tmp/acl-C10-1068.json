        "Coreference resolution aims to identify which noun phrases (NPs, or mentions) refer to the same real-world entity in a text.",
        "According to Webber (1979), coreference resolution can be decomposed into two complementary sub-tasks: (1) anaphoricity determination, determining whether a given NP is anaphoric or not; and (2) anaphor resolution, linking together multiple mentions of a given entity in the world.",
        "Although machine learning approaches have performed reasonably well in coreference resolution without explicit anaphoricity determination (e.g.",
        "Soon et al.",
        "2001; Ng and Cardie 2002b; Yang et al.",
        "2003, 2008; Kong et al.",
        "2009), knowledge of NP anaphoricity is expected to much improve the performance of a coreference resolution system, since a non-anaphoric NP does not have an antecedent and therefore does not need to be resolved.",
        "Recently, anaphoricity determination has been drawing more and more attention.",
        "One common approach involves the design of some heuristic rules to identify specific types of non-anaphoric NPs, such as pleonastic it (e.g. Paice and Husk 1987; Lappin and Leass 1994, Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Denber 1998) and definite descriptions (e.g. Vieira and Poe-sio 2000).",
        "Alternatively, some studies focus on using statistics to tackle this problem (e.g., and others apply machine learning approaches (e.g. Evans 2001;Ng and Cardie 2002a, 2004,2009; Yang et al.",
        "2005; Denis and Bal-bridge 2007; Luo 2007; Finkel and Manning 2008; Zhou and Kong 2009).",
        "As a representative, Zhou and Kong (2009) directly employ a tree kernel-based method to automatically mine the non-anaphoric information embedded in the syntactic parse tree.",
        "One main advantage of the kernel-based methods is that they are very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineering for structured objects.",
        "Indeed, the kernel-based methods have been successfully applied to mine structured information in various NLP applications like syntactic parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Moschitti, 2004), semantic relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhou et al.",
        "2007; Qian et al., 2008), semantic role labeling (Moschitti, 2004); corefer-ence resolution (Yang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008).",

        "This section briefly overviews the related work on both anaphoricity determination and exploring syntactic parse tree structures.",
        "Previous work on anaphoricity determination can be broadly divided into three categories: heuristic rule-based (e.g. Paice and Husk 1987;Lappin and Leass 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Denber 1998; Vieira and Poe-sio 2000; Cherry and Bergsma 2005), statistics-based (e.g. Bean and Riloff 1999; Cherry and Bergsma 2005; Bergsma et al.",
        "2008) and learning-based methods (e.g. Evans 2001; Ng and Manning 2008; Zhou and Kong 2009; Ng 2009).",
        "The heuristic rule-based methods focus on designing some heuristic rules to identify specific types of non-anaphoric NPs.",
        "Representative work includes: Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).",
        "For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) looked for modal adjectives (e.g. \"necessary\") or cognitive verbs (e.g. \"It is thought that...\" in a set of patterned constructions) in identifying pleonastic it.",
        "Among the statistics-based methods, Bean and Riloff (1999) automatically identified existential definite NPs which are non-anaphoric.",
        "The intuition behind is that many definite NPs are not anaphoric since their meanings can be understood from general world knowledge, e.g. \"the FBI\".",
        "They found that existential NPs account for 63% of all definite NPs and 76% of them could be identified by syntactic or lexical means.",
        "Cherry and Bergsma (2005) extended the work of Lappin and Leass (1994) for large-scale anaphoricity determination by additionally detecting pleonastic it.",
        "Bergsma et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a distributional method in detecting non-anaphoric pronouns.",
        "They first extracted the surrounding context of the pronoun and gathered the distribution of words that occurred within the context from a large corpus, and then identified the pronoun either anaphoric or non-anaphoric based on the word distribution.",
        "Among the learning-based methods, Evans (2001) automatically identified the non-anaphoricity of pronoun it using various kinds of lexical and syntactic features.",
        "Ng and Cardie (2002a) employed various domain-independent features in identifying anaphoric NPs.",
        "They trained an anaphoricity classifier to determine whether a NP was anaphoric or not, and employed an independently-trained coreference resolution system to only resolve those mentions which were classified as anaphoric.",
        "Experiments showed that their method improved the performance of coreference resolution by 2.0 and 2.6 to 65.8 and 64.2 in F1-measure on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 corpora, respectively.",
        "Ng (2004) examined the representation and optimization issues in computing and using anaphoricity information to improve learning-based coreference resolution.",
        "On the basis, he presented a corpus-based approach (Ng, 2009) for achieving global optimization by representing anaphoricity as a feature in coreference resolution.",
        "Experiments on the ACE 2003 corpus showed that their method improved the overall performance by 2.8, 2.2 and 4.5 to 54.5, 64.0 and 60.8 in F1-measure on the NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively.",
        "However, he did not look into the contribution of anaphoricity determination on coreference resolution of different NP types.",
        "Yang et al.",
        "(2005) made use of non-anaphors to create a special class of training instances in the twin-candidate model (Yang et al.",
        "2003) and improved the performance by 2.9 and 1.6 to 67.3 and 67.2 in F1-measure on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 corpora, respectively.",
        "However, their experiments show that eliminating non-anaphors using an anaphoricity determination module in advance harms the performance.",
        "Denis and Balbridge (2007) employed an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for coreference resolution which modeled anaphoricity and corefer-ence as a joint task, such that each local model informed the other for the final assignments.",
        "Experiments on the ACE 2003 corpus showed that this joint anaphoricity-coreference ILP formulation improved the F1-measure by 3.7-5.3 on various domains.",
        "However, their experiments assume true ACE mentions (i.e. all the ACE mentions are already known from the annotated corpus).",
        "Therefore, the actual effect of this joint anaphoricity-coreference ILP formulation on fully automatic coreference resolution is still unclear.",
        "Luo (2007) proposed a twin-model for coreference resolution: a link component, which models the coreferential relationship between an anaphor and a candidate antecedent, and a creation component, which models the possibility that a NP was not coreferential with any candidate antecedent.",
        "This method combined the probabilities returned by the creation component (an ana-phoricity model) with the link component (a coreference model) to score a coreference partition, such that a partition was penalized whenever an anaphoric mention was resolved.",
        "Finkel and Manning (2008) showed that transitivity constraints could be incorporated into an ILP-based coreference resolution system and much improved the performance.",
        "Zhou and Kong (2009) employed a global learning method in determining the anaphoricity of NPs via a label propagation algorithm to improve learning-based coreference resolution.",
        "Experiments on the ACE 2003 corpus demonstrated that this method was very effective.",
        "It could improve the F1-measure by 2.4, 3.1 and 4.1 on the NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively.",
        "Ng (2009) presented a novel approach to the task of anaphoricity determination based on graph minimum cuts and demonstrated the effectiveness in improving a learning-based coreference resolution system.",
        "In summary, although anaphoricity determination plays an important role in coreference resolution and achieves certain success in improving the overall performance of coreference resolution, its contribution is still far from expectation.",
        "For a tree kernel-based method, one key problem is how to represent and capture the structured syntactic information.",
        "During recent years, various tree kernels, such as the convolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), the shallow parse tree kernel (Zelenko et al. 2003) and the dependency tree kernel (Culota and Sorensen, 2004), have been proposed in the literature.",
        "Among these tree kernels, the convolution tree kernel represents the state-of-the art and has been successfully applied by Collins and Duffy (2002) on syntactic parsing, Zhang et al.",
        "(2006) on semantic relation extraction and Yang et al.",
        "(2006) on pronoun resolution.",

        "Experiments showed that their method achieved certain success on the ACE 2003 corpus and the simple-expansion scheme performs best.",
        "However, among the three explored schemes, there exists no obvious overwhelming one, which can well cover structured syntactic information.",
