        "With the increasing popularity of supervised machine learning methods in language processing, the need for high-quality labeled text becomes imminent.",
        "On the one hand, the amount of readily available texts is huge, while on the other hand the labeling and creation of corpora based on such texts is tedious, error prone and expensive.",
        "Active learning (AL) is one way of approaching the challenge of classifier creation and data annotation.",
        "Examples of AL used in language engineering include named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007), text categorization (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Hoi et al., 2006), part-of-speech tagging (Ringger et al., 2007), and parsing (Thompson et al., 1999; Becker and Osborne, 2005).",
        "AL is a supervised machine learning technique in which the learner is in control of the data used for learning - the control is used to query an oracle, typically a human, for the correct label of the unlabeled training instances for which the classifier learned so far makes unreliable predictions.",
        "The AL process takes as input a set of labeled instances and a larger set of unlabeled instances, and produces a classifier and a relatively small set of newly labeled data.",
        "The overall goal is to obtain as good a classifier as possible, without having to mark-up and supply the learner with more than necessary data.",
        "The learning process aims at keeping the human annotation effort to a minimum, only asking for advice where the training utility of the result of such a query is high.",
        "The approaches taken to AL in this paper are based on committees of classifiers with access to pools of data.",
        "Figure 1 outlines a prototypical committee-based AL loop.",
        "In this paper we focus on the question when AL-driven annotation should be stopped (Item 7 in Figure 1).",
        "Usually, the progress of AL is illustrated by means of a learning curve which depicts how the classifier's performance changes as a result of increasingly more labeled training data being available.",
        "A learning curve might be used to address the issue of knowing when to stop the learning process - once the curve has leveled out, that is, when additional training data does not contribute (much) to increase the performance of the classifier, the AL process may be terminated.",
        "While in a random selection scenario, classifier performance can be estimated by cross-validation on the labeled data, AL requires a held-out annotated reference corpus.",
        "In AL, the performance of the classifier cannot be reliably estimated using the data labeled in the process since sampling strategies for estimating performance assume independently and identically distributed examples (Schütze et al., 2006).",

        "In practice, however, an annotated reference corpus is rarely available and its creation would be inconsistent with the goal of creating a classifier with as little human effort as possible.",
        "Thus, other ways of deciding when to stop AL are needed.",
        "In this paper, we propose an intrinsic stopping-criterion for committee-based AL of named entity recognizers.",
        "It is intrinsic in that it relies on the characteristics of the data and the base learner rather than on external parameters, i.e., the stopping criterion does not require any predefined thresholds.",

        "What is the ideal stopping point for AL?",
        "Obviously, annotation should be stopped at the latest when the best classifier for a scenario is yielded.",
        "However, depending on the scenario at hand, the \"best\" classifier could have different interpretations.",
        "In many papers on AL and stopping criteria, the best (or optimal) classifier is the one that yields the highest performance on a test set.",
        "It is assumed that AL-based annotation should be stopped as soon as this performance is reached.",
        "This could be generalized as stopping criteria based on maximal classifier performance.",
        "In practice, the trade-off between annotation effort and classifier performance is related to the achievable performance given the learner configuration and data under scrutiny: For instance, would we investmany hours of additional annotation effort just to possibly increase the classifier performance by a fraction of a percent?",
        "In this context, a stopping criterion may be based on classifier performance convergence, and consequently, we can define the best possible classifier to be one which cannot learn more from the remaining pool of data.",
        "The intrinsic stopping criterion (ISC) we propose here focuses on the latter aspect of the ideal stopping point described above - exhaustiveness of the AL pool.",
        "We suggest to stop the annotation process of the data from a given pool when the base learner cannot learn (much) more from it.",
        "The definition of our intrinsic stopping criterion for committee-based AL builds on the notions of Selection Agreement (Tomanek et al., 2007), and Validation Set Agreement (Tomanek and Hahn, 2008).",
        "The Selection Agreement (SA) is the agreement among the members of a decision committee regarding the classification of the most informative instance selected from the pool of unlabeled data in each AL round.",
        "The intuition underlying the SA is that the committee will agree more on the hard instances selected from the remaining set of unlabeled data as the AL process proceeds.",
        "When the members of the committee are in complete agreement, AL should be aborted since it no longer contributes to the overall learning process - in this case, AL is but a computationally expensive counterpart of random sampling.",
        "However, as pointed out by Tomanek et al.",
        "(2007), the SA hardly ever signals complete agreement and can thus not be used as the sole indicator of AL having reached the point at which it should be aborted.",
        "The Validation Set Agreement (VSA) is the agreement among the members of the decision committee concerning the classification of a held-out, unan-notated data set (the validation set).",
        "The validation set stays the same throughout the entire AL process.",
        "Thus, the VSA is mainly affected by the performance of the committee, which in turn, is grounded in the information contained in the most informative instances in the pool of unlabeled data.",
        "Tomanek and colleagues argue that the VSA is thus a good approximation of the (progression of the) learning curve and can be employed as decision support for knowing when to stop annotating - from the slope of the VSA curve one can read whether further annotation will result in increased classifier performance.",
        "We combine the SA and the VSA into a single stopping criterion by relating the agreement of the committee on a held-out validation set with that on the (remaining) pool of unlabeled data.",
        "If the SA is larger than the VSA, it is a signal that the decision committee is more in agreement concerning the most informative instances in the (diminishing) un-labeled pool than it is concerning the validation set.",
        "This, in turn, implies that the committee would learn more from a random sample from the validation set (or from a data source exhibiting the same distribution of instances), than it would from the unlabeled data pool.",
        "Based on this argument, a stopping criterion for committee-based AL can be formulated as:",
        "Active learning may be terminated when the Selection Agreement is larger than, or equal to, the Validation Set Agreement.",
        "In relation to the stopping criterion based solely on SA proposed by Tomanek et al.",
        "(2007), the above defined criterion comes into effect earlier in the AL process.",
        "Furthermore, while it was claimed in (Tomanek and Hahn, 2008) that one can observe the classifier convergence from the VSA curve (as it approximated the progression of the learning curve), that requires a threshold to be specified for the actual stopping point.",

        "Zhu and colleagues (Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Zhu et al., 2008a; Zhu et al., 2008b) introduce max-confidence, min-error, minimum expected error strategy, overall-uncertainty, and classification-change as means to terminate AL.",

        "They also show that while their method lends itself to acceptable estimates of accuracy, it is much harder to estimate the recall of the classifier.",
        "Thus, the stopping criteria based on minimal absolute or maximum possible performance are not reliable.",

        "Tomanek and Hahn (2008) conclude that monitoring the progress of AL should be based on a separate validation set instead of the data directly affected by the learning process - thus, VSA is preferred over SA.",
        "Further, they find that the VSA curve approximates the progression of the learning curve and thus classifier performance convergence could be estimated.",
        "However, to actually find where to stop the annotation, a threshold needs to be set.",

        "The ISC does not require the user to set any external parameters prior to initiating the AL process.",

        "where k is the number of members in the committee, and V(l, e) is the number of members assigning label l to instance e. If an instance obtains a low Vote Entropy value, it means that the committee members are in high agreement concerning its classification, and thus also that it is less a informative one.",

        "To follow this idea, we select sentences that are assumed to be useful for classifier training.",

        "For both MEs and CRFs the same features were employed which comprised orthographical (based mainly on regular expressions), lexical and morphological (suffixed/prefixed, word itself), syntactic (POS tags), as well as contextual (features of neighboring tokens) ones.",

        "We have argued that one interpretation of the ISC is that it constitutes the point where the informativeness on the remaining part of the AL pool is lower than the informativeness on a different and independent data set with the same distribution.",
        "In the first AL scenario where there is one static pool to select from, reaching this point can be interpreted as an overall stopping point for annotation.",
        "Here, the ISC represents a trade-off between the amount of data annotated and the classifier performance obtained such that the resulting classifier is nearly optimal with respect to the data at hand.",
        "In the second, stream-based AL scenario where several smaller partitions are consecutively made available to the learner, the ISC serves as an indicator that the annotation of one batch should be terminated, and that the mark-up should proceed with the next batch.",
        "The ISC constitutes an intrinsic way of determining when to stop the learning process.",
        "It does not require any external parameters such as predefined thresholds to be set, and it depends only on the characteristics of the data and base learner at hand.",
        "The ISC can be utilized to relate the performance of the classifier to the performance that is possible to obtain by the data and learner at hand.",
        "The ISC can not be used to estimate the performance of the classifier.",
        "Consequently, it can not be used to relate the classifier's performance to an externally set level, such as a particular F-score provided by the user.",
        "In this sense, the ISC may serve as a complement to stopping criteria requiring the classifier to achieve absolute performance measures before the learning process is aborted, for instance the max-confidence proposed by Zhu and Hovy (2007), and the minimal absolute performance introduced by Laws and Schütze (2008)."

        "We have defined and empirically tested an intrinsic stopping criterion (ISC) for committee-based AL.",
        "The results of our experiments in two named entity recognition scenarios show that the stopping criterion is indeed a viable one, which represents a fair trade-off between data use and classifier performance.",
        "In a setting in which the unlabeled pool of data used for learning is static, terminating the learning process by means of the ISC results in a nearly optimal classifier.",
        "The ISC can also be used for deciding when the pool of unlabeled data needs to be refreshed.",
        "We have focused on challenging the ISC with respect to named entity recognition, approached in two very different settings; future work includes experiments using the ISC for other tasks.",
        "We believe that the ISC is likely to work in AL-based approaches to, e.g., part-of-speech tagging, and chunking as well.",
        "It should be kept in mind that while the types of experiments conducted here concern the same task, the ways they are realized differ in many respects: the ways the decision committees are formed, the data sets used, the representation of instances, the relation between the sample size and the instance size, as well as the preprocessing tools used.",
        "Despite these differences, which outnumbers the similarities, the ISC proves a viable stopping criterion.",
        "An assumption underlying the ISC is that the initial distribution of instances in the pool of unlabeled data used for learning, and the distribution of instances in the validation set are the same (or at least very similar).",
        "Future work also includes investigations of automatic ways to ensure that this assumption is met."
