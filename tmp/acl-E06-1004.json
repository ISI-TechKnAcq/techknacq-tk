        "Statistical Machine Translation is a data driven machine translation technique which uses probabilistic models of natural language for automatic translation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).",
        "The parameters of the models are estimated by iterative maximum-likelihood training on a large parallel corpus of natural language texts using the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "The models are then used to decode, i.e. translate texts from the source language to the target language 1 (Tillman, 2001), (Wang, 1997), (Ger-mann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004).",
        "The models are independent of the language pair and therefore, can be used to build a translation system for any language pair as long as a parallel corpus of texts is available for training.",
        "Increasingly, parallel corpora are becoming available for many language pairs and SMT systems have been built for French-English, German-English, Arabic-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English and other language pairs (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999), (Udupa, 2004).",
        "In SMT, every English sentence e is considered as a translation of a given French sentence f with probability Pr (f |e).",
        "Therefore, the problem of translating f can be viewed as a problem of finding the most probable translation of f:",
        "The probability distributions Pr(f |e) and Pr(e) are known as translation model and language model respectively.",
        "In the classic work on SMT, Brown and his colleagues at IBM introduced the notion of alignment between a sentence f and its translation e and used it in the development of translation models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "An alignment between f = f1 ... fm and e = e1 ... el is a many-to-one mapping a : {1, ... , m} → {0, ... , l}.",
        "Thus, an alignment a between f and e associates the french word fj to the English word eaj 2.",
        "The number of words of f mapped to ei by a is called the fertility of ei and is denoted by φi.",
        "Since Pr(f |e) = Ea Pr(f, a|e), equation 1 can",
        "be rewritten as follows:",
        "Brown and his colleagues developed a series of 5 translation models which have become to be known in the field of machine translation as IBM models.",
        "For a detailed introduction to IBM translation models, please see (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In practice, models 3-5 are known to give good results and models 1-2 are used to seed the EM iterations of the higher models.",
        "IBM model 3 is the prototypical translation model and it models Pr(f, a|e) as follows:",
        "Here, n(φ|e) is the fertility model, t(f |e) is the lexicon model and d(j |i, m, l) is the distortion model.",
        "The computational tasks involving IBM Models are the following:",
        "• Viterbi Alignment",
        "Given the model parameters and a sentence pair (f, e), determine the most probable alignment between f and e.",
        "• Expectation Evaluation",
        "This forms the core of model training via the EM algorithm.",
        "Please see Section 2.3 for a description of the computational task involved in the EM iterations.",
        "• Conditional Probability",
        "Given the model parameters and a sentence pair (f, e), compute P(f |e).",
        "• Exact Decoding",
        "Given the model parameters and a sentence f, determine the most probable translation of f.",
        "• Relaxed Decoding",
        "Given the model parameters and a sentence f, determine the most probable translation and alignment pair for f.",
        "Viterbi Alignment computation finds applications not only in SMT but also in other areas of Natural Language Processing (Wang, 1998), (Marcu, 2002).",
        "Expectation Evaluation is the soul of parameter estimation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).",
        "Conditional Probability computation is important in experimentally studying the concentration of the probability mass around the Viterbi alignment, i.e. in determining the goodness of the Viterbi alignment in comparison to the rest of the alignments.",
        "Decoding is an integral component of all SMT systems (Wang, 1997), (Tillman, 2000), (Och et al., 2001), (Ger-mann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004).",
        "Exact Decoding is the original decoding problem as defined in (Brown et al., 1993) and Relaxed Decoding is the relaxation of the decoding problem typically used in practice.",
        "While several heuristics have been developed by practitioners of SMT for the computational tasks involving IBM models, not much is known about the computational complexity of these tasks.",
        "In their seminal paper on SMT, Brown and his colleagues highlighted the problems we face as we go from IBM Models 1-2 to 3-5(Brown et al., 1993) 3: “As we progress from Model 1 to Model 5, evaluating the expectations that gives us counts becomes increasingly difficult.",
        "In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models.",
        "In practice, we are never sure that we have found the Viterbi alignment”.",
        "However, neither their work nor the subsequent research in SMT studied the computational complexity of these fundamental problems with the exception of the Decoding problem.",
        "In (Knight, 1999) it was proved that the Exact Decoding problem is NP-Hard when the language model is a bi-gram model.",
