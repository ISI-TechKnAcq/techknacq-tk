        "Successes in syntactic tasks, such as statistical parsing and fagging, have recently paved the way to statistical learning techniques for levels of semantic representation, such as recovering the logical form of a sentence for information extraction and question-answering applications (e.g. (Wong and Mooney, 2007)) or jointly learning the syntactic structure of the sentence and the propositional argument-structure of its main predicates (Musillo and Merlo, 2006; Merlo and Musillo, 2008).",
        "In this vein, the CoNLL 2008 shared task sets the challenge of learning jointly both syntactic dependencies (extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)) and semantic dependencies (extracted both from PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)",

        "Our probabilistic model is based on Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks (ISBNs), a recently proposed latent variable model for syntactic structure prediction, which has shown very good behaviour for both constituency (Titov and Henderson, 2007a) and dependency parsing (Titov and Henderson, 2007b).",
        "The ability of ISBNs to induce their features automatically enables us to extend this architecture to learning a synchronous parse of syntax and semantics without modification of the main architecture.",
        "By solving the problem with synchronous parsing, a probabilistic model is learnt which maximises the joint probability of the syntactic and semantic dependencies and thereby guarantees that the output structure is globally coherent, while at the same time building the two structures separately.",
        "This extension of the ISBN architecture is therefore applicable to other problems where two independent, but related, levels of representation are being learnt, such as statistical machine translation.",

        "Our probability model is a joint generative model of syntactic and semantic dependencies.",
        "The two dependency structures are specified as the sequence of actions for a synchronous parser, which requires each dependency structure to be projectivised separately.",
        "The derivations for syntactic dependency trees are the same as specified in (Titov and Henderson, 2007b), which are based on the shift-reduce style parser of (Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "The derivations use a stack and an input queue.",
        "There are actions for creating a leftward or rightward arc between the top of the stack and the front of the queue, for popping a word from the stack, and for shifting a word from the queue to the stack.",
        "The derivations for semantic dependency graphs use virtually the same set of actions, but impose fewer constraints on when they can be applied, due to the fact that a word in a semantic dependency graph can have more than one parent.",
        "An additional action predicates was introduced to label a predicate with sense s.",
        "Let Td be a syntactic dependency tree with derivation Dd,-D™d, and Ts be a semantic dependency graph with derivation D\\, ...,_D™S.",
        "To define derivations for the joint structure Td,Ts, we need to specify how the two derivations are synchronised, and in particular make the important choice of the granularity of the synchronisation step.",
        "Linguistic intuition would perhaps suggest that syntax and semantics are connected at the clause level - a big step size - while a fully integrated system would synchronise at each parsing decision, thereby providing the most communication between these two levels.",
        "We choose to synchronise the construction of the two structures at every word - an intermediate step size.",
        "This choice is simpler, as it is based on the natural total order of the input, and it avoids the problems of the more linguistically motivated choice, where chunks corresponding to different semantic propositions would be overlapping.",
        "We divide the two derivations into the chunks between shifting each word onto the stack, where Dd = Dbss~l = shiftt_1 and Ddd+1 = Dess+l = shiftt.",
        "Then the actions of the synchronous derivations consist of quadruples C* = (cd, switch, cs,shiftt), where switch means switching from syntactic to semantic mode.",
        "This gives us the following joint probability model, where n is the number of words in the input.",
        "The probability of each synchronous derivation chunk C* is the product of four factors, related to the syntactic level, the semantic level and the two synchronising steps.",
        "These synchronous derivations C,..., Cn only require a single input queue, since the shift operations are synchronised, but they require two separate stacks, one for the syntactic derivation and one for the semantic derivation.",
        "The probability of cd is decomposed into derivation action D% probabilities, and likewise for c*.",
        "The actions are also sometimes split into a sequence of elementary decisions D% = d\\,..., dln, as discussed in (Titov and Henderson, 2007a).",
        "These derivations can only specify projective syntactic or semantic dependency graphs.",
        "Exploratory data analysis indicates that many instances of non-projectivity in the complete graph are due to crossings of the syntactic and semantic graphs.",
        "The amount of non-projectivity of the joint syntactic-semantic graph is approximately 7.5% non-projective arcs, while summing the non-projectivity within the two separate graphs results in only roughly 3% non-projective arcs.",
        "Because our synchronous derivations use two different stacks for the syntactic and semantic dependencies, respectively, we only require each individual graph to be projective.",
        "As with many dependency parsers (Nivre et al., 2006; Titov and Henderson, 2007b), we handle non-projective (i.e. crossing) arcs by transforming them into non-crossing arcs with augmented labels.",
        "Because our syntactic derivations are equivalent to those of (Nivre et al., 2006), we use their HEAD methods to projectivise the syntactic dependencies.",
        "Although our semantic derivations use the same set of actions as the syntactic derivations, they differ in that the graph of semantic dependencies need not form a tree.",
        "The only constraints we place on the set of semantic dependencies are imposed by the use of a stack, which excludes crossing arcs.",
        "Given two crossing arcs, we try to uncross them by changing an endpoint of one of the arcs.",
        "The arc (p, a), where p is a predicate and a is an argument, is changed to (p, h), where h is the syntactic head of argument a.",
        "Its label r is then changed to r/d where d is the syntactic dependency of a on h. This transformation may need to be repeated before the arcs become uncrossed.",
        "The choice of which arc to transform is done using a greedy algorithm and a number of heuristics, without doing any global optimisation across the data.",
        "This projectivisation method is similar to the HEAD method of (Nivre et al., 2006), but has two interesting new characteristics.",
        "First, syntactic dependencies are used to projectivise the semantic dependencies.",
        "Because the graph of semantic roles is disconnected, moving across semantic arcs is often not possible.",
        "This would cause a large number of roles to be moved to ROOT.",
        "Second, our method changes the semantic argument of a given predicate, whereas syntactic dependency projectivisation changes the head of a given dependent.",
        "This difference is motivated by a predicate-centred view of semantic dependencies, as it avoids changing a predicate to a node which is not a predicate."
