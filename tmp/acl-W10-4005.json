        "Starting from the observation that monolingual dictionaries typically include a considerable number of foreign words, the basic idea is to consider the most significant co-occurrences of a foreign word as potential translation candidates.",
        "This implies that the language of the underlying corpus must correspond to the target language, and that this corpus can be utilized for any source language for which word citations are well represented.",
        "As the use of foreign language words in texts depends on many parameters, including writer, text type, status of language and cultural background, it is interesting to compare results when varying some of these parameters.",
        "However, due to the general scarceness of foreign word citations our approach requires very large corpora.",
        "For this reason, we were only able to vary two parameters, namely language and text type.",

        "But of course there are many other aspects that are important, for example, relations between countries, cultural background, relatedness between languages, etc.",
        "As these are complex influences with intricate interactions, it is impossible to accurately anticipate the actual outcome.",
        "In other words, experimental work is needed.",
        "Let us therefore describe our approach.",
        "For identifying word translations within a corpus, we assume that the strongest association to a foreign word is likely to be its translation.",
        "This can be justified by typical usage patterns of foreign words often involving, for example, an explanation right after their first occurrence in a text.",
        "Associations between words can be computed in a straightforward manner by counting word co-occurrences followed by the application of an association measure on the cooccurrence counts.",
        "Co-occurrence counts are based on a text window comprising the 20 words on either side of a given foreign word.",
        "On the resulting counts we apply the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).",
        "As explained by Dunning, this measure has the advantage to be applicable also on low counts, which is an important characteristic in our setting where the problem of data sparseness is particularly se vere.",
        "This is also the reason why we chose window size somewhat larger than the ones used in most other studies.",
        "Despite its simplicity this procedure of computing associations to foreign words is well suited for identifying word translations.",
        "As mentioned above, we assume that the strongest association to a foreign word is its best translation.",
        "We did this for words from five languages (English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish).",
        "The results are shown in the next section.",
        "In order to be able to quantitatively evaluate the quality of our results, we counted for all source words of a language the number of times the expected target word obtained the strongest association score.",
        "Our expectations on what should count as a correct translation had been fixed before running the experiments by creating a gold standard for evaluation.",
        "We started from the list of 100 English words (nouns, adjectives and verbs) which had been introduced by Kent & Rosanoff (1910) in a psychological context.",
        "We translated these English words into each",
        "German, Italian, and Spanish.",
        "As we are at least",
        "ith these languages, and as the Kent/Rosanoff vocabulary is fairly straightforward, we did this manually.",
        "In cases where we were aware of ambiguities, we tried to come up with a translation relating to what we assumed to be the most frequent of a word's possible senses.",
        "In case of doubt we consulted a number of written bilingual dictionaries, the dict.leo.org dictionary website, and the translation services provided by Google and Yahoo.",
        "For each word, we always produced only a single translation.",
        "In an attempt to provide a common test set, the appendix shows the resulting list of word equations in full length for reference by interested researchers.",
        "It should be noted that the concept of word equations is a simplification, as it does not take into account the fact that words tend to be ambiguous, and that ambiguities typically do not match across languages.",
        "Despite these shortcomings we nevertheless use this concept.",
        "Let us give some justification.",
        "Word ambiguities are omnipresent in any language.",
        "For example, the English word palm has two meanings (tree and hand) which are usually expressed by different words in other languages.",
        "However, for our gold standard we must make a choice.",
        "We can not include two or more translations in one word equation as this would contradict the principle that all words in a word equation should share their main sense.",
        "Another problem is that, unless we work with dictionaries derived from parallel corpora, it is difficult to estimate how common a translation is.",
        "But if we included less common translations in our list, we would have to give their matches a smaller weight during evaluation.",
        "This, however, is difficult to accomplish accurately.",
        "This is why, despite their shortcomings, we use word equations in this work.",
        "Evaluation of our results involves comparing a predicted translation to the corresponding word in the gold standard.",
        "We consider the predicted translation to be correct if there is a match, otherwise we consider it as false.",
        "While in principle possible, we do not make any finer distinctions concerning the quality of a match.",
        "A problem that we face in our approach is what we call the homograph trap.",
        "What we mean by this term is that a foreign word occurring in a corpus of a particular language may also be a valid word in this language, yet possibly with a different meaning.",
        "For example, if the German word rot (meaning red) occurs in an English corpus, its occurrences can not easily be distinguished from occurrences of the English word rot, which is a verb describing the process of decay.",
        "Having dealt with this problem in Rapp & Zock (2010) we will not elaborate on it here, rather we will suggest a workaround.",
        "The idea is to look only at a very restricted vocabulary, namely the words defined in our gold standard.",
        "There we have 100 words in each of the five languages, i.e. 500 words altogether.",
        "The question is how many of these words occur more often than once.",
        "Note, however, that apart from English (which was the starting point for the gold standard), repetitions can occur not only across languages but also within a language.",
        "For example, the Spanish word sueno means both sleep and dream, which are distinct entries in the list.",
        "The following is a complete list of words showing either of these two types of repetitions, i.e. exact string matches (taking into account capitalization and accents): alto (4), bambino (2), Bible (2), bitter (2), casa (2), commando (2), corto (2), doux (2), duro (2), fruit (2), justice (2), lento (2), lion (2), long (2), luna (2), mano (2), memoria (2), mouton (2), religion (2), sacerdote (2), sueno (2), table (2), whisky (4).",
        "However, as is obvious from this list, these repetitions are due to common vocabulary of the languages, with whisky being a typical example.",
        "They are not due to incidental string identity of completely different words.",
        "So the latter is not a problem (i.e. causing the identification of wrong translations) as long as we do not go beyond the vocabulary defined in our gold standard.",
        "For this reason and because dealing with the full vocabulary of our (very large) corpora would be computationally expensive, we decided to replace in our corpora all words absent from the gold standard by a common designator for unknown words.",
        "Also, in our evaluations, for the target language vocabulary we only use the words occurring in the respective column of the gold standard.",
        "So far, we always computed translations to single source words.",
        "However, if we assume, for example, that we already have word equations for four languages, and all we want is to compute the translations into a fifth language, then we can simply extend our approach to what we call the product-of-ranks algorithm.",
        "As suggested in Rapp & Zock (2010) this can be done by looking up the ranks of each of the four given words (i.e. the words occurring in a particular word equation) within the association vector of a translation candidate, and by multiplying these ranks.",
        "So for each candidate we obtain a product of ranks.",
        "We then assume that the candidate with the smallest product will be the best translation.",
        "Let us illustrate this by an example: If the given words are the variants of the word nervous in English, French, German, and Spanish, i.e. nervous, nerveux, nervös, and nervioso, and if we want to find out their translation into Italian, we would look at the association vectors of each word in our Italian target vocabulary.",
        "The association strengths in these vectors need to be inversely sorted, and in each of them we will look up the positions of our four given words.",
        "Then for each vector we compute the product of the four ranks, and finally sort the Italian vocabulary according to these products.",
        "We would then expect that the correct Italian translation, namely nervoso, ends up in the first position, i.e. has the smallest value for its product of ranks.",
        "Note that, especially in the frequent case of zero-co-occurrences, many words may have the same association strength, and rankings within such a group of words may be arbitrary within a wide range.",
        "To avoid such arbitrariness, it is advisable to assign all words within such a group the same rank, which is chosen to be the average rank within the group.",
        "In the next section, we will show the results for this algorithm in addition to those for single source language words.",
        "As a different matter, let us mention that for our above algorithm we do not need an explicit identification of what should count as a foreign word.",
        "We only need a list of words to be translated, and a list of target language words containing the translation candidates from which to choose.",
        "Overlapping vocabulary is permitted.",
        "If the overlapping words have the same meaning in both languages, then there is no problem and the identification of the correct translation is rather trivial as co-occurrences of a word with cases, it would be helpful to be able to distinlappillg WU1U5 ilclVC UlllCiCilL lllCclil have what we previously called a homogaph trap.",
        "In such (for small vocabularies guish the occurrences of the foreign words from those of the homograph.",
        "However, this problem essentially boils down to a word sense disambiguation task (actually a hard case of it as the foreign word occurrences, and with them the respective senses, tend to be rare) which is beyond the scope of this paper."

        "Whereas Rapp & Zock (2010) dealt only with an English corpus, the current work shows that this methodology is applicable to a wide range of languages and corpora.",
        "We were able to shed some light on criteria influencing performance, such as the selection of text type and the direction of a language pair.",
        "For example, it is more promising to look at occurrences of English words in a German corpus rather than the other way around.",
        "Because of the special status of English it is also advisable to use it as a pivot wherever possible.",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, the work may have implications regarding cognitive models of second language acquisition.",
        "The reason is that it describes how to acquire the vocabulary of a new language from a mixed corpus.",
        "This is relevant as traditional foreign language teaching (involving explanations in the native tongue and vocabulary learning using bilingual word lists) can be considered as providing such a mixed corpus.",
        "Regarding future work, let us outline a plan for the construction of a universal dictionary of all languages which are well enough represented on the web.",
        "There might be some chance for it, because the algorithm can be extended to work with standard search engines and is also suitable for a bootstrapping approach.",
        "Let us start by assuming that we have a large matrix where the rows correspond to the union of the vocabularies of a considerable number of languages, and the columns correspond to these languages themselves.",
        "We presuppose no prior translation knowledge, so that the matrix is completely empty at the beginning (although prior knowledge could be useful for the iterative algorithm to converge).",
        "an application programming interface (API).",
        "Next, we retrieve as many documents as possitranslations are symmetric.",
        "This means that each translation identified can be entered at two positions in the matrix.",
        "So at the end of step 1 we have for each word the translations into a number of other languages, but this number may still be small at this stage.",
        "S TEP 2: We now look at each row of the matrix and feed the words found within the same row into the product-of-ranks algorithm.",
        "We do not have to repeat the Google search, as step 1 already provided all documents needed.",
        "Because when looking at several source words we have a better chance to find occurrences in our documents, this should give us translations for some more languages in the same row.",
        "But we also need to recompute the translations resulting from the previous step as some of them will be erroneous e.g. for reasons of data sparseness or due to the homograph trap."
