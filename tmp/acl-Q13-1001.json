        "Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for more than twenty languages and achieve accuracies of around 95% on in-domain data (Petrov et al., 2012).",
        "Thanks to their efficiency and robustness, supervised taggers are routinely employed in many natural language processing applications, such as syntactic and semantic parsing, named-entity recognition and machine translation.",
        "Unfortunately, the resources required to train supervised taggers are expensive to create and unlikely to exist for the majority of written ?Work primarily carried out while at Google Research.",
        "languages.",
        "The necessity of building NLP tools for these resource-poor languages has been part of the motivation for research on unsupervised learning of POS taggers (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we instead take a weakly supervised approach towards this problem.",
        "Recently, learning POS taggers with type-level tag dictionary constraints has gained popularity.",
        "Tag dictionaries, noisily projected via word-aligned bitext, have bridged the gap between purely unsupervised and fully supervised taggers, resulting in an average accuracy of over 83% on a benchmark of eight Indo-European languages (Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "Li et al. (2012) further improved upon this result by employing Wiktionary1 as a tag dictionary source, resulting in the hitherto best published result of almost 85% on the same setup.",
        "Although the aforementioned weakly supervised approaches have resulted in significant improvements over fully unsupervised approaches, they have not exploited the benefits of token-level cross-lingual projection methods, which are possible with word-aligned bitext between a target language of interest and a resource-rich source language, such as English.",
        "This is the setting we consider in this paper (?2).",
        "While prior work has successfully considered both token-and type-level projection across word-aligned bitext for estimating the model parameters of generative tagging models (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Xi and Hwa, 2005, inter alia), a key observation underlying the present work is that token-and type-level information offer different and complementary signals.",
        "On the one hand, high confidence token-level projections offer precise constraints on a tag in a particular context.",
        "On the other hand, manually cre",
        "ated type-level dictionaries can have broad coverage and do not suffer from word-alignment errors; they can therefore be used to filter systematic as well as random noise in token-level projections.",
        "In order to reap these potential benefits, we propose a partially observed conditional random field (CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001) that couples token and type constraints in order to guide learning (?3).",
        "In essence, the model is given the freedom to push probability mass towards hypotheses consistent with both types of information.",
        "This approach is flexible: we can use either noisy projected or manually constructed dictionaries to generate type constraints; furthermore, we can incorporate arbitrary features over the input.",
        "In addition to standard (contextual) lexical features and transition features, we observe that adding features from a monolingual word clustering (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008) can significantly improve accuracy.",
        "While most of these features can also be used in a generative feature-based hidden Markov model (HMM) (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010), we achieve the best accuracy with a globally normalized discriminative CRF model.",
        "To evaluate our approach, we present extensive results on standard publicly available datasets for 15 languages: the eight Indo-European languages previously studied in this context by Das and Petrov (2011) and Li et al. (2012), and seven additional languages from different families, for which no comparable study exists.",
        "In ?4 we compare various features, constraints and model types.",
        "Our best model uses type constraints derived from Wiktionary, together with token constraints derived from high-confidence word alignments.",
        "When averaged across the eight languages studied by Das and Petrov (2011) and Li et al. (2012), we achieve an accuracy of 88.8%.",
        "This is a 25% relative error reduction over the previous state of the art.",
        "Averaged across all 15 languages, our model obtains an accuracy of 84.5% compared to 78.5% obtained by a strong generative baseline.",
        "Finally, we provide an in depth analysis of the relative contributions of the two types of constraints in ?5."
