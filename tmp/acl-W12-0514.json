        "Prepositions are hard to translate.",
        "Prepositional phrases modify both nouns and verbs (and, in some languages, other parts of speech); we only focus on verbs in this work.",
        "When a prepositional phrase modifies a verb, it can function as a complement or as an adjunct of the verb.",
        "In the former case, the verb typically determines the preposition, and the choice is rather arbitrary (or idiomatic).",
        "In fact, the choice of preposition can vary among synonymous verbs even in the same language.",
        "Thus, English think takes either of or about, whereas ponder takes no preposition at all (we view direct objects as prepositional phrases with a null preposition in this work.)",
        "Hebrew hkh ?hit?",
        "takes the accusative preposition at, whereas the synonymous hrbic ?hit?",
        "takes l ?to?.",
        "Arabic tfAdY ?watch out?",
        "takes a direct object or mn ?from?, whereas A$fq ?be careful of?",
        "takes En ?on?",
        "and tHrz ?watch out?",
        "takes mn ?from?.1 In the latter case, where the prepositional phrase is an adjunct, the choice of preposition does convey some meaning, but this meaning is vague, and the choice is often determined by the noun phrase that follows the preposition (the object of the preposition).",
        "Thus, temporals such as last week, on Tuesday, or in November, loca-tives such as on the beach, at the concert, or in the classroom, and instrumentals such as with a spoon, are all translated to prepositional phrases with the same preposition, b ?in?, in Hebrew (b+s?bw?",
        "s?",
        "?br, b+ywm s?lis?i, b+nwbmbr, b+ym, b+qwncrT, b+kth, and b+kp, respectively).",
        "Clearly, then, prepositions cannot be translated literally, and the head that they modify, as well as the object of the preposition, have to be taken into account when a preposition is chosen to be generated.",
        "Standard phrase-based statistical machine translation (MT) does not always succeed in addressing this challenge, since the coherence of the output text is determined to a large extent by an n-gram language model.",
        "While such language models can succeed to discriminate in fa-vor of the correct preposition in local contexts, in long-distance dependencies they are likely to fail.",
        "We propose a method for incorporating linguistic knowledge pertaining to the distribution of prepositions that are likely to occur with verbs in a transfer-based statistical machine translation system.",
        "First, we use monolingual language resources to rank the possible prepositions that various verbs subcategorize for.",
        "Then, we use this information in an Arabic-to-Hebrew MT system.",

        "The system is developed in the framework of Stat-XFER (Lavie, 2008), which facilitates the explicit expression of synchronous (extended) context-free transfer rules.",
        "We use this facility to implement rules that verify the correct selection of prepositions by the verbs that subcategorize them.",
        "We show that this results in significant improvement in the translation quality.",

        "Section 3 introduces the Stat-XFER framework in which our method is implemented.",
        "We present the problem of translating prepositions between Hebrew and Arabic in Section 4, and discuss possible solutions in Section 5.",
        "Our proposed method consists of two parts: acquisition of verb-preposition mappings from corpora (Section 6), and incorporation of this knowledge in an actual transfer-based MT system (Section 7).",

        "Trujillo (1995) categorizes spatial prepositions according to a lexical-semantic hierarchy, and after parsing the source language sentence, uses the representation of prepositions in the transfer process, showing improvement in performance compared to other transfer-based systems.",
        "This requires resources much beyond those that are available for Arabic and Hebrew.",
        "More recent works include Gustavii (2005), who uses transformation-based learning to infer rules that can correct the choice of preposition made by a rule-based MT system.",
        "Her reported results show high accuracy on the task of correctly generating a preposition, but the overall improvement in the quality of the translation is not reported.",
        "Li et al. (2005) focus on three English prepositions (on, in and at) and use Word-Net to infer semantic properties of the immediate context of the preposition in order to correctly translate it to Chinese.",
        "Again, this requires language resources that are unavailable to us.",
        "Word-Net (and a parser) are used also by Naskar and Bandyopadhyay (2006), who work on English-to-Bengali translation.",
        "The closest work to ours is Agirre et al. (2009), who translate from Spanish to Basque in a rule-based framework.",
        "Like us, they focus on prepositional phrases that modify verbs, and include also the direct object (and the subject) in their approach.",
        "They propose three techniques for correctly translating prepositions, based on information that is automatically extracted from monolingual resources (including verb-preposition-head dependency triplets and verb subcategorization) as well as manually-crafted selection rules that rely on lexical, syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Our method is similar in principle, the main differences being: (i) we incorporate linguistic knowledge in a statistical decoder, facilitating scalability of the MT system, (ii) we use much more modest resources (in particular, we do not parse either of the two languages), and (iii) we report standard evaluation measures.",
        "Much work has been done regarding the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames in English (Brent, 1991; Manning, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen, 2002), Czech (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000), French (Chesley and Salmon-alt, 2006), and several other languages.",

        "The method we propose is implemented in the framework of Stat-XFER (Lavie, 2008), a statistical machine translation engine that includes a declarative formalism for symbolic transfer grammars.",
        "A grammar consists of a collection of synchronous context-free rules, which can be augmented by unification-style feature constraints.",
        "These transfer rules specify how phrase structures in a source-language correspond and transfer to phrase structures in a target language, and the constraints under which these rules should apply.",
        "The framework also includes a transfer engine that applies the transfer grammar to a source-language input sentence at runtime, and produces collections of scored word-and phrase-level translations according to the grammar.",
        "Scores are based on a log-linear combination of several features, and a beam-search controls the underlying parsing and transfer process.",
        "Crucially, Stat-XFER is a statistical MT framework, which uses statistical information to weigh word translations, phrase correspon",
        "dences and target-language hypotheses; in contrast to other paradigms, however, it can utilize both automatically-created and manually-crafted language resources, including dictionaries, morphological processors and transfer rules.",
        "Stat-XFER has been used as a platform for developing MT systems for Hindi-to-English (Lavie et al., 2003), Hebrew-to-English (Lavie et al., 2004), Chinese-to-English, French-to-English (Hanne-man et al., 2009) and many other low-resource language pairs, such as Inupiaq-to-English and Mapudungun-to-Spanish.",
        "In this work, we use the Arabic-to-Hebrew MT system developed by Shilon et al. (2010), which uses over 40 manually-crafted rules.",
        "Other resources include Arabic morphological analyzer and disambiguator (Habash, 2004), Hebrew morphological generator (Itai and Wintner, 2008) and a Hebrew language model compiled from available corpora (Itai and Wintner, 2008).",
        "While our proposal is cast within the framework of Stat-XFER, it can be in principle adapted to other syntax-based approaches to MT; specifically, Williams and Koehn (2011) show how to employ unification-based constraints to the target-side of a string-to-tree model, integrating constrain evaluation into the decoding process."

        "As a backoff model, one could use a bigram model of only the preposition and the head of the following noun phrase, e.g., (on, Wednesday).",
        "This may help in the case of temporal and locative adjuncts that are less related to the preceding verb.",
        "Once such data are acquired, they may be used in the process of scoring hypotheses, if a parser is incorporated in the process.",
        "One major shortcoming of this approach is the difficulty of acquiring the necessary data, and in particular the effect of data sparsity on the accuracy of this approach.",
        "In addition, a high quality parser for the target language must be available, and it must be incorporated during the decoding step, which is a heavy burden on performance.",
        "Alternatively, one could acquire lexical and semantic mappings between verbs, the type of their arguments, the selectional restrictions they impose, and the possible prepositions used to express such relations.",
        "This can be done using a mapping from surface forms to lexical ontologies, like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and to a syntactic-semantic mapping like VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) which lists the relevant preceding preposition.",
        "Similar work has been done by Shi and Mihalcea (2005) for the purpose of semantic parsing.",
        "These lexical-semantic resources can help map between the verb and its possible arguments with their thematic roles, including selectional restrictions on them (expressed lexically, using a WordNet synset, like human or concrete).",
        "The main shortcoming of this solution is that such explicit lexical and semantic resources exist mainly for English.",
        "In addition, even when translating into English, this information can only assist in limiting the number of possible prepositions but not in determining them.",
        "For example, one can talk about the event, after the event, or at the event.",
        "The information that can determine the correct preposition is in the source sentence.",
        "Finally, a potential solution is to allow translation of source-language prepositions to a limited set of possible target-language prepositions, and then use both target-language constraints on possible verb-preposition matches and an n-gram language model to choose the most adequate solution.",
        "Despite the fact that this solution does not model the probability of the target preposition given its verb and the original sentence, it limits the number of possible translations by taking into account the target-language verb and the possible constraints on the prepositions it licenses.",
        "This method is also the most adequate for a scenario that employs a statistical decoder, such as the one used in Stat-XFER.",

        "Having emphasized the challenge of (machine) translation of prepositions, specifically between Hebrew and Arabic, we discussed several solutions and proposed a preferred method.",
        "We extract linguistic information regarding the correspondences between Hebrew verbs and their licensed prepositions, and use this knowledge for improving the quality of Arabic-to-Hebrew machine translation in the context of the Stat-XFER framework.",
        "We presented encouraging evaluation results showing that the use of linguistic knowledge regarding prepositions indeed significantly improves the quality of the translation.",
        "This work can be extended along various dimensions.",
        "First, we only focused on verb arguments that are prepositional phrases here.",
        "However, our Hebrew verb-subcategorization data include also information on other types of complements, such as subordinate clauses (introduced by the complementizer s?",
        "?that?)",
        "and infinitival verb phrases.",
        "We intend to extend our transfer grammar in a way that will benefit from this information in the future.",
        "Second, we currently do not use the weights associated with specific prepositions in our subcategorization database; we are looking into ways to incorporate this statistical information in the decoding phase of the translation.",
        "Furthermore, our database contains also statistics on the distribution of nouns following each preposition (which are likely to function as the heads of the object of the preposition); such information can also improve the accuracy of translation, and can be incorporated into the system.",
        "Another direction is to acquire and incorporate similar information on deverbal nouns, which license the same prepositions as the verbs they are derived from.",
        "For example, xtimh ?l hskm ?signing.noun an agreement?, where the Hebrew preposition ?l ?on?",
        "must be used, as in the corresponding verbal from xtm ?l hskm ?signed.verb an agreement?.",
        "We will address such extensions in future research."
