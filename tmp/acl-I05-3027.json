        "We present a Chinese word segmentation system submitted to the closed track of Sighan bakeoff 2005.",
        "Our segmenter was built using a conditional random field sequence model that provides a framework to use a large number of linguistic features such as character identity, morphological and character reduplication features.",
        "Because our morphological features were extracted from the training corpora automatically, our system was not biased toward any particular variety of Mandarin.",
        "Thus, our system does not overfit the variety of Mandarin most familiar to the system's designers.",
        "Our final system achieved a F-score of 0.947 (AS), 0.943 (HK), 0.950 (PK) and 0.964 (MSR)."

        "The 2005 Sighan Bakeoff included four different corpora, Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (HK), Peking University (PK), and Microsoft Research Asia (MSR), each of which has its own definition of a word.",
        "In the 2003 Sighan Bakeoff (Sproat & Emerson 2003), no single model performed well on all corpora included in the task.",
        "Rather, systems tended to do well on corpora largely drawn from a set of similar Mandarin varieties to the one they were originally developed for.",
        "Across corpora, variation is seen in both the lexicons and also in the word segmentation standards.",
        "We concluded that, for future systems, generalization across such different Mandarin varieties is crucial.",
        "To this end, we proposed a new model using character identity, morphological and character reduplication features in a conditional random field modeling framework."

        "(2004) first used this framework for Chinese word segmentation by treating it as a binary decision task, such that each character is labeled either as the beginning of a word or the continuation of one.",
        "Gaussian priors were used to prevent overfitting and a quasi-Newton method was used for parameter optimization.",
        "The probability assigned to a label sequence for a particular sequence of characters by a CRF is given by the equation below:",
        "Y is the label sequence for the sentence, X is the sequence of unsegmented characters, Z(X) is a normalization term, fk is a feature function, and c indexes into characters in the sequence being labeled.",
        "A CRF allows us to utilize a large number of n-gram features and different state sequence",

        "The linguistic features used in our model fall into three categories: character identity n-grams, morphological and character reduplication features.",
        "For each state, the character identity features (Ng & Low 2004, Xue & Shen 2003, Goh et al.",
        "2003) are represented using feature functions that key off of the identity of the character in the current, proceeding and subsequent positions.",
        "Specifically, we used four types of unigram feature functions, designated as C0 (current character), C1 (next character), C-1 (previous character), C-2 (the character two characters back).",
        "Furthermore, four types of bi-gram features were used, and are notationally designated here as conjunctions of the previously specified unigram features, C0C1, C-1C0, C-1C1, C-2C-1, and C2C0.",
        "Given that unknown words are normally more than one character long, when representing the morphological features as feature functions, such feature functions keyed off the morphological information extracted from both the proceeding state and the current state.",
        "Our morphological features are based upon the intuition regarding unknown word features given in Gao et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "Specifically, their idea was to use productive affixes and characters that only occurred independently to predict boundaries of unknown words.",
        "To construct a table containing affixes of unknown words, rather than using threshold-filtered affix tables in a separate unknown word model as was done in Gao et al.",
        "(2004), we first extracted rare words from a corpus and then collected the first and last characters to construct the prefix and suffix tables.",
        "For the table of individual character words, we collected an individual character word table for each corpus of the characters that always occurred alone as a separate word in the given corpus.",
        "We also collected a list of bi-grams from each training corpus to distinguish known strings from unknown.",
        "Adopting all the features together in a model and using the automatically generated morphological tables prevented our system from manually overfitting the Mandarin varieties we are most familiar with.",
        "The tables are used in the following ways: 1) C-1+C0 unknown word feature functions were created for each specific pair of characters in the bi-gram tables.",
        "Such feature functions are active if the characters in the respective states match the corresponding feature function’s characters.",
        "These feature functions are designed to distinguish known strings from unknown.",
        "2) C-1, C0, and C1 individual character feature functions were created for each character in the individual character word table, and are likewise active if the respective character matches the feature function’s character.",
        "3) C-1 prefix feature functions are defined over characters in the prefix table, and fire if the character in the proceeding state matches the feature function’s character.",
        "4) C0 suffix feature functions are defined over suffix table characters, and fire if the character in the current state matches the feature function’s character.",
        "Additionally, we also use reduplication feature functions that are active based on the repetition of a given character.",
        "We used two such feature functions, one that fires if the previous and the current character, C-1 and C0, are identical and one that does so if the subsequent and the previous characters, C-1 and C1, are identical.",
        "Most features appeared in the first-order templates with a few of character identity features in the both zero-order and first-order templates.",
        "We also did normalization of punctuations due to the fact that Mandarin has a huge variety of punctuations.",
        "Table 1 shows the number of data features and lambda weights in each corpus."

        "For the corpora that considered 4 character idioms as a word, our system combined most of new idioms together.",
        "This differs greatly from the results that one would likely obtain with a more traditional MaxMatch based technique, as such an algorithm would segment novel idioms.",
        "One short coming of our system is that it is not robust enough to distinguish the difference between ordinal numbers and numbers with measure nouns.",
        "For example, (3rd year) and (three years) are not distinguishable to our system.",
        "In order to avoid this problem, it might require having more syntactic knowledge than was implicitly given in the training data.",
        "Finally, some errors are due to inconsistencies in the gold segmentation of non-hanzi character.",
