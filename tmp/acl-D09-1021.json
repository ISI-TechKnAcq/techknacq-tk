        "The models we describe make use of phrasal entries augmented with subtrees that provide syntactic information in the target language.",
        "As one example, when translating the sentence wir müssen auch diese kritik ernst nehmen from German into English, the following sequence of syntactic phrasal entries might be used (we show each English syntactic fragment above its associated German sub-string):",

        "Some key aspects of our approach are as follows:",
        "• We impose no constraints on entries in the phrasal lexicon.",
        "The method thereby retains the full set of lexical entries of phrase-based systems (e.g.,(Koehn et al., 2003)).",
        "• The model allows a straightforward integration of lexicalized syntactic language models – for example the models of (Charniak, 2001) – in addition to a surface language model.",
        "• The operations used to combine tree fragments into a complete parse tree are significant generalizations of standard parsing operations found in TAG; specifically, they are modified to be highly flexible, potentially allowing any possible permutation (reordering) of the initial fragments.",
        "As one example of the type of parsing operations that we will consider, we might allow the tree fragments shown above for these criticisms and take to be combined to form a new structure with the sub-string take these criticisms.",
        "This step in the derivation is necessary to achieve the correct English word order, and is novel in a couple of respects: first, these criticisms is initially seen to the left of take, but after the adjunction this order is reversed; second, and more unusually, the treelet for seriously has been skipped over, with the result that the German words translated at this point {diese, kritik, and nehmen) form a non-contiguous sequence.",

        "For example, we might introduce features that: a) condition dependencies created in the target language on dependency relations between their aligned words in the source language; b) condition target-language dependencies on whether they are aligned to words that are in the same clause or segment in the source language string; or, c) condition the grammatical roles of nouns in the target language on grammatical roles of aligned words in the source language.",
