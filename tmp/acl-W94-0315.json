        "A natural language generation system is typically constituted by two main components: a content planning component (e.g., text planner or dialogue act planner) and a linguistic realization component.",
        "But, this is not sufficient since, on the one hand, the message built by the content planning component is generally not adequately detailed in order to control the many possibilities for its expression and, on the other hand, the content planner cannot influence the way in which the message will be verbalized.",
        "Generation systems require a third component, called the micro-planning (or sentence planning or phrasing) component, which acts as an intermediary between the pragmatico-semantic level and the purely syntactic level.",
        "The micro-planner is responsible for transforming the message into a textual structure.",
        "For this transformation to be achieved, grammatical and lexical resources must be selected."

        "Traditionally, the architecture of a generation system is either pipelined (e.g., TEXT [McKeown 85]), interleaved (e.g., PAULINE [Hovy 90]) or integrated (e.g., KAMP [Appelt 85]).",
        "Whatever the approach, the system is divided into two main components: a message planning component and a linguistic realization component.",
        "The former is responsible for the selection and organization of the information to be conveyed; it builds a structure often called message.",
        "The latter involves the formulation of the message in grammatically correct sentences.",
        "In a context of discourse, the message planning component is a text planner and the message is a text plan This work was realized at the Istituto per Is Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST) in Trento (Italy).",
        "(e.g., see [Maier & Not 93]).",
        "In a context of dialogue, the message planner is a 'fictitious' component consisting of a dialogue act planner, which precedes the generation system, and a planner for surface linguistic acts, which is a component of the generation system.",
        "The dialogue act planner builds plans of dialogue acts.",
        "A plan of dialogue acts is a treelike structure in which non-leaf nodes are.",
        "macro-acts (e.g., \"disjunction\" or \"sequence\" of dialogue acts) and leaf nodes are dialogue acts (see [Sadek 91]).",
        "A dialogue act conveys information about its type (e.g., \"inform\", \"yn-question\" or \"confirm\"), its propositional content (i.e., a semantico-conceptual representation of the information to be communicated), and the interlocutors.",
        "The surface linguistic act planner transforms a plan of dialogue acts into a plan of surface linguistic acts (i.e., the message).",
        "In particular, the dialogue act type is transformed into a surface linguistic act type such as \"assertion\", \"answer\" or \"question\", and the semantico-conceptual content into a semantic propositional content (cf. figure 1 and section 3).",
        "One of the problems which appear in traditional generation systems concerns the message itself: it is underspecified with respect to the language.",
        "On the one hand, the message planner cannot influence the way in which the message will be verbalized, and, on the other hand, the message is not detailed enough for the many possibilities for its expression to be controlled.",
        "Figure 1 shows several messages (a text plan and three surface linguistic acts corresponding to the same dialogue act) and their different verbalizations.",
        "A second problem is related to the fact that most generation systems produce texts successfully since they implicitly ensure that the messages are expressible.",
        "For instance, in the case where the message is a text plan, each atomic unit in the message must be a proposition, and thus can always be realized as a clause.",
        "Each unit can be independently translated into the language using the linguistic realization component, since there are",
        "(A3) Mary was shot by John.",
        "She was killed.",
        "(A4) John shot Mary killing her.",
        "(As) John shot Mary who was killed.",
        "Dialogue act: <S, Inform(U, tx arrival-airport (x, ty flight (y) A departure-time(y, 10:00)) = JFK)> This dialogue act can be transformed into three distinct 'assertions\" or \"answers\".",
        "• Content 1 = a destination-event whose theme is \"the 10:00 flight\" and destination is \"JFK\": (HAI) The 10:00 flight goes to JFK.",
        "(BA2) It goes to JFK.",
        "(BA3) To JFK.",

        "(BB2) The arrival airport is JFK.",
        "(BB3) JFK.",
        "• Content 3 = a destination-event whose theme is \"the hearer\" and destination is \"JFK\": (13c3) You will arrive at JFK.",
        "(Bc2) At JFK.",
        "few restrictions on how to connect clauses.",
        "In particular, clauses can be connected with coordinate or subordinate conjunctions or can be simply realized as separate sentences.",
        "However, this kind of approach does not use the full expressive power of the language in which units may be much more tightly composed.",
        "Moreover, as argued in [Hovy 92], a two-component generation system is not satisfactory in producing 'good quality' texts since too many phenomena are ignored or processed in a simplistic way, for example, anaphora planning, choice of lexical items, aggregation of clauses and noun phrases, selection of grammatical constructions (e.g., the choice of the verb voice), and segmentation into sentences (i.e., single sentence vs. separate sentences, hypotaxis vs. parataxis, and determination of clause order).",
        "The main difficulty in taking these phenomena into account is due to the fact that they are \"supra-grammatical but not really related to content selection and organization\" [Hovy 92, p. 2].",
        "In fact, Hovy argues that these phenomena should be treated after the message planning and before the linguistic realization.",
        "A third problem is related to the fact that in a two-component generation system the conceptual decisions are taken by the message planner and the the linguistic decisions by the realization component.",
        "Since conceptual and linguistic decisions are dependent on each other (see [Danlos 87]), the two components should be able to communicate with each other.",
        "On the one hand, the definition of such a communication is a complex task, due to the gap between the two activities (see [Meteer 92]).",
        "On the other hand, all the grammatical details that can be provided by a linguistic realizer may not be useful to take these decisions.",
        "We think that, in a first step, it is use",
        "ful to know that such linguistic phenomena exist in the target language without being able to realize them.",
        "For example, it is useful to know that a present participial clause can verbalize the rhetorical relation \"result\", but it is not useful to know (in a first step) that a present participial clause is formed by adding \"ing\" at the end of the stem of a verb."

        "The role of this third component, called the micro-planner in [Levelt 89], is to plan the best informational perspective that can be given to the message.",
        "The component often uses an intermediate representation level.",
        "For example, in the system Epicure [Dale 88], a recoverable semantic structure, which specifies the underlying content of the utterance to be generated, and an abstract syntactic structure, which is much closer to the surface syntax of the linguistic form which will be produced, are used.",
        "Dale also shows how the two levels of representation play a role in the generation of elisions and one-anaphoric expressions.",
        "However, the abstract syntactic level of most generation systems is often hazy and dependent on the syntactic formalism used by the linguistic realization component.",
        "Our intermediate structure, which we call textual' structure, is expressed in terms of abstract linguistic resources [Meteer 9212.",
        "These resources are abstractions over concrete resources of language (e.g., syntactic structures, words, and grammatical features); they reflect linguistic constraints while abstracting away from syntactic details.",
        "They are useful for generation systems since allowing a generation system to select the concrete resOurces... makes available many more degrees of freedom than the language actually permits [Meteer 92, p. 67].",
        "Abstract linguistic resources become the terms in which the micro-planning component takes its decisions and that way they constrain the system to only do what is expressible in the language since it is not allowed to choose them independently.",
        "We made some modifications on two kinds of abstract resources defined by Meteer: we improved her semantic categories by using perspectives from systemic functional linguistics (cf. section 2.1) and we extended the notion of resource trees (cf. section 2.2).",
        "\"Textual\" is used in the sense of the textual metafunction in the systemic functional theory (see below).",
        "For presentations of systemic functional linguistics, see [Halliday 851 or [Matthiessen Sz Bateman 91].",
        "2Meteer used the abstract linguistic resources to build a structure which she called text structure.",

        "These categories constrain the composition of the utterance by defining what kinds of constituents can be extended and how they can be composed.",
        "For example, an adjunct constituent of type manner can be added to an event (e.g., Peter suddenly decided to go to the beach) whereas an adjunct of type property cannot (e.g., *Peter importantly decided to go to the beach4); a process-event can be composed with a durative-adverbial (e.g., Karen watched TV for an hour) whereas a transition-event may be composed of a frame-adverbial (e.g., Karen solved the problem in one hour).",
        "On the one hand, we think that according to systemic linguistic theory', the hierarchy of semantic categories mikes ideational constraints and textual constraints; both are semantic, but semantic of rather different kinds.",
        "Thus, while it is correct that the categories event, manner, and property are semantic (ideational) categories, taking an event perspective on something is a textual decision.",

        "In order to solve these problems, we propose to replace the hierarchy with two constituent hierarchies: an ideational semantic hierarchy and a textual semantic hierarchy.",

        "Firstly, Meteer's semantic category hierarchy was substituted by two distinct semantic hierarchies: an ideational semantic hierarchy (i.e., the Upper Model [Bateman et al.",
        "90]) and a textual semantic hierarchy.",
        "Secondly, we increased the expressibility of the resource tree definition language.",
        "Moreover, we defined a simple mechanism to represent lexical resources of the language.",
        "In a three-component generation system, the micro-planner makes the linguistic decisions (e.g., the selection of syntactic structures and the choice of lexical items) that are usually taken by the linguistic realizer in a two-component generation system.",
        "The advantages are, firstly, taking a decision is simpler since the micro-planner deals with abstract linguistic knowledge, secondly, the micro-planner is closer to the message planner than the linguistic realizer, and, thirdly, the linguistic realization component is simplified since it no longer has to take linguistic decisions.",
        "Such a component appears in the generation system of [Danlos 87]: the strategic component takes conceptual and linguistic decisions, and the tactical component only applies grammar rules.",
