        "We probably realize that, in a randomly driven sentence, the word \"Alba\" is less anticipated than \"wedding\" or \"reports\", which adds value to the word \"Alba\" if used.",
        "Such anticipation can be modeled as a ratio between an empirical probability of the word (in a given corpus) and its estimated probability in general English.",
        "Aggregated over all words in a document, this ratio may be used as a measure of the document's topicality.",
        "Assuming that the corpus consists of on-topic and off-topic documents (we call them the core and the noise), our goal is to determine which documents belong to the core.",
        "We propose two unsupervised methods for doing this.",
        "First, we assume that words are sampled i.i.d., and propose an information-theoretic framework for determining the core.",
        "Second, we relax the independence assumption and use a simple graphical model to rank documents according to their likelihood of belonging to the core.",
        "We discuss theoretical guarantees of the proposed methods and show their usefulness for Web Mining and Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT)."

        "Many intelligent applications in the text domain aim at determining whether a document (a sentence, a snippet etc.)",
        "is on-topic or off-topic.",
        "In some applications, topics are explicitly given.",
        "In binary text classification, for example, the topic is described in terms of positively and negatively labeled documents.",
        "In information retrieval, the topic is imposed by a query.",
        "In many other applications, the topic is unspecified, however, its existence is assumed.",
        "Examples of such applications are within text summarization (extract the most topical sentences), text clustering (group documents that are close topically), novelty detection (reason whether or not test documents are on the same topic as training documents), spam filtering (reject incoming email messages that are too far topically from the content of a personal email repository), etc.",
        "Under the (standard) Bag-Of-Words (BOW) representation of a document, words are the functional units that bear the document's topic.",
        "Since some words are topical and some are not, the problem of detecting on-topic documents has a dual formulation of detecting topical words.",
        "This paper deals with the following questions: (a) Which words can be considered topical?",
        "(b) How can topical words be detected?",
        "(c) How can on-topic documents be detected given a set of topical words?",
        "The BOW formalism is usually translated into the generative modeling terms by representing documents as multinomial word distributions.",
        "For the on-topic/off-topic case, we assume that words in a document are sampled from a mixture of two multinomials: one over topical words and another one over general English (i.e. the background).",
        "Obviously enough, the support of the \"topic\" multinomial is significantly smaller than the support of the background.",
        "A document's topicality is then determined by aggregating the topicality of its words (see below for details).",
        "Note that by introducing the background distribution we refrain from explicitly modeling the class of off-topic documents – a document is supposed to be off-topic if it is \"not topical enough\".",
        "Such a formulation of topicality prescribes using the one-class modeling paradigm, as opposed to sticking to the binary case.",

        "less widely studied and therefore much more attractive from the scientific point of view, one-class models appear to be more adequate for many real-world tasks, where negative examples are not straightforwardly observable.",
        "One-class models separate the desired class of data instances (the core) from other data instances (the noise).",
        "Structure of noise is either unknown, or too complex to be explicitly modeled.",
        "One-class problems are traditionally approached using vector-space methods, where a convex decision boundary is built around the data instances of the desired class, separating it from the rest of the universe.",
        "In the text domain, however, those vector-space models are questionably applicable – unlike effective binary vector-space models.",
        "In binary models, decision boundaries are linear, whereas in (vector-space) one-class models, the boundaries are usually hyperspherical.",
        "Intuitively, since core documents tend to lie on a lower-dimensional manifold (Lebanon, 2005), inducing hyperspherical boundaries may be suboptimal as they tend to either capture just a portion of the core, or capture too much space around it (see illustration in Figure 1).",
        "Here we propose alternative ways for detecting the core, which work well in text.",
        "One-class learning problems have been studied as either outlier detection or identifying a small coherent subset.",
        "In one-class outlier detection (Tax and Duin, 2001; Scholkopf et al., 2001), the goal is to identify a few outliers from the given set of examples, where the vast majority of the examples are considered relevant.",
        "Alternatively, a complementary goal is to distill a subset of relevant examples, in the space with many outliers (Crammer and Chechik, 2004; Gupta and Ghosh, 2005; Crammer et al., 2008).",
        "Most of the one-class approaches employ geometrical concepts to capture the notion ofrelevancy (or irrelevancy) using either hyperplanes (Scholkopf et al., 2001) or hyperspheres (Tax and Duin, 2001; Crammer and Chechik, 2004; Gupta and Ghosh, 2005).",
        "In this paper we adopt the latter approach: we formulate one-class clustering in text as an optimization task of identifying the most coherent subset (the core) of k documents drawn from a given pool of n> k documents.",
        "Given a collection V of on-topic and off-topic documents, we assume that on-topic documents share a portion of their vocabulary that consists of \"relatively rare\" words, i.e. words that are used in V more often than they are used in general English.",
        "We call them topical words.",
        "For example, if some documents in V share words such as \"Bayesian\", \"classifier\", \"reinforcement\" and other machine learning terms (infrequent in general English), whereas other documents do not seem to share any subset of words (besides stopwords), then we conclude that the machine learning documents compose the core of V, while non-machine learning documents are noise.",
        "We express the level of topicality of a word w in terms of the ratio p(w) = , where p(w) is w's empirical probability (in V), and q(w) is its estimated probability in general English.",
        "We discuss an interesting characteristic of p(w): if V is large enough, then, with high probability, p(w) values are greater for topical words than for non-topical words.",
        "Therefore, p(w) can be used as a mean to measure the topicality of w.",
        "Obviously, the quality of this measure depends on the quality of estimating q(w), i.e. the general English word distribution, which is usually estimated over a large text collection.",
        "The larger the collection is, the better would be the estimation.",
        "Recently, Google has released the Web 1T dataset that provides q(w) estimated on a text collection of one trillion tokens.",
        "We use it in our experimentation.",
        "We propose two methods that use the p ratio to",

        "solve the one-class clustering problem.",
        "First, we express documents topicality in terms of aggregating their words p ratios into an information-theoretic \"topicality measure\".",
        "The core is then composed of k documents with the highest topicality measure.",
        "We show that the proposed measure is optimal for constructing the core cluster among documents of equal length.",
        "However, our method is not useful in a setup where some long documents have a topical portion: such documents should be considered on-topic, but their heavy tail of background words overcomes the topical words' influence.",
        "We generalize our method to non-equally-long documents by first extracting words that are supposed to be topical and then projecting documents over those words.",
        "Such projection preserves the optimality characteristic and results in constructing a more accurate core cluster in practice.",
        "We call such a method of choosing both topical words and core documents One-Class Co-Clustering (OCCC).",
        "It turns out that our OCCC method s performance depends heavily on choosing the number of topical words.",
        "We propose a heuristic for setting this number.",
        "As another alternative, we propose a method that does not require tuning this parameter: we use words' p ratios to initialize an EM algorithm that computes the likelihood of documents to belong to the core – we then choose k documents of maximal likelihood.",
        "We call this model the Latent Topic/Background (LTB) model.",
        "LTB outperforms OCCC in most of our test cases.",
        "Our one-class clustering models have interesting cross-links with models applied to other Information Retrieval tasks.",

        "It is hard to fit a curve that would separate between R and G\\R.",
        "We notice however, that we can \"flatten\" this graph by drawing p(w) values instead (see Figure 3 right).",

        "On the absolute scale, OCCC outperforms LTB, however LTB shows more robust behavior than OCCC.",
        "To perform a fair comparison of our results with those obtained by Bekkerman and McCal-lum (2005), we construct hybrids of their link structure (LS) analysis model with our OCCC and LTB, as follows.",
        "First, we take their LS core cluster, which consists of 360 documents.",
        "Second, we pass over all the WAD documents in the order as they were ranked by either OCCC or LTB, and enlarge the LS core with 60 most highly ranked documents that did not occur in the LS core.",
        "In either case, we end up with a hybrid core of 420 documents.",
        "Dotted lines in Figure 4 show accuracies of the resulting models.",
        "As the F-measure of the hybrid model proposed by Bekkerman and McCal-lum (2005) is 80.3%, we can see that it is significantly inferior to the results of either OCCC+LS or LTB+LS, when their parameters are set to a small value (mr < 3000 for OCCC, m < 0.06 for LTB).",
        "Such a choice of parameter values can be explained by the fact that we need only 60 documents to expand the LS core cluster to the required size k = 420.",
        "When the values of mr and ni are small, both OCCC and LTB are able to build very small and very precise core clusters, whichis exactly what we need here.",
        "The OCCC+LS hybrid is particularly successful, because it uses non-canonical words (see Table 2) to compose a clean core that almost does not overlap with the LS core.",
        "Remarkably, the OCCC+LS model obtains 86.4% accuracy with mr = 100, which is the state-of-the-art result on the WAD dataset.",

        "To answer the question how much our models are sensitive to the choice of the core size k, we computed the F-measure of both OCCC and LTB as a function of k (Figure 5).",
        "It turns out that our methods are quite robust to tuning k: choosing any value in the 300-500 range leads to good results.",
        "Real-world data rarely consists of a clean core and uniformly distributed noise.",
        "Usually, the noise has some structure, namely, it may contain coherent components.",
        "With this respect, one-class clustering can be used to detect the largest coherent component in a dataset, which is an integral part of many applications.",

        "Specifically, on weeks 2, 4, 11, and 16 the LTB models show extremely poor performance.",
        "While investigating this phenomenon, we discovered that in two of the four cases LTB was able to construct very clean core clusters, however, those clusters corresponded to the second largest topic, while we evaluate our methods on the first largest topic.",
        "Second, the (completely unsupervised) LTB model can obtain very good results on some of the data chunks.",
        "For example, on weeks 5, 8,19, 21,23,24, and 25 the LTB's accuracy is above 90%, with a striking 100% on week-23."
