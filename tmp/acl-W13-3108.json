        "These approaches were tested on the DUC 2002 data and on a submission to the MultiLing 2013 single document pilot task for all 40 languages.",
        "Automatic evaluation of these summaries with ROUGE-1 indicates that the strongest of the approaches significantly outperformed the lead baseline.",
        "The Wikipedia feature articles pose a challenge due to their variable summary size and genre.",
        "Further analysis of the results as well as human evaluation of the submitted summaries would deepen our understanding.",
        "A new nonnegative matrix factorization method, interval bounded nonnegative matrix factorization (IBNMF), was used.",
        "This method allows specifying interval bounds, which give an intuitive way to express uncertainty in the term-sentence matrix.",
        "For MDS we presented a variation of a LSA term-weighting for OCCAMS V as well as novel use of both of the IBNMF and an LDA model.",
        "Based on automatic evaluation using coverage, it appears that the LSA method and the IBNMF term-weighting give rise to competitive summaries with term coverage scores approaching that of humans for 6 of the 10 languages.",
        "The automatic evaluation of these summaries, which should soon be finished, will be illuminating.",
