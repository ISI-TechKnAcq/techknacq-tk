        "We explore efficient domain adaptation for the task of statistical machine translation based on extracting sentences from a large generaldomain parallel corpus that are most relevant to the target domain.",
        "These sentences may be selected with simple cross-entropy based methods, of which we present three.",
        "As these sentences are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain subcorpora.",
        "These subcorpora -1% the size of the original - can then used to train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform systems trained on the entire corpus.",
        "Performance is further improved when we use these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model.",

        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system performance is dependent on the quantity and quality of available training data.",
        "The conventional wisdom is that more data is better; the larger the training corpus, the more accurate the model can be.",
        "The trouble is that - except for the few all-purpose SMT systems - there is never enough training data that is directly relevant to the translation task at hand.",
        "Even if there is no formal genre for the text to be translated, any coherent translation task will have its own argot, vocabulary or stylistic preferences, such that the corpus characteristics will necessarily deviate from any all-encompassing model of language.",
        "For this reason, one would prefer to use more in-domain data for training.",
        "This would empirically provide more accurate lexical probabilities, and thus better target the task at hand.",
        "However, parallel in-domain data is usually hard to find, and so performance is assumed to be limited by the quantity of domain-specific training data used to build the model.",
        "Additional parallel data can be readily acquired, but at the cost of specificity: either the data is entirely unrelated to the task at hand, or the data is from a broad enough pool of topics and styles, such as the web, that any use this corpus may provide is due to its size, and not its relevance.",
        "The task of domain adaptation is to translate a text in a particular (target) domain for which only a small amount of training data is available, using an MT system trained on a larger set of data that is not restricted to the target domain.",
        "We call this larger set of data a general-domain corpus, in lieu of the standard yet slightly misleading out-of-domain corpus, to allow a large uncurated corpus to include some text that may be relevant to the target domain.",
        "Many existing domain adaptation methods fall into two broad categories.",
        "Adaptation can be done at the corpus level, by selecting, joining, or weighting the datasets upon which the models (and by extension, systems) are trained.",
        "It can be also achieved at the model level by combining multiple translation or language models together, often in a weighted manner.",
        "We explore both categories in this work.",
        "First, we present three methods for ranking the sentences in a general-domain corpus with respect to an in-domain corpus.",
        "A cutoff can then be applied to produce a very small-yet useful subcorpus, which in turn can be used to train a domain-adapted MT system.",
        "The first two data selection methods are applications of language-modeling techniques to MT (one for the first time).",
        "The third method is novel and explicitly takes into account the bilingual nature of the MT training corpus.",
        "We show that it is possible to use our data selection methods to subselect less than 1% (or discard 99%) of a large general training corpus and still increase translation performance by nearly 2 BLEU points.",
        "We then explore how best to use these selected subcorpora.",
        "We test their combination with the indomain set, followed by examining the subcorpora to see whether they are actually in-domain, out-of-domain, or something in between.",
        "Based on this, we compare translation model combination methods.",
        "Finally, we show that these tiny translation models for model combination can improve system performance even further over the current standard way of producing a domain-adapted MT system.",
        "The resulting process is lightweight, simple, and effective."

        "An underlying assumption in domain adaptation is that a general-domain corpus, if sufficiently broad, likely includes some sentences that could fall within the target domain and thus should be used for training.",
        "Equally, the general-domain corpus likely includes sentences that are so unlike the domain of the task that using them to train the model is probably more harmful than beneficial.",
        "One mechanism for domain adaptation is thus to select only a portion of the general-domain corpus, and use only that subset to train a complete system.",
        "The simplest instance of this problem can be found in the realm of language modeling, using perplexity-based selection methods.",
        "The sentences in the general-domain corpus are scored by their perplexity score according to an in-domain language model, and then sorted, with only the lowest ones being retained.",
        "This has been done for language modeling, including by Gao et al. (2002), and more recently by Moore and Lewis (2010).",
        "The ranking of the sentences in a general-domain corpus according to in-domain perplexity has also been applied to machine translation by both Yasuda et al. (2008), and Foster et al. (2010).",
        "We test this approach, with the difference that we simply use the source side perplexity rather than computing the geometric mean of the perplexities over both sides of the corpus.",
        "We also reduce the size of the training corpus far more aggressively than Yasuda et al's 50%.",
        "Foster et al. (2010) do not mention what percentage of the corpus they select for their IR-baseline, but they concatenate the data to their in-domain corpus and report a decrease in performance.",
        "We both keep the models separate and reduce their size.",
        "A more general method is that of (Matsoukas et al., 2009), who assign a (possibly-zero) weight to each sentence in the large corpus and modify the empirical phrase counts accordingly.",
        "Foster et al. (2010) further perform this on extracted phrase pairs, not just sentences.",
        "While this soft decision is more flexible than the binary decision that comes from including or discarding a sentence from the subcorpus, it does not reduce the size of the model and comes at the cost of computational complexity as well as the possibility of overfitting.",
        "Additionally, the most effective features of (Matsoukas et al., 2009) were found to be meta-information about the source documents, which may not be available.",
        "Another perplexity-based approach is that taken by Moore and Lewis (2010), where they use the cross-entropy difference as a ranking function rather than just cross-entropy.",
        "We apply this criterion for the first time to the task of selecting training data for machine translation systems.",
        "We furthermore extend this idea for MT-specific purposes.",
        "In addition to improving the performance of a single general model with respect to a target domain, there is significant interest in using two translation models, one trained on a larger general-domain corpus and the other on a smaller in-domain corpus, to translate in-domain text.",
        "After all, if one has access to an in-domain corpus with which to select data from a general-domain corpus, then one might as well use the in-domain data, too.",
        "The expectation is that the larger general-domain model should dominate in regions where the smaller in-domain model lacks coverage due to sparse (or non-existent) ngram counts.",
        "In practice, most practical systems also perform target-side language model adaptation (Eck et al., 2004); we eschew this in order to isolate the effects of translation model adaptation alone.",
        "Directly concatenating the phrase tables into one larger one isn't strongly motivated; identical phrase pairs within the resulting table can lead to unpredictable behavior during decoding.",
        "Nakov (2008) handled identical phrase pairs by prioritizing the source tables, however in our experience identical entries in phrase tables are not very common when comparing across domains.",
        "Foster and Kuhn (2007) interpolated the in-and general-domain phrase tables together, assigning either linear or log-linear weights to the entries in the tables before combining overlapping entries; this is now standard practice.",
        "Lastly, Koehn and Schroeder (2007) reported improvements from using multiple decoding paths (Birch et al., 2007) to pass both tables to the Moses SMT decoder (Koehn et al., 2003), instead of directly combining the phrase tables to perform domain adaptation.",
        "In this work, we directly compare the approaches of (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) and (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) on the systems generated from the methods mentioned in Section 2.1."

        "Sentence pairs from a general-domain corpus that seem similar to an in-domain corpus may not actually represent the same distribution of language, as measured by language model perplexity.",
        "Nonetheless, we have shown that relatively tiny amounts of this pseudo in-domain data can prove more useful than the entire general-domain corpus for the purposes of domain-targeted translation tasks.",
        "This paper has also explored three simple yet effective methods for extracting these pseudo indomain sentences from a general-domain corpus.",
        "A translation model trained on any of these subcorpora can be comparable - or substantially better - than a translation system trained on the entire corpus.",
        "In particular, the new bilingual Moore-Lewis method, which is specifically tailored to the machine translation scenario, is shown to be more efficient and stable for MT domain adaptation.",
        "Translation models trained on data selected in this way consistently outperformed the general-domain baseline while using as few as 35 k out of 12 million sentences.",
        "This fast and simple technique for discarding over 99% of the general-domain training corpus resulted in an increase of 1.8 BLEU points.",
        "We have also shown in passing that the linear interpolation of translation models may work less well for translation model adaptation than the multiple paths decoding technique of (Birch et al., 2007).",
        "These approaches of data selection and model combination can be stacked, resulting in a compact, two phrase-table, translation system trained on 1% ofthe available data that again outperforms a state-of-the-art translation system trained on all the data.",
        "Besides improving translation performance, this work also provides a way to mine very large corpora in a computationally-limited environment, such as on an ordinary computer or perhaps a mobile device.",
        "The maximum size of a useful general-domain corpus is now limited only by the availability of data, rather than by how large a translation model can be fit into memory at once.",
