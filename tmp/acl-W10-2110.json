        "Linguistic knowledge has traditionally been acquired by analyzing a manageable set of data, on the basis of which generalizations are posited that can then be tested on an extended set of data from the same language or comparative data from other languages.",
        "Tendencies, rather than absolute principles, are difficult to detect under this approach.",
        "This is true especially when they are obscured by counterexamples that happen to occur with high frequency, but that may be restricted to just a small minority of the overall pattern.",
        "This may prompt a researcher to discard a valid generalization from the outset.",
        "In recent years, a plethora of statistical and stochastic methods have therefore been pursued within linguistic research, leading to approaches such as stochastic Optimality Theory (Boersma and Hayes, 2001) or the use of statistics to detect crosslinguistic tendencies (Bickel, in press).",
        "However, although the various statistical methods deal with data which exhibit very complex and often ill-understood interactions, analyses have not to date availed themselves of methodology currently being developed in the field of Visual Analytics, which allows us to use our powerful visual processing ability to understand and evaluate complex data sets (Keim et al., 2008; Thomas and",

        "In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary effort whereby linguistically interesting patterns are automatically extracted, analyzed and visually presented so that an at-a-glance evaluation of linguistically significant patterns is made possible.",
        "In order to demonstrate that this technique is especially useful with phenomena that do not manifest themselves in absolute principles, but rather in statistical tendencies, we investigated a phenomenon that, on the basis of a comparatively sparse and unrepresentative data set, has recently been claimed to be a universal tendency (Pozdni-akov and Segerer, 2007): Similar Place Avoidance (SPA).",
        "In this paper, we conduct a more representative study of about 4,500 languages.",
        "Our results allow an at-a-glance evaluation which shows that SPA indeed seems to be a valid language universal tendency.",

        "It has long been noted in studies on Semitic languages, especially Arabic, that there are constraints on the structure of triliteral consonant roots (VCCC) with respect to the phonological features of the individual consonants (Greenberg, 1950).",
        "The basic observation is that consonants with a similar place of articulation are avoided in non-derived forms.",
        "A similar observation has also been made with respect to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots.",
        "Among other things, Iver-son and Salmons (1992) note that Stop-V-Stop roots were very rare in PIE, representing only 3.5% of a lexicon of more than 2,000 items.",
        "Plank (1981:221f) observes that Modern German tends to avoid verbal stems with identical consonants in initial and final positions (allowing for differences in voicing), and that those verbs with identical initial and final consonants which do exist are all morphologically regular.",
        "This indicates that they are not basic verbs, but represent a technique of word formation, perhaps derivative of reduplication as especially common in child or child-directed language.",
        "Looking at suprasegmental features, Leben (1973) argued that a similar restriction holds for the co-occurrence of tones in underlying representations.",
        "In the framework of Autosegmental Phonology this has become known as the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP), which precludes sequences of identical tones from underlying representations.",
        "This principle has since been understood more generally as a prohibition on similar items and has thus also been used in relation with the SPA bias in Semitic radicals.",
        "More recently, the application of SPA with respect to stem-internal consonants has been claimed for other non-Semitic languages as well.",
        "Pozdniakov and Segerer (2007) found impressive support for it in their sample of Atlantic and Bantu languages of Niger-Congo and further tested its crosslinguistic validity for some more languages or language groups (Mande, Kwa, Ubangi, Sara-Bongo-Bagirmi, Chadic, Malagasy, Indo-European, Nostratic, Mongolian, Basque, Quechua, Kamilaroi, Port Moresby Pidgin English) with similar results.",

        "Furthermore, stress, tone and vowel length are not recorded in the database.",
        "However, for the purpose of our investigation the transcription is suitable because place of articulation is sufficiently distinguished.",
        "We decided to experiment with two different approaches for dividing up the place of articulation features.",
        "One approach (PTCK) is based on the arrangement in Pozdniakov and Segerer (2007) and distinguishes four places of articulation for labial (P), dental (and alveolar) (T), (alveo-)palatal (C) and velar (K) consonants.",
        "A second grouping (LCD) only distinguishes three places of articulation: labial (L), coronal (C) and dorsal (D).",
        "According to this classification the consonants of all the items in the database can be assigned to one of these symbols, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Experiments with using the four-way distinction vs. the three-way distinction showed that T and C in the four-way grouping behave very similarly with respect to the transitions to other places of articulation (see Section 4.2).",
        "We therefore decided to use the three-way distinction for the bulk of our calculations and visualizations and only sporadically resort to the four-way grouping when a more fine-grained distinction is needed.",
        "Furthermore, we decided to only include those cases where the first and second consonants are preceded (or followed, respectively) by another vowel or a word boundary and are therefore not part of a consonant cluster.",
        "We mainly did this in order to minimize the noise caused by consonants of inflectional markers that tend to assimilate in such clusters.",
        "In the literature on root morphemes in Semitic, it has been noted that the consonants within trilit-eral radicals behave differently with respect to OCP.",
        "Greenberg (1950:162) remarks that while the first and second consonants are usually not identical, the same does not hold for the second and third consonants, which frequently constitute the well-known geminate subtype of Semitic verbs.",
        "However, for our work we understand OCP as it was later formulated within the framework of autosegmental phonology (Leben, 1973; McCarthy, 1986; Goldsmith, 1976) in that adjacent identical elements (here in the sense of identical with respect to place of articulation) are prohibited, under the assumption that consonants are adjacent to each other (on the C tier) even when they are separated by vowels in the linear sequence of phonemes within the word.",
        "For the purposes of our experiment, we considered the relevant context for adjacency to be one where consonants are separated by exactly one vowel.",
        "Note that since the basis for our calculations were not stems in the language but the citation forms that are used in the Swadesh lists, we also get noise from inflectional markers that are attached to these forms and might have the same place of articulation irrespective of the stem to which they attach.",
        "Finally, there are several shortcomings of the material in the database with respect to our investigation which must be kept in mind.",
        "OCP/SPA has been claimed to apply with respect to underlying or non-derived representations.",
        "Previous work has been done on the basis of stem (or root) lists.",
        "Depending on the language, Swadesh list items are not always stems, but whole words in their citation forms.",
        "For instance, while both English and German use the infinitive as the citation form for verbal stems, in English the infinitive is identical to the stem whereas in German it is marked with the suffix -en.",
        "In other languages, verbs can also be cited by inflected forms other than the infinitive (e.g., the 3rd person singular perfective in Arabic, or the first person singular indicative present in Latin).",
        "The same holds for nouns or other word classes that are included in the Swadesh list.",

        "As already hinted at in Pozdniakov and Segerer (2007), there are various other fascinating phenomena that are worth looking at, especially in regard to the interaction of vowels and consonants or vowel dependencies (such as vowel harmony) and consonant dependencies (such as SPA or consonant harmony).",
        "In particular, one could investigate why some languages apparently do not conform to SPA and if there is any covariation to be uncovered between the adherence to the principle and other factors that might be interesting to explore and possibly reveal new insights into the structure of languages."
