        "Natural languages encode spatial and temporal representations in many various ways (deictics, prepositions, verbal lexicon and preverb).",
        "This article presents analyses of the two prepositions and associated preverbs, the French sur, sur- (on) and the Polish przez, prze- (across).",
        "We are particularly interested in the way the preposition and preverb determine a place.",
        "It is interesting to note that from a diacronical view point (Bally, Meillet, Witkowska-Gutkowska) spatial prepositions become preverbs.",
        "Two problems arise : Is the meaning of the preverb composed with the meaning of lexical predicate?",
        "Does the meaning of the preverb have a prepositional origin?",
        "It is however impossible to present in this short article the results of our analysis; we show only the methods by means of two mentioned examples.",
        "We note that the work on other prepositions and preverbs in French, Polish and Spanish are in progress.",
        "Many linguists (Benett, Culioli, Pottier, Talmy ... ) have recognized the necessity of quasi-topological analysis for studying space encoded by languages.",
        "However, it seems to us that the elementary topology as defined for mathematical analysis, does not capture exactly the linguistic problems in an adequated way.",
        "For instance, the idea of boundary as expressed by languages does not always refer to a point or limit.",
        "On the other hand, the understanding of a place cannot be reduced to the spatial notion.",
        "Indeed, from the cognitive point of view, natural languages use more abstract notion while referring to the place.",
        "Thus, we represent spatial place but also temporal and notional as, for instance, in Pottier's approach (Pottier: 1992).",
        "We propose a theory of abstract places called \"Abstract Loci Theory\".",
        "This theory uses operators like in Kuratowski's algebra for elementary topology (Engelking: 1989).",
        "However, in this article, the operators of interiority, exteriority, closure and boundary are defined with new properties such that we obtain a \"quasi-topological\" structure: the interiority and exteriority operators are not idempotent and the interiority of the boundary is not always empty.",
        "We note respectively INT, EXT, FRO, FER, the new operators of interiority, exteriority, boundary and closure in this Abstract Loci Theory.",
        "We propose to give an informal approach to the main aspects of this theory as it is in progress.",
        "The notion locus refers to abstract place ( spatial or temporal or notional).",
        "Let 91 be a referential domain and let the locus LOC be a part of 91.",
        "This locus LOC builds a partition of 91 composed of three parts (see figure 1): INT (LOC): interior locus of LOC; EXT(LOC): exterior locus of LOC; FRO(LOC): boundary locus of LOC between EXT(LOC) and INT (LOC).",
        "The interior locus of LOC in Abstract Loci Theory has the following properties:",
        "The exterior locus of LOC is such that it is included in the complement of LOC.",
        "The closure locus of LOC is defined as: FER(LOC) = INT(LOC) u FRO(LOC) with the following property: FER(FER (LOC)) Q FER (LOC) Q LOC Inside FRO(LOC) we distinguish two other loci, internal boundary and external boundary, such",
        "We introduce the \"anchoring relation\" (French: repérage) between the \"anchored entity\" (repéré) and the \"anchor entity\" (repère).",
        "This relation is in general non-symmetric (Desclés, Froidevaux: 1982, Culioli: 1990).",
        "The analysis of the meaning of the preposition is done by means of Abstract Loci Theory and anchoring relation, where the preposition determines an anchor (Flageul: 1997, Desclés: 1998a).",
        "Our hypothesis is that it is possible to exhibit an invariant meaning in abductive process.",
        "We understand this invariant as cognitive representation which does not occur in natural languages (Desclés and alii: 1998).",
        "We consider the syntactical compositionality as an application of verbal prefix to verbal predicate in order to build a complex predicate (e.g. sur-applies to veiller for building a complex predicate surveiller) (Desclés: 1998a).",
        "However, on the representational level, the compositionality between the meaning of the preverb and that of the verb forms a new semantical construct; the result that cannot be described by a simple function, but is rather conceived as complex interaction between semantical units."

        "As for the Polish preposition przez and its associated preverb prze-, we managed to establish the same invariant meaning for the two linguistic units: it refers to \"crossing the boundary locus\".",

        "Our results may be compared to the analyses for the preposition przez and preverb prze- obtained in the framework of the Langacker's grammar (Dabrowska: 1996), but the latter does not use any topological approach.",
        "We claim that the invariant meaning is not universal across natural languages.",
        "Each natural language organizes its own cognitive representations (Desclés: 1998b) as it was shown, for example, by Bowerman (Bowerman: 1996), who compared different meanings of the preposition across few languages: apple in bowl, b. handle on pan, c. bandaid on leg, d. right on finger, e. fly on door.",
