        "The DLT proposal is based on the observation that domain lexica contain entries that are also part of a general lexicon.",
        "Hence, when entries of a general lexicon are marked with their associated domain attributes, this information can have two important applications.",
        "First, the DLT will serve as seeds for domain lexica.",
        "Second, the DLT offers the most reliable evidence for deciding the domain of a new text since these lexical clues belong to the general lexicon and do occur reliably in all texts.",
        "Hence general lexicon lemmas are extracted to populate domain lexica, which are situated in domain taxonomy.",
        "Based on this previous work, we show in this paper that the original DLT can be further expanded when a new language resource is introduced.",
        "We applied CiLin, a Chinese thesaurus, and added more than 1000 new entries for DLT and show with evaluation that the DLT approach is robust since the size and number of domain lexica increased effectively."

        "Domain-based language processing has an inherent research dilemma when the construction of domain lexicons is involved.",
        "The standard approach of building domain lexicon from domain corpora requires a very high threshold of existing domain resources and knowledge.",
        "Since only well-documented domains can provide enough quality corpora, it is likely these fields already have good manually constructed domain lexica.",
        "Hence this approach is can only deal with domains where only marginal benefit can be achieved, while it cannot deal with domains where it can make most contribution since there is not enough resources to work with.",
        "It was observed that the type of domain language processing that has the widest application and best potentials are cross-domain and multi-domain in nature.",
        "For instance, a typical web-search is a search for specific domain information from the www as an archive of mixed and heterogeneous domains.",
        "The contribution will be immediate and salient to be able to acquire resources and information for a new domain that is not well documented yet.",
        "A new approach towards domain language processing by constructing an infrastructure for multi-domain language processing called the Domain Lexico-Taxonomy (DLT) was proposed in Huang et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "In the DLT approach, domain lexica are semi-automatically acquired to populate domain taxonomy.",
        "This lexically populated domain taxonomy serves two purposes: as the basis of stylo-statistical prediction of the domain of a new text, and as the core seed of complete domain lexica.",
        "For the first purpose, the DLT approach relies crucially on the ability to effectively identify words that are good indicators of specific domains.",
        "For the second purpose, the DLT needs to be robust enough to allow incremental expansion when new content resources are integrated.",
        "In this study, we integrate CiLin, a Chinese thesaurus, to show that the DLT architecture is indeed robust."
