        "We propose a comprehensive theory of code-mixed discourse, encompassing equivalence-point and insertional code-switching, palindromic constructions and lexical borrowing.",
        "The starting point is a production model of code-switching accounting for empirical observations about switch-point distribution (the equivalence constraint), well-formedness of monolingual fragments, conservation of constituent structure and lack of constraint between successive switch points, without invoking any \"code-switching grammar\".",
        "Code-switched sentence production makes alternate reference to two virtual monolingual sentences, one in each language, and is based on conservative conditions on language labeling of constituents, together with a constraint against real-time \"look-ahead\" from one code-switch to the next.",
        "Selective weakening of model conditions can produce (i) the type of palindromic (or portmanteau) construction occasionally occurring e.g., in switches between prepositional and postpositional languages, (ii) the switching by \"insertion\" of very specific kinds of constituent reported e.g., for French noun phrases in switching with Arabic and, most important, (iii) lexical borrowing.",
        "Borrowing can create ambiguity as to language membership of sentence items, but the model predicts where this can be resolved, and the confirmation of these predictions, based on empirical studies of inflectional morphology, validates key aspects of the model."

        "Communities of bilinguals tend to evolve a conversational mode where elements of both languages appear in the same interaction and even in the same sentence despite the fact that all participants may be competent in either of the two languages.",
        "Whether this mode is used in preference to monolingual discourse depends on the type of interaction, the participants, the subject of conversation and many other factors.",
        "The grammatical nature of code-mixed discourse, however, tends to be very specific to the community and varies widely among bilingual communities, even among communities which share the same pair of languages.",
        "Empirical research has isolated four clearly distinct processes which may be responsible for mixing to different extents in different communities – code-switching, nonce borrowing, specialized incorporation and interference.",
        "None of these processes requires the deformation, alteration or convergence of either of the two constituent languages at the syntactic, lexical, morphological, phonological, or semantic levels at the moment the mixing occurs.",
        "Except for code-switching, however, they may all lead in the long term to lexical expansion in one or both of the languages.",
        "This paper is a contribution to a coherent formal account of code-mixing which integrates all of these processes', though only code-switching and borrowing will be considered here.",
        "This is based on a series of empirical studies which now allows us to distinguish between them structurally and quantitatively.",
        "Our starting point will be a recent formal characterization of a equivalence-point code-switching (Sankoff, 'The analysis of code-mixing is a controversial subject with respect to several aspects: Is all code-mixing – borrowing, switching, interference – really the same process?",
        "Do languages involved in code-mixing tend to converge syntactically?",
        "Are patterns of code-mixing predictable or explicable by theories of (monolingual) grammar?",
        "We assume a negative response to all these questions and refer to the literature for more detailed discussion.",
        "1998).",
        "We will then extend this to two rarer 1.2 A production approach code-switching mechanisms, and finally to lexical borrowing, the most frequent type of code-mixing.",
        "1 Code-switching 1.1 \"The facts\" The modern motivation for studying code-switching was initially to explain the observation that in bilingual communities, speakers tend to switch from one language to another in-trasententially at certain syntactic boundaries and not at others (Gumperz & Hernandez, 1969).",
        "The first general explanation to account for this distribution was Poplack's (1978, 1980) argument that switching should be favored at the kinds of syntactic boundaries which occur in both languages, thus avoiding word order that might seem unnatural according to one or both grammars: the equivalence constraint (see also Lipski, 1977; Pfaff, 1979).",
        "Despite criticism of this approach (Rivas, 1981; Wool-ford, 1983; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Pandit, 1990; Myers-Scotton, 1993; Belazi et al., 1994; Ma-hootian & Santorini, 1994), it has been successfully used to account for code-switching in Spanish-English (Poplack, 1978,1980), Finnish-English (Poplack et al., 1987b), Arabic-French (Nait M'Barek & Sankoff, 1988), Tamil-English (Sankoff et al., 1990), Fongbe-French (Meechan & Poplack, 1995), Wolof-French (Poplack & Meechan, 1995), Igbo-English (Eze, 1997) and many other bilingual communities.",
        "Other fundamental facts about code-switched sentences include the well-formedness of monolingual fragments within such sentences – true whether a fragment constitutes a complete constituent or stretches across two or more (possibly incomplete) constituents, the conservation of constituent structure, and the unpredictability of switching – even if we can determine where a code-switch can occur and where it cannot, there is no way of knowing in advance for any site whether a switch will occur there or not.",
        "In particular, if a switch occurs at some point in a sentence, this does not constrain any potential site(s) later in the sentence either to contain another switch or not to – there are no forced switches.",
        "We do not assume that the mechanisms of switching from one language to another can be deduced entirely from the general principles of monolingual grammars2.",
        "Thus we do not analyze the distribution of intrasentential switch points in terms of a grammar of any of the types ordinarily used for accounting for single languages, but by means of a left-to-right process that refers to two well-formed monolingual sentences (i.e. each satisfying the constraints of an \"ordinary\" monolingual grammar for one of the two languages) in producing monolingual sentence fragments and in evaluating potential switch points between these fragments.",
        "Our model is based on the assumption that bilinguals are fully competent in their two languages, that there is no convergence of the two monolingual codes even during bilingual discourse, and that a code-switched sentence consists of fragments of two monolingual sentences (each one a translation of the other) pieced together.",
        "This is done first through an otherwise unconstrained production model that simply copies part of one monolingual process followed by part of the other in such a way that constituent structure is conserved.",
        "The resulting process satisfies neither equivalence nor unpredictability.",
        "By adding two very simple rules for labeling some constituents according to their language, the existence of a consistent labeling – which can be easily monitored during real-time linear production – turns out to guarantee both equivalence and, for most situations, unpredictability.",
        "9 2 While formal theories of grammar may well account for monolingual language in terms of general linguistic principles, there is no reason to believe that processes which juxtapose two languages can be explained in exactly the same way.",
        "The reasons implicit or explicit in attempts to do so have to do with explanatory economy, either of individual linguistic competence or of linguistic theories.",
        "This seems specious since both are based on a notion of a \"hard-wired\" human linguistic faculty evolving in prehistoric monolingualism.",
        "Experience in widely diverse speech communities suggests instead that code-mixing strategies, including code-switching, evolve in the lifetime of particular communities, are only partly dependent on linguistic typology of the two languages and exhibit widely different patterns of adapting monolingual resources for incorporating linguistic innovation."

        "That monolingual fragments are not coextensive with entire constituents is problematic for any model relying on hierarchical relations for deciding well-formedness, since such models are designed primarily to ensure well-formedness of entire constituents, monolingual or bilingual.",
        "They cannot ensure that adjacent same-language parts of neighboring constituents are compatible (i.e. yield a well-formed fragment when juxtaposed), since these parts may not even be in the same language as the rest of the constituents that contain them (Muysken, 1995).",
        "For example, an earlier model (Sankoff Mainville, 1986), using the context-free grammars of two languages to account for code-switched sentences satisfying the equivalence constraint, could not ensure the well-formedness of monolingual fragments, for the very reason Muysken has pointed out.",
        "This problem is at the core of the conflict between hierarchical and linear modes of explanation.",
        "We will resolve it by ascribing ultimate responsibility for the well-formedness of monolingual fragments to production-level processes.",
        "These fragments, arbitrary substrings of pre-constructed well-formed monolingual sentences, are pieced together during linear production in a way which corresponds to the other general observations about code-switching and which is essentially neutral with respect to theories of monolingual grammar."

        "Linearity and hierarchy are the key structural aspects here3, and the simplest class 'In focusing on the relationship between word order and hierarchy, we are choosing a model not adapted to the treatment of tags and moveable elements such as many adverbials (whose \"switchability\" is uncontrover-of recursive grammars accommodating these properties is that of context-free grammars.",

        "Whenever a lexical slot appears in the string it can be filled with words of the appropriate category from L. When there are no more non-terminal symbols (and R must be such that this is always possible), the derivation stops, and the current string is just a sentence generated by the grammar.",
        "We will make use of phrase structure tree representation for sentences and their constituents.",
        "Each symbol appearing in the derivation is represented by a node of the tree; it dominates the constituent of which it is the highest node, and may be used to represent that constituent.",

        "Not only must each monolingual sentence be derivable in exactly one way, but each rule may contain any one symbol only once on its right hand side.",

        "By itself, however, it does not constrain how the alternating fragments in one language and the other are related; indeed it allows them to be juxtaposed in any order, as long as the fragment languages alternate; sister elements in the same constituent in a virtual sentence may find themselves remote from each other in the code-switched sentence, as with remarkable and savon in example (4).",

        "This, and other instances of forced code-switching, are clearly not phenomena observed in real bilingual discourse.",
        "Another type of construction not found in natural bilingual corpora but permitted in the simple production model might include a code-switched sentence which begins with a fragment of the virtual sentence in language A which would never occur in sentence-initial position in monolingual discourse in language A, such as se lavent in (6a).",

        "We thus come to the main point of this section: short of the equivalence constraint itself, can we motivate some constraint to account for the observation that switching occurs almost exclusively at equivalence points (notion to be formalized in Section 1.6.1) and virtually all equivalence points seem to be eligible switch points?",
        "And can this be done in such a way that during production, the model speaker avoids any switching which will obligatorily require compensatory switches later on in the sentence construction (switch planning or forcing)?",
        "Furthermore, can we do this without referring to facts of particular languages, properties of particular grammatical categories, or even the mechanisms of particular theories of monolingual grammar?",
        "Our approach to this problem is to postulate a limited degree of structural monitoring.",
        "Monitoring the monolingual fragments for well-formedness is uncontroversial, and we need not enter into the details.",
        "What we propose for monitoring at the switch points is the \"language label\" of the constituent in which the switch occurs and of its immediate subconstituents.",
        "We first ask: what parts of the constituent structure of the code-switched sentence may be with certainty ascribed to one language or the other only, and hence should be labeled accordingly?",
        "Certainly (i) all terminal symbols – lexical slots – are labeled according to whether the word filling the slot comes from LA or LB, since all words are identifiable as to their language, by definition in our model of congruent grammars.",
        "(ii) At the constituent level, any constituent, all of whose immediate subconstituents have the same label, should itself have this label.",

        "Different instantiations of this model may actually specify that certain sub constituents \"in",
        "herit\" the label – in one theory the determiner may inherit the label of the noun phrase, in another theory it may be the noun itself.",

        "To constrain the order, we are motivated to try to exclude situations such as a declarative sentence which begins with a well-formed verb phrase entirely in English followed by a subject noun phrase in another language.",
        "More generally, (iii) any sub constituent which is out of rank order position among its sister subconstituents according to one of the languages, must receive the label of the other language.",
        "For example, if the languages A and B are SVO and VSO, respectively, and the code-switched sentence has order VSO, then the labeling should be VBSBO; if the code-switched sentence were SOV, then condition (iii) could not be satisfied, since 0 is out of order according to both languages, as is the V. If conditions (i)-(iii), all of which are well-motivated, cannot be simultaneously satisfied, the code-switched sentence cannot be considered well-formed.",
        "Thus in our hypothetical example with a sentence-initial English verb phrase, requirements (ii) and (iii) conflict, so the sentence is not well-formed.",
        "And in example (7) condition (iii) cannot be satisfied with respect to any of the categories lexicalized by freres, the, savon, remarquable, wash and themselves, nor the PP node – according to the extremely constrained grammars responsible for examples (1a,b).",
        "On the other hand, each of examples (2a,b,c,d) satisfy all of the conditions (i)-(iii).",
        "All that a speaker monitors is the language label of the constituent in which a potential switch occurs and that of its subconstituents.",
        "No additional labeling is warranted within this framework, though other treatments of code-switching all have their own particular way of assigning a label to each and every constituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi, 1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton, 1993).",

        "Often, during the study of a bilingual corpus, we discover a pattern of words from a specific lexical category in language A appearing in mixed discourse in contexts where they seem to violate the equivalence constraint, but when considered as language B words, i.e. borrowings, there is no violation, e.g. kidney in (9), feeling in (15).",
