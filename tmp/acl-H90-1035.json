        "For large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition, the goal of training is to model phonemes with enough precision so that from the models one could reconstruct a sequence of acoustic parameters that accurately represents the spectral characteristics of any naturally-occurring sentence, including all coarticulation effects that arise either between phonemes in a word or across word boundaries.",
        "The aim at Dragon Systems is to collect and process enough training data to accomplish this goal for all of natural spoken English rather than for any one restricted task.",
        "The basic unit that must be trained is the \"phoneme in context\" (PIC), a sequence of three phonemes accompanied by a code for prepausal lengthening.",
        "At present, syllable and word boundaries are ignored in defining PICs.",
        "More than 16,000 training tokens, half isolated words and half short phrases, were phonemically labeled by a semi-' automatic procedure using hidden Markov models.",
        "To model a phoneme in a specific context, a weighted average is constructed from training data involving the desired context and acoustically similar contexts.",
        "For use in HMM continuous-speech recognition, each PIC is converted to a Markov model that is a concatenation of one to six node models.",
        "No phoneme, in all its contexts, requires more than 64 distinct nodes, and the total number of node models (\"phonemic segments\") required to construct all PICs is only slightly more than 2000.",
        "As a result, the entire set of PICs can be adapted to a new speaker on the basis of a couple of thousand isolated words or a few hundred sentences of connected speech.",
        "The advantage of this approach to training is that it is not task-specific.",
        "From a single training database, Dragon Systems has constructed models for use in a 30,000-word isolated-word recognizer, for connected digits, and for two different thousand-word continuous-speech tasks."

        "As new segments are created during the labeling process, occasionally the limit of 64 segments for a phoneme is reached.",

        "Because the large number of PIC models are all constructed from about 2000 phonemic segments, they adapt quickly to a new speaker.",
        "The strategy for adaptation is simply to treat each utterance as if it were new training data.",
        "By dynamic programming the utterance is segmented into PICs, which are in turn subdivided in phonemic segments.",
        "The acoustic data assigned to each segment are used to reestimate the means and variance for that segment.",
        "For the mammography task, a set of 500 sentences to be used for adaptation has been developed that includes more than 90% of the PICs used by the recognizer.",
        "Since most phonemic segments occur in many different PICs, these 500 sentences provide diverse training data for almost all segments, sufficient to provide good estimates of their parameter means and variances for a new speaker.",
        "Estimates of segment durations for each PIC are also improved as a result of adaptation, although for this purpose the 500 sentences provide much less data.",
        "To achieve real-time recognition of connected speech, a rapid-match algorithm is used to reduce the number of words for which full dynamic programming is carried out[1].",
        "This algorithm requires models which incorporate accurate duration information and which capture coarticulation effects averaged over all possible contexts for a word.",
        "The training for the rapid-match model for a word makes use of a concatenation of spectral models for the PICs of the word, with a \"generic speech\" left context used for the first phoneme and a \"generic speech\" right context used for the last phoneme of the word."

        "1.",
        "The DragonDictate isolated-word recognition system uses 25,000 word models based on PICs and phonemic segments, built from the same database of training utterances that is used for connected speech.",
        "Recognition performance for two diverse texts, a short story by Hemingway and a newspaper article on parallel processing, was 83% correct on the first 500 words.",
        "After adaptation on 1500 words, performance rose to 89% correct for the speaker who recorded the training database.",
        "For two other speakers, performance without adaptation was dismal (45% for a male speaker, 18% for a female speaker), but it rose after adaptation on 2500 words to 87% for the male speaker and 85% for the female.",
        "2.",
        "For connected digit recognition, the error rate on five-digit strings was less than half a percent for each of three different speakers after adaptation.",
        "Less than 0.2% of the training database consists of digit strings.",
        "3.",
        "For the mammography task used in testing the real-time implementation of continuous-speech recognition[2] (842 words, 1023 distinct pronunciations), recognition was tested on a set of 1000 sentences which had not been used either in selecting training utterances or in determining which PICs should be modeled.",
        "Several hundred of the PICs in this test data did not occur in any of the \"practice\" sentences that had been for training; these PICs were modeled only by generic PICs in which an average was taken over all left and right contexts.",
        "About 15% of the training database consists of short phrases extracted from the 3000 practice sentences.",
        "On this task, whose perplexity is about 66, 96.6% of words were recognized correctly.",
        "Performance was slightly better on the \"practice\" sentences that had been used to construct the set of PICs to be modeled, sentences for which no generic PICs were required.",

        "4.",
        "As a test of performance on a connected-speech task which was not so heavily used in constructing the training database, recognition was carried out on the 600 training sentences of the Resource Management task using the word-pair grammar.",
        "This task has a perplexity of about 60, comparable to that of the mammography task.",
        "PICs were built from the same training database as described above, in which about 5% of the tokens are phrases based on the resource management vocabulary.",
        "Recognition performance was 97.3% correct on a per-word basis.",
        "For this task, as for the mammography \"practice\" sentences, all PICs had been modeled, so that no generic PICs were required."
