        "ft is widely known that the word formation mechanism of compounding is highly productive, in German as well as in English, and that efficient strategies have to be developed to deal with this linguistic phenomenon in any kind of NIX system.",
        "Although this fact is generally agreed upon and a lot of linguistic research has been done, it has not been possible so far to develop a general and overall procedure to solve the problem in a satisfactory mid adequate way (cf. lA naniadou / Mc Naught 19901).",
        "Two special aspects of the problem of compounding phenomena arise, among others, within the framework of machine translation (MT), here the translation from German into English.",
        "The first problem that has to be dealt with in this case is the correct segmentation of the German compound word.",
        "The constituents having been found, the next step we have to deal with consists in translating them correctly.",
        "Correctness refers here a) to the choice of the appropriate target lexemes and I-0 to the selection of the right target construction type.",
        "Of course, there are a lot of other problems to he resolved for the treatment of compounds in MT, e.g. semantic interpretation of the relation between the constituents, the question in how far this point is relevant for translation, depth of analysis, etc.",
        "In this paper, however, we will mainly concentrate on the two problems mentioned above.",
        "An important property of our approach for segmentation (cf. 2) is optimizing tire process by using the type of the juncture between the compound constituents to formulate restrictions on their possible position (front, middle and/or end) in the compound word.",
        "Another novel characteristic of our approach is that there is no need of finding out the correct constituent structure during analysis phase.",
        "This mob-leer is transferred to the process of selecting the correct target compound construction (cf. 3.3).",
        "Tlic solutions we propose are based on an investigation of examples which were extracted, in part randomly, from real text corpora.'",
        "Contrary to the approach of example-leased machine translation (e.g. cf. (Su:mita 19911), we don't use a bilingual corpus, but a monolingual target corpus which is much easier to obtain in a very large size.",
        "The last feature a 1111c approach we would like to point out here is its multilinguality: on the our, hand, the results of German compound analysis can SerVI, as input for all target languages; and, on the other hand, the features of tire English construction types associated with the target entries for English nouns can also be wool for source languages other than German, and what is important, for Nit-applications other than MT.",
        "The several components of our model are currently being tested separately, and an integration is planned.",
        "Preliminary results indicate that the corpus based techniques achieve high accuracy, but they are, not fully analyzed yet.",
        "We plan to report complete results in a future paper."
