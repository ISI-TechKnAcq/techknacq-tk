        "Our main interest this year was on investigating an improved weight training scheme for N-best list reranking that had previously shown improvements on a smaller machine translation task.",
        "For German-to-Spanish translation we additionally investigated simplifications of German morphology, which is known to be fairly complex due to a large number of compounds and inflections.",
        "In the following sections we first describe the data, baseline system and postprocessing steps before describing boosted N-best list reranking and morphology-based preprocessing for German.",
        "We used the Europarl data as provided (version 3b, 1.25 million sentence pairs) for training the translation model for use in the shared task.",
        "The data was lowercased and tokenized with the auxiliary scripts provided, and filtered according to the ratio of the sentence lengths in order to eliminate mismatched sentence pairs.",
        "This resulted in about 965k parallel sentences for English-Spanish and 950k sentence pairs for German-Spanish.",
        "Additional preprocessing was applied to the German corpus, as described in Section 5.",

        "The system developed for this year's shared task is a state-of-the-art, two-pass phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on a log-linear translation model (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The translation models and training method follow the standard Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) setup distributed as part of the shared task.",
        "We used the training method suggested in the Moses documentation, with lexical-ized reordering (the msd-bidirectional-fe option) enabled.",
        "The system was tuned via Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) on the first 500 sentences of the devtest2 0 06 dataset.",
        "Our system used the Moses decoder to generate 2000 output hypotheses per input sentence during the first translation pass.",
        "For the second pass, the N-best lists were rescored with the additional language models described below.",
        "We re-optimized the model combination weights with a parallelized implementation of MERT over 16 model scores on the test2007 dataset.",
        "Two of these model scores for each hypothesis were from the two language models used in our second-pass system, and the rest correspond to the 14 Moses model weights (for reordering, language model, translation model, and word penalty).",
        "We built all of our language models using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-Ney discounting and interpolating all n-gram estimates of order > 1.",
        "For first-pass decoding we used a 4-gram language model trained on the Spanish side of the Europarl v3b data.",
        "The optimal n-gram order was determined by testing language models with varying orders (3 to 5) on devtest2 006; BLEU scores obtained using the various language models are shown in Table 1.",
        "The 4-gram model performed best.",
        "Two additional language models were used for second pass rescoring.",
        "First, we trained a large out-of-domain language model on Spanish newswire text obtained from the LDC, dating from 1995 to 1998.",
        "We used a perplexity-filtering method to filter out the least relevant half of the out-of-domain text, in order to significantly reduce the training time of the large language model and accelerate the rescor-ing process.",
        "This was done by computing the perplexity of an in-domain language model on each newswire sentence, and then discarding all sentences with greater than average perplexity.",
        "This reduced the size of the training set from 5.8M sentences and 166M tokens to 2.8M sentences and 82M tokens.",
        "We then further restricted the vocabulary to the union of the vocabulary lists of the Spanish sides of the de-es and en-es parallel training corpora.",
        "The remaining text was used to train the language model.",
        "The second language model used for rescoring was a 5-gram model over part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "This model was built using the Spanish side of the English-Spanish parallel training corpus.",
        "The POS tags were obtained from the corpus using Freeling v2.0 (Atserias et al., 2006).",

        "Boosted-MERT is a novel boosting algorithm that uses Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) as a weak learner to build a re-ranker that is richer than the standard log-linear models.",
        "This is motivated by the observation that log-linear models, as trained by MERT, often do not attain the oracle BLEU scores of the N-best lists in the development set.",
        "While this may be due to a local optimum in MERT, we hypothesize that log-linear models based on our K re-ranking features are also not sufficiently expressive.",
        "BoostedMERT is inspired by the idea of Boosting (for classification), which has been shown to achieve low training (and generalization) error due to classifier combination.",

        "In each iteration, MERT is performed to find the best ranker on weighted data.",

        "We therefore applied two operations: (a) splitting of compound words and (b) stemming.",

        "This is contrary to previous results in the Arabic-English IWSLT 2007 task, where boosted MERT gave an appreciable improvement.",

        "Table 3 demonstrates that the word alignments generated with word-stems markedly improved first-pass translation performance on the dev2 0 06 dataset.",
        "However, during the evaluation period, the worse of the two systems was accidentally used, resulting in a larger number of out-of-vocabulary words in the system output and hence a poorer score.",

        "The PER of BoostedMERT vs. MERT results is only 0.077, and manual observation indicates that the differences between the two are often single phrase differences in a sentence.",
        "We also computed the sentence-level BLEU for each ranker with respect to the true reference.",
        "This is meant to check whether BoostedMERT improved over MERT in some sentences but not others: if the improvements and degradations occur in the same proportions, a similar corpus-level BLEU may be observed.",
