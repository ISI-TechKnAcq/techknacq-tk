        "This paper addresses the issue of improving the quality of opinion mining from online contentious texts like the posts in debate sites.",
        "Mining and summarizing these new resources is crucial, especially when the opinion is related to a subject that stimulates divergent viewpoints within people (e.g. Healthcare Reform, Same-Sex Marriage).",
        "We refer to such subjects as issues of contentions.",
        "A contentious issue is ?likely to cause disagreement between people?",
        "(cf. Oxford Dictionaries).",
        "Documents such as debate sites?",
        "posts may contain multiple contrastive viewpoints regarding a particular issue of contention.",
        "Table 1 presents an example of short-text documents expressing divergent opinions where each is exclusively supporting or opposing a healthcare legislation 1 .",
        "1 extracted from a Gallup Inc. survey http://www.gallup.com/poll/126521/favor-oppose-obama-healthcare-plan.aspx Opinion in contentious issues is often expressed implicitly, not necessarily through the usage of usual negative or positive opinion words, like ?bad?",
        "or ?great?.",
        "This makes its extraction a challenging task.",
        "It is usually conveyed through the arguing expression justifying the endorsement of a particular point of view.",
        "The act of arguing is ?to give reasons why you think that something is right/wrong, true/not true, etc, especially to persuade people that you are right?",
        "(cf. Oxford Dic-tionaries).",
        "For example, the arguing expression ?many people do not have healthcare?, in Table 1, implicitly explains that the reform is intended to fix the problem of uninsured people, and thus, the opinion is probably on the supporting side.",
        "On the other hand, the arguing expression ?it will produce too much debt?",
        "denotes the negative consequence that may result from passing the bill, making it on the opposing side.",
        "The automatic identification and clustering of these kind of arguing expressions, according to their topics and the viewpoints they convey, is enticing for a variety of application domains.",
        "For in-stance, it can save journalists a substantial amount of work and provide them with drafting elements (viewpoints and associated arguing expressions) about controversial issues.",
        "In addition, it would enhance the output quality of the opinion summarization task in general.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 covers the details of the problem statement.",
        "Section 3 explains the key issues in the context of recent related work.",
        "Section 4 provides the technical details of our model, the Joint Topic Viewpoint model (JTV) .",
        "Section 5 describes the clustering task that might be used to obtain a feasible solution.",
        "Section 6 provides a description of the experimental set up.",
        "Section 7 assesses the adequacy and the performance of our solution.",
        "Section 8 concludes the paper.",
        "35 Support Viewpoint Oppose Viewpoint Many people do not have health care The government should not be involved Provide health care for 30 million people It will produce too much debt The government should help old people The bill would not help the people Table 1: Excerpts of support and opposition opinion to a healthcare bill in the USA.",
        "2 Problem Statement This paper examines the task of mining the topics and the viewpoints of arguing expressions towards the summarization of contentious text.",
        "An example of a human-made summary of arguing expressions (Jones, 2010) on, what is commonly known as, the Obama healthcare reform is presented in Table 2.",
        "Ultimately, the target is to automatically generate similar summaries given a corpus of contentious documents.",
        "However, this paper tackles the sub-problem of identifying recurrent words and phrases expressing arguing and cluster them according to their topics and viewpoints.",
        "This would help solve the general problem.",
        "We use Table 2's examples to define some key concepts which can help us formulate this latter.",
        "Here, the contentious issue yielding the divergent positions is the Obama healthcare.",
        "The documents are peo-ple's verbatim responses to the question ?Why do you favor or oppose a healthcare legislation similar to President Obama's ??.",
        "We define a contention question as a question that can generate expressions of two or more divergent viewpoints as a response.",
        "While the previous question explicitly asks for the reasons (?why?",
        "), we relax this constraint and consider also usual opinion questions like ?Is the passing of Obamacare bad for Americans ??",
        "or ?Do you favor or oppose Obamacare ??.",
        "A contentious document is a document that contains expressions of one or more divergent viewpoints in response to the contention question.",
        "In the context of online debate, a post usually expresses one viewpoint, although it can mention arguing used to justify a different viewpoint.",
        "Table 2 is split into two parts according to the viewpoint: supporting or opposing the healthcare bill.",
        "Each row contains one or more phrases, each expressing a reason (or an explanation), e.g. ?costs are out of control?",
        "and ?would help control costs?.",
        "Though lexically different, these phrases share a common hidden theme (or topic), e.g. insurance's cost, and implicitly convey the same hidden view-point's semantics, e.g. support the healthcare bill.",
        "Thus, we define an arguing expression as the set of reasons (words or phrases) sharing a common topic and justifying the same viewpoint regarding a contentious issue.",
        "We assume that a viewpoint (e.g. a column of Table 2) in a contentious document is a stance, in response to a contention question, which is implicitly expressed by a set of arguing expressions (e.g. rows of a column in Table 2).",
        "Thus, the arguing expressions voicing the same viewpoint differ in their topics, but agree in the stance.",
        "For example, arguing expressions represented by ?system is broken?",
        "and ?costs are out of control?",
        "discuss different topics, i.e. healthcare system and insurance's cost, but both support the healthcare bill.",
        "On the other hand, arguing expressions of divergent viewpoints may have similar topic or may not.",
        "For instance, ?government should help elderly?",
        "and ?government should not be involved?",
        "share the same topic, i.e. govern-ment's role, while conveying opposed viewpoints.",
        "Our research problem and objectives in terms of the newly introduced concepts are stated as follows.",
        "Given a corpus of unlabeled contentious documents {doc 1 , doc 2 , .., doc D }, where each document doc d expresses one or more viewpoints ~v d from a set of L possible viewpoints {v 1 , v 2 , .., v L }, and each viewpoint v l can be conveyed using one or more arguing expressions ~ ?",
        "l from a set of possible arguing expressions discussing K different topics {?",
        "1l , ?",
        "2l , .., ?",
        "Kl }, the objective is to perform the following two tasks: 1. automatically extracting coherent words and phrases describing any distinct arguing expression ?",
        "kl ; 2. grouping extracted distinct arguing expressions ?",
        "kl for different topics, k = 1..K, into their corresponding viewpoint v l .",
        "This paper focuses on the first task while laying the ground for solving the second one.",
        "In carrying out the first task, we must meet the main challenge of recognizing arguing expressions having 36 Support Viewpoint Oppose Viewpoint People need health insurance/too many uninsured Will raise cost of insurance/ less affordable System is broken/needs to be fixed Does not address real problems Costs are out of control/would help control costs Need more information on how it works Moral responsibility to provide/Fair Against big government involvement (general) Would make healthcare more affordable Government should not be involved in healthcare Don't trust insurance companies Cost the government too much Table 2: Human-made summary of arguing expressions supporting and opposing Obamacare.",
        "the same topic and viewpoint but which are lexically different, e.g. ?provide health care for 30 million people ?",
        "and ?",
        "many people do not have healthcare?.",
        "For this purpose we propose a Joint Topic Viewpoint Model (JTV) to account for the dependence structure of topics and viewpoints.",
        "3 Related Work 3.1 Classifying Stances An early body of work addresses the challenge of classifying viewpoints in contentious or ideological discourses using supervised techniques (Kim and Hovy, 2007; Lin et al., 2006).",
        "Although the models give good performances, they remain data-dependent and costly to label, making the unsupervised approach more appropriate for the existing huge quantity of online data.",
        "A similar trend of studies scrutinizes the discourse aspect of a document in order to identify opposed stances (Thomas et al., 2006; Park et al., 2011).",
        "However, these methods utilize polarity lexicon to detect opinionated text and do not look for arguing expression, which is shown to be useful in recognizing opposed stances (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).",
        "Somasundaran and Wiebe (2010) classify ideological stances in online debates using a generated arguing clues from the Multi Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) opinion corpus 2 .",
        "Our problem is not to classify documents, but to recognize recurrent pattern of arguing phrases instead of arguing clues.",
        "Moreover, our approach is independent of any annotated corpora.",
        "3.2 Topic Modeling in Reviews Data Another emerging body of work applies probabilistic topic models on reviews data to extract appraisal aspects and the corresponding specific sentiment lexicon.",
        "These kinds of models are usually referred to as joint sentiment/aspect topic models (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008; 2 http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/ Zhao et al., 2010).",
        "Lin and He (2009) propose the Joint Sentiment Topic Model (JST) to model the dependency between sentiment and topics.",
        "They make the assumption that topics discussed on a review are conditioned on sentiment polarity.",
        "Re-versely, our JTV model assumes that a viewpoint endorsement (e.g., oppose reform) is conditioned on the discussed topic (e.g., government's role) and its application is different from that of JST.",
        "Most of the joint aspect sentiment topic models are either semi-supervised or weakly supervised using sentiment polarity words (Paradigm lists) to boost their efficiency.",
        "In our case, viewpoints are often expressed implicitly and finding specific arguing lexicon for different stances is a challenging task in itself.",
        "Indeed, our model is enclosed in another body of work that based on a probabilistic Topic Model framework to mine divergent viewpoints.",
        "3.3 Topic Modeling in Contentious Text A recent study by Mukherjee and Liu (2012) examines mining contention from discussion forums data where the interaction between different authors is pivotal.",
        "It attempts to jointly discover contention/agreement indicators (CA- Expressions) and topics using three different Joint Topic Expressions Models (JTE).",
        "The JTEs?",
        "output is used to discover points (topics) of contention.",
        "The model supposes that people express agreement or disagreement through CA-expressions.",
        "However, this is not often the case when people express their viewpoint via other channels than discussion forums like debate sites or editorials.",
        "Moreover, agreement or disagreement may also be conveyed implicitly through arguing expressions rejecting or supporting another opinion.",
        "JTEs do not model viewpoints and use the supervised Maximum Entropy model to detect CA-expressions.",

        "Scored sentences are used in a modified Random Walk algorithm to generate the summary.",
        "The assumption of TAM is that any word in the document can exclusively belong to a topic (e.g., government), a viewpoint (e.g., good), both (e.g., involvement) or neither (e.g., think).",
        "How-ever, according to TAM's generative model, an author would choose his viewpoint and the topic to talk about independently.",
        "Our JTV encodes the dependency between topics and viewpoints.",
        "4 Joint Topic Viewpoint Model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is one of the most popular topic models used to mine large text data sets.",
        "It models a document as a mixture of topics where each topic is a distribution over words.",
        "However, it fails to model more complex structures of texts like contention where viewpoints are hidden.",
        "We augment LDA to model a contentious document as a pair of dependent mixtures: a mixture of arguing topics and a mixture of viewpoints for each topic.",
        "The assumption is that a document discusses the topics in proportions, (e.g. 80% gov-ernment's role, 20% insurance's cost).",
        "Moreover, as explained in Section 2, each one of these topics can be shared by divergent arguing expressions conveying different viewpoints.",
        "We suppose that for each discussed topic in the document, the viewpoints are expressed in proportions.",
        "For in-stance, 70% of the document's text discussing the government's role expresses an opposing viewpoint to the reform while 30% of it conveys a supporting viewpoint.",
        "Thus, each term in a document is assigned a pair topic-viewpoint label (e.g. 3 http://dbp.idebate.org Figure 1: The JTV's graphical model (plate nota-tion) ?government's role-oppose reform?).",
        "A term is a word or a phrase i.e. n-grams (n>1).",
        "For each topic-viewpoint pair, the model generates a topic-viewpoint probability distribution over terms.",
        "This topic-viewpoint distribution would corresponds to what we define as an arguing expression in Section 2, i.e. a set of terms sharing a common topic and justifying the same viewpoint regarding a contentious issue.",
        "The Joint Topic Viewpoint (JTV), is similar to the Joint Sentiment Topic model (JST) (Lin and He, 2009), as it models documents as two dependent mixtures.",
        "However, here we condition viewpoints on topics instead of conditioning topics on sentiment.",
        "Moreover, the application is different from that of JST which intend to model reviews data.",
        "Formally, assume that a corpus contains D documents d 1..D , where each document is a term's vector ~w d of size N d ; each term w dn in a document belongs to the corpus vocabulary of distinct terms of size V .",

        "For instance, taking a closer look to the original data suggests that Topic3-view5 (Table 4) criticizes the healthcare system and compares it to the other countries (e.g. a sample from the original documents:?revise our healthcare system with the most efficient systems in the world?).",
        "On the other side, Topic 3-view 6 explains the negative consequence of obamacare on middle class, e.g. ?ObamaCare was supposed to help the poor and the middle class.",

        "This may be related to the nature of the contention.",

        "Similarly, Topic 2 is about ?people who are gay?.",
        "The terms in view 3 (not illegal) may advocate that religious arguments from opposing stance do not make sense and that gay people are free and have the same rights as other people.",
        "Moreover, the government should not interfere in this matter.",
        "View 4 (illegal) suggests that gay people can not have children which raises the problem of population decrease.",
