        "One of the important factors that have contributed to the steady progress of the Strategic Computing Speech program has been the establishment of standardized performance evaluation procedures [1].",
        "With the use of common databases and metrics, we have been able to objectively assess the relative merits of different approaches and systems.",
        "These practices have also had a positive influence on the natural language community in that databases and rigorous evaluation procedures for natural language systems are beginning to emerge.",
        "As we move towards combining speech recognition and natural language technology to achieve speech understanding, it is essential that the issue of performance evaluation again be addressed early on, so that progress can be monitored and documented.",
        "Since the Spoken Language Systems program is in its infancy, we do not as yet have a clear idea of how spoken langauge systems should be evaluated.",
        "Naturally, we should be able to benefit from hands-on experience with applying some candidate performance measures to working systems.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to document our experience with the preliminary evaluation of the VOYAGER system currently under development at MIT, so that we may contribute to the evolutionary process of defining the appropriate evaluation measures.",
        "VOYAGER is a speech understanding system that can provide information and navigational assistance for a geographical area within the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
        "The components of the system are described in a companion paper [2].",
        "To evaluate VOYAGER we made use of a spontaneous speech database that we have recently collected consisting of nearly 10,000 sentences from 100 speakers.",
        "The database is described in another companion paper [3]."

      "heading": "EVALUATION ISSUES",
      "text": [
        "We believe that spoken language systems should be evaluated along several dimensions.",
        "First, the accuracy of the system and its various modules should be documented.",
        "Thus, for example, one can measure a given system's phonetic, word, and sentence accuracy, as well as linguistic and task completion accuracy.",
        "Second, one must measure the coverage and habitability of the system.",
        "This can be applied to the lexicon, the language model, and the application back-end.",
        "Third, the system's flexibility must be established.",
        "For",
        "example, how easy is it to add new knowledge to the system?",
        "How difficult is it to port the system to a different application?",
        "Finally, the efficiency of the system should be evaluated.",
        "One such measure may be the task completion time.",
        "Whether we want to evaluate the accuracy of a spoken language system in part or as a whole, we must first establish what the reference should be.",
        "For example, determining word accuracy for speech recdgnizers requires that the reference string of words first be transcribed.",
        "Similarly, assessing the appropriateness of a syntactic parse presupposes that we know what the correct parse is.",
        "In some cases, establishing the reference is relatively straightforward and can be done almost objectively.",
        "In other cases, such as specifying the correct system response, the process can be highly subjective.",
        "For example, should the correct answer to the query, \" Do you know of any Chinese restaurants?\" be simply, \"Yes,\" or a list of the restaurants that the system knows?",
        "It is important to point out that at no time is a human totally out of the evaluation loop.",
        "Even for something as innocent as word accuracy, we rely on the judgement of the transcriber for ambiguous events such as \"where is,\" versus \"where's,\" or \"I am\" versus \"I'm.\" Therefore, the issue is not whether the reference is obtained objectively, but the degree to which the reference is tainted by subjectivity.",
        "The outputs of the system modules naturally become more general at the higher levels of the system since these outputs represent more abstract information.",
        "Unfortunately, this makes an automatic comparison with a reference output more difficult, both because the correct response may become more ambiguous and because the output representation must become more flexible.",
        "The added flexibility that is necessary to express more general concepts also allows a given concept to be expressed in many ways, making the comparison with a reference more difficult.",
        "To evaluate these higher levels of the system, we will either have to restrict the representation and answers to be ones that are unambiguous enough to evaluate automatically, or adopt less objective evaluation criteria.",
        "We feel it is important not to restrict the representations and capabilities of the system on account of an inflexible evaluation process.",
        "Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of subjective evaluations of the system where we feel they are appropriate.",
        "For these evaluations, rather than automatically comparing the system response to a reference output, we present the input and output to human subjects and give them a set of categories for evaluating the response.",
        "At some levels of the system (for example evaluating the appropriateness of the response of the overall system) we have used subjects who were not previously familiar with the system, since we are interested in a user's evaluation of the system.",
        "For other components of the system, such as the translation from parse to action, we are interested in whether they performed as expected by their developers, so we have evaluated the output of these parts using people familiar with their function.",
        "In the following section, we present the results of applying various evaluation procedures to the VOYAGER system.",
        "We don't profess to know the answers regarding how performance evaluation should be achieved.",
        "By simply plunging in, we hope to learn something from this exercise."

        "However, we were somewhat surprised at the fact that the read speech results were very similar to the spontaneous speech ones (Figure 1).",
        "One possible reason is that the speaking rate for the read speech test set is very high, about 295 words/min compared to 180 words/min for the spontaneous speech and 210 words/min for the Resource Management February-89 test set.",
        "The read speech sentences were collected during the last five minutes of the recording session.",

        "In a parser many long-distance constraints are not detected until long after the word has been incorporated into the perplexity count.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"What does the nearest restaurant serve?\" would license the existence of \"does\" as a competitor for \"is\" following the word \"what.\" However, if \"does\" is actually substituted for \"is\" incorrectly in the sentence \"What is the nearest restaurant?\" the parse would fail at the end due to the absence of a predicate.",
        "It is difficult to devise a scheme that could accurately measure the gain realized in a parser due to long-distance memory that is not present in a word-pair grammar.",

        "We found a 2.5% reduction in coverage in this case, presumably due to back ups after false starts.",
        "Of course, we have not yet taken advantage of the constraint provided by TINA, except in an accept/reject mode for recognizer output.",

        "While some objective criteria exist for individual components, overall system performance should probably incorporate subjective judgements as well.",
        "Thus far, we have not addressed the issue of efficiency, mainly because we have not focussed our attention on that issue.",
        "When VOYAGER was first developed, it ran on a Symbolics Lisp machine, and took several minutes to process a sentence.",
        "More recently, we have started to use general signal processing boards to derive the auditory-based signal representation, and a Sun workstation to implement the remainder of the SUMMIT recognition system.",
        "Currently, the system runs in about 12 times real-time.",
        "The approximate breakdown in timing is shown in Table 3.",
        "Note that the natural language component and the back end run in well under real-time.",
        "Refined algorithms, along with the availability of faster workstations and more powerful signal processing chips should enable the current VOYAGER implementation to run in real-time in the future.",
        "On the other hand, the computation is likely to increase dramatically when speech recognition and natural language are fully integrated, since many linguistic hypotheses must be pursued in parallel."
