        "A massive amount of information is buried in scientific publications (more than 500,000 publications per year).",
        "Therefore, the need for information extraction (IE) and text mining in the life sciences is drastically increasing.",
        "Most of the ongoing work is being dedicated to deal with PubMed1 abstracts.",
        "The technical terminology of biomedicine presents the main challenge of applying IE to such a corpus (Hobbs, 2003).",
        "The goal of our work is to extract from biological abstracts which proteins are responsible for regulating the expression (i.e. transcription or translation) of which genes.",
        "This means to extract a specific type of pairwise relations between biological entities.",
        "This differs from the BioCreAtIvE competition tasks2 that aimed at classifying entities (gene products) into classes based on Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000).",
        "A task closely related to ours, which has received some attention over the past five years, is the extraction of protein–protein interactions from abstracts.",
        "This problem has mainly been addressed by statistical “bag of words” approaches (Marcotte et al., 2001), with the notable exception of Blaschke et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "All of the approaches differ significantly from ours by only attempting to extract the type of interaction and the participating proteins, disregarding agens and patiens.",
        "Most NLP based studies tend to have been focused on extraction of events involving one particular verb, e.g. bind (Thomas et al., 2000) or inhibit (Pustejovsky et al., 2002).",
        "From a biological point of view, there are two problems with such approaches: 1) the meaning of the extracted events",
        "will depend strongly on the selectional restrictions and 2) the same meaning can be expressed using a number of different verbs.",
        "In contrast and alike (Friedman et al., 2001), we instead set out to handle only one specific biological problem and, in return, extract the related events with their whole range of syntactic variations.",
        "The variety in the biological terminology used to describe regulation of gene expression presents a major hurdle to an IE approach; in many cases the information is buried to such an extent that even a human reader is unable to extract it unless having a scientific background in biology.",
        "In this paper we will show that by overcoming the terminological barrier, high precision extraction of entity relations can be achieved within the field of molecular biology.",
        "2 The biological task and our approach To extract relations, one should first recognize the named entities involved.",
        "This is particularly difficult in molecular biology where many forms of variation frequently occur.",
        "Synonymy is very common due to lack of standardization of gene names; BYP1, CIF1, FDP1, GGS1, GLC6, TPS1, TSS1, and YBR126C are all synonyms for the same gene/protein.",
        "Additionally, these names are subject to orthographic variation originating from differences in capitalization and hyphenation as well as syntactic variation of multiword terms (e.g. riboflavin synthetase beta chain = beta chain of riboflavin synthetase).",
        "Moreover, many names are homonyms since a gene and its gene product are usually named identically, causing crossover of terms between semantic classes.",
        "Finally, para-grammatical variations are more frequent in life science publications than in common English due to the large number of publications by non-native speakers (Netzel et al., 2003).",
        "Extracting that a protein regulates the expression of a gene is a challenging problem as this fact can be expressed in a variety of ways – possibly mentioning neither the biological process (expression) nor any of the two biological entities (genes and proteins).",
        "Figure 1 shows a simplified ontology providing an overview of the biological entities involved in gene expression, their ontological relationships, and how they can interact with",
        "tion regulation.",
        "The background color used for each term signifies its semantic role in relations: regulator (white), target (black), or either (gray).",
        "one another.",
        "An ontology is a great help when writing extraction rules, as it immediately suggests a large number of relevant relations to be extracted.",
        "Examples include “promoter contains upstream activating sequence” and “transcription regulator binds to promoter”, both of which follow from indirect relationships via binding site.",
        "It is often not known whether the regulation takes place at the level of gene transcription or translation or by an indirect mechanism.",
        "For this reason, and for simplicity, we decided against trying to extract how the regulation of expression takes place.",
        "We do, however, strictly require that the extracted relations provide information about a protein (the regulator, R) regulating the expression of a gene (the target, X), for which reason three requirements must be fulfilled: 1.",
        "It must be ascertained that the sentence mentions gene expression.",
        "“The protein R activates X” fails this requirement, as R might instead activate X post-translationally.",
        "Thus, whether the event should be extracted or not depends on the type of the accusative object X (e.g. gene or gene product).",
        "Without a head noun specifying the type, X remains ambiguous, leaving the whole relation underspeci",
        "fied, for which reason it should not be extracted.",
        "It should be noted that two thirds of the gene/protein names mentioned in our corpus are ambiguous for this reason.",
        "2.",
        "The identity of the regulator (R) must be known.",
        "“The X promoter activates X expression” fails this requirement, as it is not known which transcription factor activates the expression when binding to the X promoter.",
        "Linguistically this implies that noun chunks of certain semantic types should be disallowed as agens.",
        "3.",
        "The identity of the target (X) must be known.",
        "“The transcription factor R activates R dependent expression” fails this requirement, as it is not know which gene’s expression is dependent on R. The semantic types allowed for patiens should thus also be restricted.",
        "The two last requirements are important to avoid extraction from non-informative sentences that – despite them containing no information – occur quite frequently in scientific abstracts.",
        "The coloring of the entities in Figure 1 helps discern which relations are meaningful and which are not.",
        "The ability to genetically modify an organism in experiments brings about further complication to IE: biological texts often mention what takes place when an organism is artificially modified in a particular way.",
        "In some cases such modification can reverse part of the meaning of the verb: from the sentence “Deletion of R increased X expression” one can conclude that R represses expression of X.",
        "The key point is to identify that “deletion of R” implies that the sentence describes an experiment in which R has been removed, but that R would normally be present and that the biological impact of R is thus the opposite of what the verb increased alone would suggest.",
        "In other cases the verb will lose part of its meaning: “Mutation of R increased X expression” implies that R regulates expression X, but we cannot infer whether R is an activator or a repressor.",
        "In this case mutation is dealt in a manner similar to deletion in the previous example.",
        "Finally, there are those relations that should be completely avoided as they exist only because they have been artificially introduced through genetic engineering.",
        "In our extraction method we address all three cases.",
        "We have opted for a rule based approach (implemented as finite state automata) to extract the relations for two reasons.",
        "The first is, that a rule based approach allows us to directly ensure that the three requirements stated above are fulfilled for the extracted relations.",
        "This is desired to attain high accuracy on the extracted relations, which is what matters to the biologist.",
        "Hence, we focus in our evaluation on the semantic correctness of our method rather than on its grammatical correctness.",
        "As long as grammatical errors do not result in semantic errors, we do not consider it an error.",
        "Conversely, even a grammatically correct extraction is considered an error if it is semantically wrong.",
        "Our second reason for choosing a rule based approach is that our approach is theory-driven and highly interdisciplinary, involving computational linguists, bioinformaticians, and biologists.",
        "The rule based approach allows us to benefit more from the interplay of scientists with different backgrounds, as known biological constraints can be explicitly incorporated in the extraction rules."
