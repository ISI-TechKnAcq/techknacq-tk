        "According to Chomsky's Principles and Parameters Theory (Chomsky 1981), the UG is composed of principles and parameters, and the process of learning a language is regarded as the setting of values of a number of parameters, given exposure to this particular language.",

        "This proposal suggests that human languages follow a common set of principles and differ among one another only in finitely many respects, represented by a finite number of parameters that can vary according to a finite number of values (which makes them learnable in Gold's paradigm).",
        "In this section, we discuss the UG and associated parameters, which are formalised in terms of a Unification-Based Generalised Categorial Grammar (UB-GCG), embedded in a default inheritance network of lexical types.",
        "We concentrate on the description of word order parameters, which reflect the basic order in which constituents occur in different languages.",
        "UB-GCGs extend the basic Categorial Grammars ((Bar Hillel, 1964)) by including the use of attribute-value pairs associated with each category and by using a larger set of rules and operators.",
        "Words, categories and rules are represented in terms of typed default feature structures (TDFss), that encode orthographic, syntactic and semantic information.",
        "There are two types of categories: atomic categories (s - sentence-, np - noun phrase-, and n - noun), that are saturated, and complex categories, that are unsaturated.",
        "Complex categories have a functor category (defined in RESULT), and a list of subcategorised elements (defined in ACTIVE), with each element in the list defined in terms of two features: SIGN, encoding the category, and DIRECTION, encoding the direction in which the category is to be combined (where VALUE can be either forward or backward).",
        "As an example, in English an intransitive verb (s \\ np) is encoded as shown in figure 1, where only the relevant attributes are shown.",
        "In this work, we employ the rules of (forward and backward) application, (forward and backward) composition and generalised weak permutation.",
        "A more detailed description of the UB-GCG used can be found in (Villavicencio 2000).",
        "The UG is implemented as a UB-GCG, embedded in a default inheritance network of lexical types (Villavicencio 1999), implemented in the YADU framework (Lascarides and Copes-take 1999).",
        "The categories and rules in the grammar are defined as types in the hierarchy, represented in terms of TDFSs and the feature-structures associated with any given category or rule are defined by the inheritance chain.",
        "With different sub-networks used to encode different kinds of linguistic knowledge, linguistic regularities are encoded near the top of a network, while types further down the network are used to represent sub-regularities or exceptions.",
        "Thus, types are concisely defined, with only specific information being described, since more general information is inherited from the super-types.",
        "The resulting UB-GCG is compact, since it avoids redundant specifications and the information is structured in a clear and concise way through the specification of linguistic regularities and sub-regularities and exceptions.",
        "Regarding the categories of the UB-GCG, word order parameters are those that specify the direction of each element in the subcate-gorisation list of a complex category.",
        "In figure 1, subjdir is a parameter specifying that the np subject is to be combined backwards.",
        "As the categories are defined in terms of an inheritance hierarchy, the parameters (and their values) in these categories are propagated throughout the hierarchy, from supertypes to subtypes, which inherit this information by default.",
        "There are 28 parameters defined, and they are also in a hierarchical relationship, with the supertype being gendir, which specifies, by default, the general direction for a language, and from which all the other parameters inherit.",
        "Among the subtypes, we have subjdir, which specifies the direction of the subject, vargdir, which specifies the direction of the other verbal arguments and ndir, which specifies the direction of nominal categories.",
        "A fragment of the parameters hierarchy can be seen in figure 2.",
        "With these 28 binary-valued parameters the UG defines a space of almost 800 grammars.",
        "The parameters are set based on exposure to a particular language, and while they are unset, they inherit their value by default, from their supertypes.",
        "Then, when they are set, they can either continue to inherit by default, in case they have the same value as the supertype, or they can override this default and specify their own value, breaking the inheritance chain.",
        "For instance, in the case of English, the value of",
        "gendir is defined, by default, as forward, capturing the fact that it is a predominantly right-branching language, and all its subtypes, like subjdir and vargdir inherit this default information.",
        "Then an intransitive verb, which has the direction of the subject specified by subjdir, will be defined as S/NP, with subjdir having default value forward.",
        "However, as in English, the subject NP occurs to the left of the verb, utterances with the subject to the left will trigger a change in subjdir to backward, which overrides the default value, breaking the inheritance chain, figure 3.",
        "As a result, intransitive verbs are defined as S\\NP, figure 1, for the grammar to account for these sentences.",
        "In the syntactic dimension of this network, intransitive verbs can be considered the general case of verbs, and the information defined in this node is propagated through the hierarchy to its subtypes, such as the transitive verbs, figure 3.",
        "For the learner, the information about subjects (subjdir = backward) has already been acquired while learning intransitive verbs, and the learner does not need to learn it again for transitive verbs, which not only inherit this information, but also have the direction for the object defined by vargdir (vargdir = forward), as shown in figure 3.",
        "The use of a default inheritance schema reduces the pieces of information to be acquired by the learner, since the information is structured and what it learns is not a single isolated category, but a structure that represents this information in a general manner.",
        "This is a clear and concise way of defining the UG with the parameters being straightforwardly defined in the categories, in a way that takes advantage of the default inheritance mechanism, to propagate information about parameters, throughout the lexical inheritance network."

        "Initially, in the learning process, the posterior probability associated with each parameter is initialised to the prior probability, and these values are going to define the parameter settings used.",
        "Then, as trigger sentences are successfully parsed, the posterior probabilities of the parameter settings that allowed the sentence to be parsed are reinforced.",
        "Otherwise, when a sentence cannot be parsed (with the correct logical form) the learning algorithm checks if a successful parse can be achieved by changing the values of some of the parameters, in constrained ways.",
        "If that is the case, the posterior probability of the values used are reinforced in each of the parameters, and if they achieve a certain threshold, they are retained as the current values, otherwise the previous values are kept.",
        "This constraint on the setting of the parameters ensures that a trigger does not cause an immediate change to a different grammar.",

        "Table 1 shows a possible initialisation for the subjdir parameter, where the prior has a weight of 1/10 for forward, corresponding to a probability of 0.1, and a weight of",

        "Table 2 shows the status of the parameter after 5 triggers that provided evidence for the value backward.",
        "Initially, the learner uses the evidence provided by the triggers to choose certain parameter values, in order to be able to parse these triggers successfully while generating the appropriate logical form.",
        "After that, the triggers are used to reinforce these values, or to negate them.",
