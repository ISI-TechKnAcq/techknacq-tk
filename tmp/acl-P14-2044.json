        "The morphosyntactic function of words is reflected in two ways: their distributional properties, and their morphological structure.",
        "Each information source has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Distributional similarity varies smoothly with syntactic function, so that words with similar syntactic functions should have similar distributional properties.",
        "In contrast, there can be multiple paradigms for a single morphological inflection (such as past tense in English).",
        "But accurate computation of distributional similarity requires large amounts of data, which may not be available for rare words; morphological rules can be applied to any word regardless of how often it appears.",
        "These observations suggest that a general approach to the induction of syntactic categories should leverage both distributional and morphological features (Clark, 2003; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "But these features are difficult to combine because of their disparate representations.",
        "Distributional information is typically represented in numerical vectors, and recent work has demonstrated the utility of continuous vector represen-tations, or ?embeddings?",
        "(Mikolov et al., 2013; Luong et al., 2013; Kim and de Marneffe, 2013; Turian et al., 2010).",
        "In contrast, morphology is often represented in terms of sparse, discrete features (such as morphemes), or via pairwise measures such as string edit distance.",
        "Moreover, the mapping between a surface form and morphology is complex and nonlinear, so that simple metrics such as edit distance will only weakly approximate morphological similarity.",
        "In this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model based on the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP; Blei and Frazier, 2011).",
        "In the dd-CRP, each data point (word type) selects another point to ?follow?",
        "; this chain of following links corresponds to a partition of the data points into clusters.",
        "The probability of word w 1 following w 2 depends on two factors: 1) the distributional similarity between all words in the proposed partition containing w 1 and w 2 , which is encoded using a Gaussian likelihood function over the word embed-dings; and 2) the morphological similarity between w 1 and w 2 , which acts as a prior distribution on the induced clustering.",
        "We use a log-linear model to capture suffix similarities between words, and learn the feature weights by iterating between sampling and weight learning.",
        "We apply our model to the English section of the the Multext-East corpus (Erjavec, 2004) in order to evaluate both against the coarse-grained and 265 fine-grained tags, where the fine-grained tags encode detailed morphological classes.",
        "We find that our model effectively combines morphological features with distributional similarity, outperforming comparable alternative approaches.",
        "2 Related work Unsupervised POS tagging has a long history in NLP.",
        "This paper focuses on the POS induction problem (i.e., no tag dictionary is available), and here we limit our discussion to very recent systems.",
        "A review and comparison of older systems is provided by Christodoulopoulos et al. (2010), who found that imposing a one-tag-per-word-type constraint to reduce model flexibility tended to improve system performance; like other recent systems, we impose that constraint here.",
        "Recent work also shows that the combination of morphological and distributional information yields the best results, especially cross-linguistically (Clark, 2003; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "Since then, most systems have incorporated morphology in some way, whether as an initial step to obtain prototypes for clusters (Abend et al., 2010), or as features in a generative model (Lee et al., 2010; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011; Sirts and Alum?ae, 2012), or a representation-learning algorithm (Yat- baz et al., 2012).",
        "Several of these systems use a small fixed set of orthographic and/or suffix fea-tures, sometimes obtained from an unsupervised morphological segmentation system (Abend et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011; Yatbaz et al., 2012).",
        "Blunsom and Cohn's (2011) model learns an n-gram character model over the words in each cluster; we learn a log-linear model, which can incorporate arbitrary features.",
        "Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010) also include a log-linear model of morphology in POS induc-tion, but they use morphology in the likelihood term of a parametric sequence model, thereby encouraging all elements that share a tag to have the same morphological features.",
        "In contrast, we use pairwise morphological similarity as a prior in a non-parametric clustering model.",
        "This means that the membership of a word in a cluster requires only morphological similarity to some other element in the cluster, not to the cluster centroid; which may be more appropriate for languages with multiple morphological paradigms.",
        "Another difference is that our non-parametric formulation makes it unnecessary to know the number of tags in advance.",
        "3 Distance-dependent CRP The ddCRP (Blei and Frazier, 2011) is an extension of the CRP; like the CRP, it defines a distribution over partitions (?table assignments?)",
        "of data points (?customers?).",
        "Whereas in the regular CRP each customer chooses a table with probability proportional to the number of customers already sitting there, in the ddCRP each customer chooses another customer to follow, and sits at the same table with that customer.",
        "By identifying the connected components in this graph, the ddCRP equivalently defines a prior over clusterings.",
        "If c i is the index of the customer followed by customer i, then the ddCRP prior can be written P (c i = j) ?",
        "{ f(d ij ) if i 6= j ?",
        "if i = j, (1) where d ij is the distance between customers i and j and f is a decay function.",

        "when i > j and f(?)",
        "= 0.",
        "In this case, if d ij = 1 for all i < j then the ddCRP reduces to the CRP.",
        "Separating the distance and decay function makes sense for ?natural?",
        "distances (e.g., the number of words between word i and j in a document, or the time between two events), but they can also be collapsed into a single similarity function.",
        "We wish to assign higher similarities to pairs of words that share meaningful suffixes.",
        "Because we do not know which suffixes are meaningful a priori, we use a maximum entropy model whose features include all suffixes up to length three that are shared by at least one pair of words.",
        "Our prior is then: P (c i = j|w, ?)",

        "if i = j, (2) where g s (i, j) is 1 if suffix s is shared by ith and jth words, and 0 otherwise.",
        "We can create an infinite mixture model by combining the ddCRP prior with a likelihood function defining the probability of the data given the cluster assignments.",
        "Since we are using continuous-valued vectors (word embeddings) to represent the distributional characteristics of words, we use a multivariate Gaussian likelihood.",

        "We evaluate on the English part of the Multext-East (MTE) corpus (Erjavec, 2004), which provides both coarse-grained and fine-grained POS labels for the text of Orwell's ?1984?.",
        "Coarse labels consist of 11 main word classes, while the fine-grained tags (104 for English) are sequences of detailed morphological attributes.",
        "Some of these attributes are not well-attested in English (e.g. gender) and some are mostly distinguishable via semantic analysis (e.g. 1st and 2nd person verbs).",
        "Many tags are assigned only to one or a few words.",
        "Scores for the fine-grained tags will be lower for these reasons, but we argue below that they are still informative.",

        "take the intersection of these two sets for training and evaluation.",
        "Table 1 shows corpus statistics.",
        "Evaluation With a few exceptions (Biemann, 2006; Van Gael et al., 2009), POS induction systems normally require the user to specify the number of desired clusters, and the systems are evaluated with that number set to the number of tags in the gold standard.",
        "For corpora such as MTE with both fine-grained and coarse-grained tages, previous evaluations have scored against the coarse-grained tags.",
        "Though coarse-grained tags have their place (Petrov et al., 2012), in many cases the distributional and morphological distinctions between words are more closely aligned with the fine-grained tagsets, which typically distinguish between verb tenses, noun number and gender, and adjectival scale (comparative, superlative, etc.",
        "), so we feel that the evaluation against fine-grained tagset is more relevant here.",
        "For better comparison with previous work, we also evaluate against the coarse-grained tags; however, these numbers are not strictly comparable to other scores reported on MTE because we are only able to train and evaluate on the subset of words that also have Polyglot embeddings.",
        "To provide some measure of the difficulty of the task, we report baseline scores using K-means clustering, which is relatively strong baseline in this task (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011).",
        "There are several measures commonly used for unsupervised POS induction.",
        "We report greedy one-to-one mapping accuracy (1-1) (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) and the information-theoretic score V-measure (V-m), which also varies from 0 to 100% (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007).",
        "In previous work it has been common to also report many-to-one (m-1) mapping but this measure is particularly sensitive to the number of induced clusters (more clusters yield higher scores), which is variable for our models.",
        "V-m can be somewhat sensitive to the number of clusters (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009) but much less so than m-1 (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010).",
        "With different number of induced and gold standard clusters the 1-1 measure suffers because some induced clusters cannot be mapped to gold clusters or vice versa.",
        "However, almost half the gold standard clusters in MTE contain just a few words and we do not expect our model to be able to learn them anyway, so the 1-1 measure is still useful for telling us how well the model learns the bigger and more distinguishable classes.",
        "In unsupervised POS induction it is standard to report accuracy on tokens even when the model itself works on types.",
        "Here we report also type-based measures because these can reveal differences in model behavior even when token-based measures are similar.",
