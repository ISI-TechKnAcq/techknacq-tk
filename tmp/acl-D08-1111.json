        "On the training corpus composed of query items, a ranking model is learned by a widely-used tool Ranking SVM, with some useful statistical features, such as mutual information, difference of t-test, frequency and dictionary information.",
        "Experimental results show that, this method is able to eliminate overlapping ambiguity much more effectively, compared to the current word segmentation methods.",
        "Furthermore, as this strategy naturally generates segmentation results with different granularity, the performance of CIR systems is improved and achieves the state of the art."

        "To improve information retrieval systems' performance, it is important to comprehend both queries and corpus precisely.",
        "Unlike English and other western languages, Chinese does not delimit words by white-space.",
        "Word segmentation is therefore a key preprocessor for Chinese information retrieval to comprehend sentences.",
        "Due to the characteristics of Chinese, two main problems remain unresolved in word segmentation: segmentation ambiguity and unknown words, which are also demonstrated to affect the performance of Chinese information retrieval (Foo and Li, 2004).",
        "Overlapping ambiguity and combinatory ambiguity are two forms of segmentation ambiguity.",
        "The first one refers to that ABC can be segmented into AB C or A BC.",
        "The second one refers to that string AB can be a word, or A can be a word and B can be a word.",
        "In CIR, the combinatory ambiguity is also called segmentation granularity problem (Fan et al., 2007).",
        "There are many researches on the relationship between word segmentation and Chinese information retrieval (Foo and Li, 2004; Peng et al., 2002a; Peng et al., 2002b; Jin and Wong, 2002).",
        "Their studies show that the segmentation accuracy does not monotonically influence subsequent retrieval performance.",
        "Especially the overlapping ambiguity, as shown in experiments of (Wang, 2006), will cause more performance decrement of CIR.",
        "Thus a CIR system with a word segmenter better solving the overlapping ambiguity, may achieve better performance.",
        "Besides, it also showed that the precision of new word identification was more important than the recall.",
        "There are some researches show that when compound words are split into smaller constituents, better retrieval results can be achieved (Peng et al., 2002a).",
        "On the other hand, it is reasonable that the longer the word which coexists in query and corpus, the more similarity they may have.",
        "A hypothesis, therefore, comes to our mind, that different segmentation granularity can be incorporated to obtain better CIR performance.",
        "In this paper we present a novel word segmentation approach for CIR, which can not only obviously reduce the overlapping ambiguity, but also introduce different segmentation granularity for the first time.",

        "In our method, we first predict the ranking result of all internal association strength (IAS) between each pair of adjacent characters in a sentence using Ranking SVM model, and then, we segment the sentence into sub-sentences with smaller and smaller granularity by cutting adjacent character pairs according to this rank.",
        "Other machine-learning based segmentation algorithms (Zhang et al., 2003; Lafferty et al., 2001; Ng and Low, 2004) treat segmentation problem as a character sequence tagging problem based on classification.",

        "This paper is structured as follows.",

        "Various methods have been proposed to address the word segmentation problem in previous studies.",
        "They fall into two main categories, rule-based approaches that make use of linguistic knowledge and statistical approaches that train on corpus with machine learning methods.",
        "In rule-based approaches, algorithms of string matching based on dictionary are the most commonly used, such as maximum matching.",
        "They firstly segment sentences according to a dictionary and then resort to some rules to resolve ambiguities (Liu, 2002; Luo and Song, 2001).",
        "These rule-based methods are fast, however, their performances depend on the dictionary which cannot include all words, and also on the rules which cost a lot of time to make and must be updated frequently.",
        "Recent years statistical approaches became more popular.",
        "These methods take advantage of various probability information gained from large corpus to segment sentences.",
        "Among them, Wang's work (Wang, 2006) is the most similar to our method, since both of us apply statistics information of each gap in the sentence to eliminate overlapping ambiguity in methods.",
        "However, when combining different statistics, Wang decided the weight by a heuristic way which was too simply to be suitable for all sentences.",
        "In our method, we employ a machine-learning method to train features' weights.",
        "Many machine-learning methods, such as",
        "HMM (Zhang et al., 2003), CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001), Maximum Entropy (Ng and Low, 2004), have been exploited in segmentation task.",
        "To our knowledge, machine-learning methods used in segmentation treated word segmentation as a character tagging problem.",
        "According to the model trained from training corpus and features extracted from the context in the sentence, these methods assign each character a positional tag, indicating its relative position in the word.",
        "These methods are difficult to get different granularity segmentation results directly.",
        "Our method has two main differences with them.",
        "Firstly, we tag the gap between characters rather than characters themselves.",
        "Secondly, our method is based on ranking rather than classification.",

        "Traditional segmentation methods always take the segmentation problem as classification problem and give a definite segmentation result.",
        "In our approach, we try to solve word segmentation problem from the view of ranking.",
        "For easy understanding, let's represent a Chinese sentence S as a character sequence:",
        "We also explicitly show the gap Gi(i = 1.. .n – 1) between every two adjacent characters Ci and Ci+1:",
        "IASi(i = 1 ...n) is corresponding to Gi(i = 1.. .n), reflecting the internal association strength between Ci and Ci+1.",
        "The higher the IAS value is, the stronger the associative between the two characters is.",
        "If the association between two characters is weak, then they can be segmented.",
        "Otherwise, they should be unsegmented.",
        "That is to say we could make segmentation based on the ranking of IAS value.",
        "In our ranking-style segmentation method, Ranking SVM is exploited to predict IAS ranking.",
        "In next subsections, we will introduce how to take advantage of Ranking SVM model to solve our problem.",
        "Then, we will describe features used for training the Ranking SVM model.",
        "Finally, we will give a scheme how to get segmentation result from predicted ranking result of Ranking SVM.",
        "Ranking SVM is a classical algorithm for ranking, which formalizes learning to rank as learning for classification on pairs of instances and tackles the classification issue by using SVM (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Suppose that XeRd is the feature space, where d is the number of features, and Y = r1,r2,... ,rK is the set of labels representing ranks.",
        "And there exists a total order between ranks r1 > r2 > ... > rK, where > denotes the order relationship.",
        "The actual task of learning is formalized as a Quadratic Programming problem as shown below:",
        "where denotes l2 norm measuring the margin of the hyperplane and (ij denotes a slack variable.",
        "xi y xj means the rank class of xi has an order prior to that of xj, i.e. Y (xi) > Y (xj ).",
        "Suppose that the solution to (1) is w*, then we can make the ranking function as f (x) = (w*,x).",
        "When applying Ranking SVM model to our problems, an instance (feature vector x) is created from all bigrams (namely CiCi+1,i = 1 ...n – 1) of a sentence in the training corpus.",
        "Each feature is defined as a function of bigrams (we will describe features in detail in next subsection).",
        "The instances from all sentences are then combined for training.",
        "And Y refers to the class label of the IAS degree.",
        "As we mentioned above, segmentation decision is based on IAS value.",
        "Therefore, the number of IAS degree's class label is also correspondent to the number of segmentation class label.",
        "In traditional segmentation algorithms, they always label segmentation as two classes, segmented and unsegmented.",
        "However, for some phrases, it is a dilemma to make a segmentation decision based on this two-class scheme.",
        "For example, Chinese phrase \"^iô^Nïlï(Notepad)'' can be segmented as id ^(Note)\" and ''4jS(computer)'' or can be viewed as one word.",
        "We cannot easily classify the gap between and \"J8\" as segmented or unsegmented.",
        "Therefore, beside these two class labels, we define another class label, semisegmented, which means that the gap between two characters could be segmented or unsegmented, either will be right.",
        "Correspondingly, IAS degree is also divided into three classes, definitely inseparable (marked as 3), partially inseparable (marked as 2), and separable (marked as 1).",
        "\"Separable\" corresponds to be segmented\"; \"partially inseparable\" corresponds to semisegmented; \"definitely inseparable\" corresponds to be unsegmented.",
        "Obviously, there exists orders between these labels' IAS values, namely IAS(1) < IAS(2) < IAS(3),IAS(*) represents the IAS value of different labels.",
        "Next, we will describe the features used to train Ranking SVM model.",
        "Mutual Information: Mutual information, measuring the relationship between two variables, has been extensively used in computational language research.",
        "Given a Chinese character string ' xy' (as mentioned above, in our method, ' xy' refers to bigram in a sentence), mutual information between characters x and y is defined as follows:",
        "where p(x, y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y, namely the probability that bigram ' xy' occurs in the training corpus, and p(x),p(y) are the independent probabilities of x and y respectively.",
        "From (2), we conclude that mi(x, y) » 0 means that IAS is strong; mi(x,y) œ 0 means that it is indefinite for IAS between characters x and y; mi(x,y) ^ 0 means that there is no association been characters x and y.",
        "However, mutual information has no consideration of context, so it cannot solve the overlapping ambiguity effectively (Sili Wang 2006).",
        "To remedy this defect, we introduce another statistics measure, difference of t-test.",
        "Difference of t-score (DT S): Difference of t-score is proposed on the basis of t-score.",
        "Given a Chinese character string ' xyz', the t-score of the character y relevant to character x and z is defined where p(y\\x) is the conditional probability of y given x, and p(z\\y), of z given y, and a2(p(y\\x)), a2(p(z\\y)) are variances of p(y\\x) and of p(z\\y) respectively.",
        "Sun et al.",
        "gave the derivation formula of ^2(p(y\\x)),a2(p(z\\y)) (Sunetal., 1997) as where r(x, y), r(y, z), r(y), r(z) are the frequency of string xy, yz, y, and z respectively.",
        "Thus formula (3) is deducted as tx,z (y) indicates the binding tendency of y in the context of x and z: if txz(y) > 0 then y tends to be bound with z rather than with x; if txz(y) < 0, they y tends to be bound with x rather than with z.",
        "To measure the binding tendency between two adjacent characters 'xy' (also, it refers to bigram in a sentence in our method), we use difference of t-score (DTS) (Sun et al., 1998) which is defined as",
        "Higher dts(x,y) indicates stronger IAS between adjacent characters x and y.",
        "Dictionary Information: Both statistics measures mentioned above cannot avoid sparse data problem.",

        "Frequency: An important characteristic of new word is its repeatability.",
        "Thus, we also use frequency as another feature to train Ranking SVM model.",
        "Here, the frequency is referred to the number of times that a bigram occurs in the training corpus.",

        "The feature vectors of all these bigrams for training are shown in Table 1.",
        "In order to compare with other segmentation methods, which give a segmentation result based on two class labels, segmented and unsegmented, it is necessary to convert real numbers result given by Ranking SVM to these two labels.",
        "Here, we make a heuristic scheme to segment the sentence based on IAS ranking result predicted by Ranking SVM.",
        "The scheme is described in Algorithm 1.",
        "In each iteration we cut the sentence at the gap with minimum IAS value.",
        "Nie et.al.",
        "pointed out that the average length of words in usage is 1.59 (Nie et al., 2000).",
        "Therefore, we stop the segmentation iterative when the length of sub_sentence is 2 or less than 2.",
        "By this method, we could represent the segmentation result as a binary tree.",

        "Effects of corpus size:We trained different Ranking SVM models with different corpus size to investigate the effects of training corpus size to our method performance.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3.",

        "Effects on Finding Boundary: In algorithm 1, we could get different granularity segmentation words when we chose different length as stop condition.",
        "Figure 4 shows the \"boundary precision\" at each stop condition.",
        "Here, \"boundary precision\" is defined as No.of right cut boundaries No.of all cut boundaries",
        "From the result shown in figure 4, we can see that as the segmentation granularity gets smaller, the boundary precision gets lower.",
        "The reason is obvious, that we may segment a whole word into smaller parts.",
        "However, as we analyzed in introduction, in CIR, we should judge words boundaries correctly to avoid overlapping ambiguity.",

        "The result is shown in Table 4.",
        "On these three test corpus, the NOA of our approach is smallest, which indicates our method resolve overlapping ambiguity more effectively.",
        "For example, the sentence \"Sift iicft(basic notes)\", the segmentation result of ICTCLAS is \"ÄrÄGbasic class)/ft(article)\", the word \"iicft(notes)\" is segmented, overlapping ambiguity occurring.",
        "However, with our method, the predicted IAS value rank of positions between every two adjacent characters in this sentence is \"Ä3^1^2ft\", which indicates that the character \"ii\" has stronger internal associative strength with the character \"t\" than with the character \"ïiîii\", eliminating overlapping ambiguity according to this ISA rank results.",
