        "In most of the existing approaches, following (Brown et al., 1993), Eq.",
        "(1) is factored using the source-channel model into where the two models, the translation model, p(SIT), and the language model (LM), p(T), are estimated separately: the former using a parallel corpus and a hidden alignment model and the latter using a typically much larger monolingual corpus.",
        "The weighting factor A is typically tuned on a development test set by optimizing a translation accuracy criterion such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "In recent years, among all the proposed approaches, the phrase-based method has become the widely adopted one in SMT due to its capability of capturing local context information from adjacent words.",
        "Word order in the translation output relies on how the phrases are reordered based on both language model scores and distortion cost/penalty (Koehn et al., 2003), among all the features utilized in a maximum-entropy (loglinear) model (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "The distortion cost utilized during the decoding is usually a penalty linearly proportional to the number of words in the source sentence that are skipped in a translation path.",
        "In this paper, we propose several novel approaches to improve reordering in the phrase-based translation with a maximum-entropy model.",
        "In Section 2, we review the previous work that focused on the distortion and phrase reordering in SMT.",
        "In Section 3, we briefly review the baseline of this work.",
        "In Section 4, we introduce a smoothed prior probability by taking into account the distortions in the priors.",
        "In Section 5, we present multiple novel distortion features based on syntactic parsing.",
        "A new distortion evaluation metric is proposed in Section 6 and experimental results on a large-scale Chinese-English machine translation task are reported in Section 7.",

        "Significant amount of research has been conducted in the past on the word reordering problem in SMT.",
        "In (Brown et al., 1993) IBM Models 3 through 5 model reordering based on the surface word information.",
        "For example, Model 4 attempts to assign target-language positions to source-language words by modeling d(j\\i,K,L) where j is the target-language position, i is the source-language position, K and L are respectively source and target sentence lengths.",
        "These models are not effective in modeling reordering because they do not have enough context and lack structural information.",
        "Phrase-based SMT systems such as (Koehn et al., 2003) move from using words as translation units to using phrases.",
        "One of the advantages of phrase-based SMT systems is that the local reordering is inherent in the phrase translations.",
        "However, phrase-based SMT systems capture reordering instances and not reordering phenomena.",
        "It has trouble to produce the right translation order if the training data does not contain the specific phrase pairs.",
        "For example, phrases do not capture the phenomenon that Arabic adjectives and nouns need to be reordered.",
        "Instead of directly modeling the distance of word movement, some phrase-level reordering models indicate how to move phrases, also called orientations.",
        "Orientations typically apply to the adjacent phrases.",
        "Two adjacent phrases can be either placed monotonically (sometimes called straight) or swapped (non-monotonically or inverted).",
        "In (Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zens and Ney, 2006; Ni et al., 2009), people presented models that use lexical features from the phrases to predict their orientations.",
        "These models are very powerful in predicting local phrase placements.",
        "In (Galley and Manning, 2008) a hierarchical orientation model is introduced that captures some non-local phrase reordering by a shift reduce algorithm.",
        "Because of the heavy use of lexical features, these models tend to suffer from data sparseness problems.",
        "bilistic reordering model is presented to model directly the source translation sequence and explicitly assign probabilities to the reordering of the source input with no restrictions on gap, length or adjacency.",
        "The reordering model is used to generate a reordering lattice which encodes many reordering and their costs (negative log probability).",
        "Another recent work is (Green et al., 2010), which estimates future linear distortion cost and presents a discriminative distortion model that predicts word movement during translation based on multiple features.",
        "This work differentiates itself from all the previous work on the phrase reordering as the following.",
        "Firstly, we propose a smoothed distortion prior probability in the maximum-entropy-based MT framework.",
        "It not only takes into account the distortion in the prior, but also alleviates the data sparseness problem.",
        "Secondly, we propose multiple syntactic features based on the source-side parse tree to capture the reordering phenomena between two different languages.",
        "The correct reordering patterns will be automatically favored during the decoding, due to the higher weights obtained through the maximum entropy training on the parallel data.",
        "Finally, we also introduce a new metric to quantify the effect on the distortions in different systems.",
        "The experiments on a Chinese-English MT task show that these proposed approaches additively improve both the distortion and translation performance significantly."

        "In this work, pg is estimated based on either source POS (if it's a single-word source phrase) or source phrase size (if it's more than one word long), as shown below.",
