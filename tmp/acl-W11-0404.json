        "There has been a great deal of excitement recently about using the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to collect data of all kinds, quickly and cheaply (Howe, 2008; von Ahn and Dabbish, 2008).",
        "Snow et al.",
        "(Snow et al., 2008) were the first to give a convincing demonstration that at least some kinds of linguistic data can be gathered from workers on the web more cheaply than and as accurately as from local experts, and there has been a steady stream of papers and workshops since then with similar results.",
        "e.g. (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).",
        "Many of the tasks which have been successfully crowdsourced involve judgments which are similar to those performed in everyday life, such as recognizing unclear writing (von Ahn et al., 2008), or, for those tasks that require considerable judgment, the responses are usually binary or from a small set of responses, such as sentiment analysis (Mellebeek et al., 2010) or ratings (Heilman and Smith, 2010).",
        "Since the FrameNet process is known to be relatively expensive, we were interested in whether the FrameNet process of fine word sense discrimination and marking of dependents with semantic roles could be performed more cheaply and equally accurately using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) or similar resources.",

      "text": [
        "The usual FrameNet process for annotating examples of a particular lexical unit (LU), is to first extract examples of this sense from a corpus, based on collocational and syntactic patterns, storing them in subcorpora; this process is called subcorporation.",
        "Given an LU, vanguarders begin by composing rules consisting of syntactic patterns and instructions as to whether to include or exclude the sentences that match them.",
        "An automated system extracts sentences containing uses of the LU's lemma, applies POS tagging and chunk parsing, and then matches the sentences against the rules in their specified order to allow for cascading effects.",
        "Ultimately, the result is a set of subcorpora, each corresponding to a pattern, and containing sentences likely to exhibit a use of the LU.",
        "More recently, a system has been developed in collaboration with the Sketch Engine ((Kilgarriff etal., July 2004) http://www.sketchengine.",
        "co.uk) to accelerate this process by giving annotators a graphical interface in which precomputed collocational pattern matches can be more directly assigned to the various LUs corresponding to a given lemma.",
        "The actual annotation of the frame elements (FEs) is facilitated by having preselected sets of sentences which are at least likely to contain the right sense of the word, and which share a syntactic pattern.",
        "Therefore, we first focused on the frame discrimination task (which in other contexts would be called word sense discrimination), which we assumed to be simpler to collect data for than the FE annotation task, and which is a prerequisite for it.",
        "We began by evaluating the resources that AMT provides for designing and implementing Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs); we quickly determined that the UI provided by AMT would not suffice for the task we planned.",
        "Specifically, it lacks the ability to:",
        "• randomize the selection options,",
        "• present questions from a set one at a time,",
        "• randomize the order in which a set of questions are presented, or",
        "• record response times for each question.",
        "We therefore decided to design our HITs using Amazon's \"External Question HIT Type\", and to serve the HITs from our own web server.",
        "In this system, when workers view or execute a HIT, the content of the HIT window is supplied from our server, and responses are stored directly in a database running our own server, rather than Amazon's.",
        "Workers log in through AMT and are ultimately paid through AMT, but the content of the tasks can be completely controlled though our web server.",
        "The Frame Discrimination Task can be set up in a number of ways, such as:",
        "1.",
        "Present a single sentence with the lemma highlighted.",
        "Workers must select a frame (or \"none of the above\") from a multiple-choice list of frames we provide.",
        "2.",
        "Present a list of sentences all containing uses of the same lemma.",
        "Workers must check off all the sentences that contain uses of a given frame.",
        "3.",
        "Present a list of sentences all containing uses of the same lemma.",
        "Provide one example sentence from each frame and ask users to categorize the sentences.",
        "In order to get started as quickly as possible and get a baseline result, we chose the first of the above methods, which is the most straightforward from a theoretical point of view.",
        "For example, the lemma might be gain.v, which has two LUs, one in the Change_position_on_a_scale frame, and another in the Getting frame.",
        "The HIT displays one sentence at a time, with the lemma highlighted; below the sentence, a multiple-choice selection is presented with the Frame names:",
        "You will have to GAIN their support, if change is to be brought about.",
        "Change_position_on_a_scale Getting",
        "None of the above",
        "When users mouse-over the name of a frame, a pop-up displays an example sentence from that Frame (from a different LU in the same frame).",
        "Users can also click the name of the frame, which causes the browser to open another window with the frame definition.",
        "This process repeats for 12 sentences, at which point the HIT is over, and results are entered into our database.",
        "Sources of material for testing",
        "We had no shortage of sentences for the frame discrimination task; we started with some of the many unannotated sentences already in the FrameNet database.",
        "In the usual process of subcorporation, each of the subcorpora matches one specific pattern; the goal is to extract roughly 20 examples of each collocational/syntactic pattern, and to annotate one or two of each.",
        "The following are examples from among the patterns used for rip.v in the Removing frame:",
        "The first pattern would match sentences like, \"I ripped the top from my pack of cigarettes,\" and the second, \"She ripped the telephone out of the wall.\"",
        "We do not presume, however, that we will always be able to define patterns for all of the possible valences of a predicator, so we also include two \"other\" subcorpora.",
        "The first of these (named \"other-matched\") contains 50 sentences (provided there are enough instances in the corpus) which matched any one of the preceding patterns but were left over after 20 had been extracted for each pattern.",
        "The second (\"other-unmatched\") contains sentences in which the lemma occurs (with the right POS) which did not match any of the earlier patterns.",
        "Vanguarders carefully check these \"other\" subcorpora to see if the lemma is used in a syntactic valence which was not foreseen; if they find any such new valences, they are annotated.",
        "Typically, this means that there are roughly 100 extra unannotated sentences for each LU.",
        "For this experiment, we extracted 10 sentences from the \"other-matched\" subcorpus of each of the LUs for the lemma, meaning that they had already matched some pattern which was designed for one of those LUs.",
        "In addition to the unannotated sentences, we randomly selected three annotated sentences from each LU, two to use as included gold-standard items for checking accuracy, and one to use as the example in the preview of the HIT.",
        "These sentences were randomized and separated into batches of 12 for each HIT; all of which were inserted into a database on a local web server.",
        "A local CGI script (reached from AMT) calls the database for the examples in each HIT and stores the workers' responses in the same database.",
        "We ran three trials under this setup, for the lemmas rip.v, high.a, and show.v.",
        "Based on the success of earlier studies, our concern initially was to make our tasks be sufficiently challenging so as to be useful for evaluating AMT.",
        "Thus, we chose lemmas with four to five senses rather than just two or three.",
        "In addition, for these three lemmas, each of the senses appears with sufficient frequency in the corpus so that all senses are realistically available for consideration.",
        "The frames for each of these lemmas are shown in Table 1; some of these distinctions are fairly subtle; we will discuss some examples below.",
        "To combine responses, we took the modal response as the result for each item; in cases of ties, we chose randomly, and split the response count where necessary.",
        "On this basis, for rip.v, the workers had an accuracy of 32.16 correct out of 48 items (67%), for high.a, they got 22 out of 49 correct (46%), and for show.v, 37 out of 60 items (62%), as shown in Table 2.",
        "If we consider that FrameNet has four senses (LUs) for rip.v and high.a and five for show.v, this might not sound too awful, but if we think of this as pre-processing, so that the resulting sentences can be annotated in the correct frame, it leaves a lot to be desired.",
        "If we raise the agreement criteria, by filtering out items on which the margin between the modal response and the next highest is 35% or greater (i.e. those with high agreement among workers), we can get higher accuracy (shown in the right two columns of Table 2), at the expense of failing to classify 3/4 of the items, hardly a solution to the problem.",
        "Trials with CrowdFlower",
        "We decided to try our task on CrowdFlower (http: //crowdflower.com, formerly Dolores Labs), a company that provides tools and custom solutions to make crowdsourcing tasks easier to create and manage, including techniques to assure a certain level of quality in the results.",
        "While working with Crowd-Flower, our tasks were running on AMT, although CrowdFlower also provides other labor pools, such as Samasource (http://www.samasource.org), depending on the nature of the task.",
        "We tried running the task for rip.v on Crowdflower's system, using the same HIT design as before, (recreated using their self-serve UI design tools), but with different sentences.",
        "Once again, we selected 12 sentences for each of the 4 LUs, for a total of 48 sentences.",
        "We wanted to collect 10 judgments per sentence, for a total of 480 judgments.",

        "Revised CrowdFlower Trials",
        "After our difficulties with the first trial on Crowd-Flower's system, we visited their offices for an on-site consultation.",
        "We learned more about how CrowdFlower's system works, and received suggestions on how to improve performance:",
        "• Run a larger set of data; they recommended at least 200 sentences for a job.",
        "• Embed 20% gold standard items so that there is at least one per page of questions, since, without gold standard items, workers will answer randomly, or always choose the first option.",
        "• Get rid of the frame names and use something easier to understand.",
        "• Provide more detailed instructions that include examples.",
        "Based on this consultation, we made the following changes in our HITs: (1) Replaced frame names with hand-crafted synonyms, (2) Renamed the task and rewrote all instructions to avoid jargon, (3) Removed links and roll-overs giving examples or referring people to external documentation, and (4) Extracted 60 sentences per LU, of which 10 are gold standard.",
        "Although we planned to do this for rip.v, high.a, and show.v, we found that it was too difficult to come up with synonyms for high.a, so we ran trials only for rip.v and show.v.",
        "For rip.v, with four senses, we collected 10 judgments each on 240 sentences, for a total of 2400 judgments.",
        "For show.v, with five senses, we collected 10 judgments each on 300 sentences, for a total of 3000 judgments.",
        "In the final trials, the weighted majority response provided by Crowd-Flower was found to be correct 75% for rip.v and 80% for show.v.",
        "This was encouraging, but we were concerned with the limitations of this method: (1) The calculation used to select the \"weighted majority response\" is proprietary to CrowdFlower, so that we could not know the details or change it, and (2) the final trials required handcrafted definitions, synonyms, and very clear definitions for each LU, which is at best time-consuming, and sometimes impossible (as is likely case for high.a), meaning the method will not scale well.",
        "As researchers, the first limitation is especially problematic as it is necessary to know exactly what methods we are using in our research and be able to share them openly.",
        "For these reasons, we decided to go back to building our own interfaces on AMT, and to look for approaches that would be more automatic.",
        "Return to AMT",
        "We redesigned the HIT around a pile-sorting model; instead of seeing one sentence and choosing between frames (whether by name or by synonym), workers are shown model sentences for each LU (i.e. in each frame), and then asked to categorize a list of sentences that are displayed all at once.",

        "We have shown that it is possible to set up HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk to discriminate the fairly fine sense distinctions used in FrameNet, if the right approach is taken, and that the results reach a level of accuracy that can be useful for further processing, as well as serving as a cross-check on the expert data and an invitation to rethink the task itself.",
        "Although the total amount of data collected may not be large by some standards, it has been sufficient to give a good sense of which techniques work for the type of WSD problems we are facing.",
        "We intend to continue investigating the general applicability of this system for frame disambiguation, including further analysis of our data to better understand the factors that make a disambiguation task more or less difficult for crowd workers.",
        "All the data collected in the course of this study, and the software used to collect and analyze it, will be made available on the FrameNet website."
