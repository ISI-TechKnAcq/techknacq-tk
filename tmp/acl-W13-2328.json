        "and a modality trigger is presented in section 3.",
        "We analyze the interaction between triggers and this specific adverb, focusing on the scope of the adverb and its influence over the modal value of the sentence.",
        "In section 4.1, we briefly summarize the annotation scheme for modality in Portuguese developed by Hendrickx et al. (2012a).",
        "We then demonstrate the implementation of our findings about adverb s?",
        "in this annotation scheme in section 4.2.",
        "We discuss the results of the annotation of a sample of 100 sentences in 4.3 and conclude in section 5.",
        "2 Related work The literature on modality proposes different typologies.",
        "In linguistics, most modal systems are based on the contrast between epistemic and deontic modality.",
        "While the epistemic value is stable across typologies, the other values that are contrasted with it vary considerably.",
        "Some proposals distinguish between epistemic, partici-pant-internal and participant-external modality (Van der Auwera and Plungian, 1998), or between epistemic, speaker-oriented modality and agent-oriented modality (Bybee et al., 1994).",
        "Other values generally considered are, for exam-ple, volition, related to the notions of will, hope and wish; evaluation, concerning the speaker's evaluation of facts and situations; and commis-sives, used by the speaker to express his commitment to make something happen (Palmer, 1986).",
        "Although most of the literature is centered on verbal expressions of modality (mostly semi-auxiliary verbs like may, should, can), studies on adverbs and modality have also been carried out for English (cf. Hoye, 1997).",
        "In the literature on practical corpus annotation of modality, the attention focuses on the distinction between factual and non-factual infor-mation, as many NLP applications need to know what is presented as factual and certain and what is presented as non-factual or probable.",
        "Opposed to the theoretical typologies of modality, these schemes describe in detail which elements in the text are actually involved in the expression of modality and their roles.",
        "These are the subject of the modality (source) and the elements in its scope (target/scope/focus).",
        "Other schemes (Baker et al., 2010; Matsuyoshi et al., 2010; Sauri et al., 2006) also determine the relation between sentences in text, identifying temporal and conditional relations between events or the evaluation of the degree of relevance of some information within a text, rather than classifying modal values.",
        "Rooth (1992) claims that the effects of focus on semantics can be said to be the introduction of a set of alternatives that contrasts with the ordinary semantic meaning of a sentence and that there are lexical items and construction specific-rules that refer directly to the notion of focus.",
        "The phenomenon of focalization is taken to be a grammatical feature that semantically conveys (i) newness/information update; (ii) answering the ?current question?",
        "; (iii) contrast; (iv) invocation of alternatives.",
        "In terms of semantic annotation, Matsuyoshi et al. (2010) propose an annotation scheme for representing extended modality of event mentions in Japanese.",
        "This scheme includes seven components among them the Focus, which represents the focus of negation, inference or interrogative.",
        "There are no works on the annotation of focus and its relation with modality in Portuguese, in any of its variants.",
        "This is an attempt to put the two notions together and propose a scheme that describes the scope of exclusive particles and its impact on the meaning of the expressed modali-ty.",
        "3 Interaction between adverbs and modal value In this section, we discuss in detail the possible interactions between the adverb s?",
        "and modal expressions in the text.",
        "We extracted our examples from the online search platform of the Corpus de Refer?ncia do Portugu's Contempor?neo (CRPC)1, a highly diverse corpus of 312 million words covering a large variety of textual genres and Portuguese varieties (G?n?reux et al., 2012).",
        "The adverb s?",
        "is considered a focus-sensitive particle (Beaver & Clark, 2008; Aloni et al., 1999), defined as a word which semantics ?in-volves essential reference to the information structure of the sentence containing it?",
        "(Aloni et al., 1999:1).",
        "The meaning of only consists of asserting that no proposition from the set of relevant contrasts other than the one expressed is true (von Fintel, 1994).",
        "The standard views on exclusive particles consider that ?the position of focal accent identi",
        "fies the constituent associated with only?",
        "(Dryer, 1994:2).",
        "Dryer (1994) and Schwarzschild (1997), on the other hand, assume that general principles of discourse could explain focus-sensitivity.",
        "Exclusives can also downtone, by underlining the fact that this proposition ?is not the strongest that in principle might have been the case?, a function called Mirative (Beaver & Clark 2008: 250).",
        "Constructions with exclusives involve a positive and a negative component: the positive is called the prejacent and, in sentence (1a), it is equivalent to ?he wants to go home?",
        "; the negative is called the universal and corresponds in (1a) to ?he does not want to do anything else?.",

        "and its target (ir para casa ?to go home?).",
        "The scope of s?",
        "can also be a smaller constituent inside the target.",
        "In (1b), s?",
        "has scope over the by-phrase (por subven?",
        "?o estatal ?by public funding?",
        "), and in (2), over a temporal ad-junct.",
        "The adverb s?",
        "could also occur immediately before the temporal adjunct keeping the same focus reading as in (2) (s?",

        "?The president answered that it should/can only happen after the new courthouse is built.?",
        "Two other possibilities are illustrated in (3) and (4): in (3), the focus is the subject tu ?you?",

        "podem estar 7 jogadores em campo.",
        "?Obviously there can only be 7 players in the field.?",
        "As these examples show, the exclusive particle is not necessarily contiguous to its focus.",
        "The analysis of a sample of the occurrences of the exclusive s?",
        "with a modal trigger in the CRPC corpus shows that in most cases s?",
        "has scope over a specific constituent, rather than over the full target of the modal trigger.",
        "There can be ambiguity in the scope of the exclusive particle s?",
        "in certain contexts.",
        "This is the case when the focus can be interpreted as the full target of the modal trigger or as a specific constituent inside the target.",
        "We illustrate such cases in sentence (5): this sentence can be interpreted as ?the only thing I'm capable of doing is to ask a metaphysical question?",
        "or ?the only question I'm capable of asking is a metaphysical one?.",
        "(5) S?",
        "sou capaz de colocar ao Sr. Ministro uma quest?o metaf?sica.",
        "?I'm only capable of asking a metaphysical question to Mr.",
        "Minister.?",
        "However, in most contexts, there seems to be one preferential interpretation, in spite of the underlying ambiguity.",
        "3.2 From possibility to necessity In contexts where the verb poder has an epistemic reading, the exclusive can restrict the set of possibilities to the one presented in the sentence (x and only x), as illustrated in (6).",
        "(6) Isto s?",
        "pode ter sido um acidente.",
        "?This can only have been an accident?",
        "By restricting the set of possible situations to one, the adverb leads to an overall reading of the sentence as expressing epistemic necessity.",
        "Sen-tence (6) has indeed an equivalent modal meaning to (7) and to a double negative polarity (over the modal verb and over its target), as in (8).",
        "(7) Isto tem deter sido um acidente.",
        "?It had to be an accident?",
        "(8) Isto n?o pode n?o ter sido um acidente.",
        "?It could not not have been an accident?",
        "?The scope of the focus-sensitive particle plays an important role on whether an epistemic trigger may be interpreted as having a necessity reading or not (cf. 3.2).",
        "Contrary to (6), the interpretation of (9) is one of epistemic possibility, although the particle s?",
        "is present.",
        "In this case, the particle has scope over a specific constituent, the tem",
        "poral adjunct, which establishes a condition over the modal trigger.",
        "But in (9b), without the temporal adjunct, the scope of s?",
        "is coincident with the target of the modal trigger and the interpretation is one of necessity, as paraphrased by ?the member of parliament MFL has to be right?.",
        "(9) a. Ora, a Sr.?",
        "Deputada MFL s?",
        "pode ter raz?o quando acertar nalguma previs?o.",
        "?Well, the member of parliament MFL may only be right when at least one of her forecasts turn out correct.?",
        "b. Ora, a Sr.?",
        "Deputada MFL s?",
        "pode ter raz?o.",
        "?Well, the member of parliament MFL can only be right.?",
        "This restriction holds for stative targets, as in (9a), and also for eventive targets, although in this case the possibility or necessity reading is also determined by the tense of the verbal predi-cate.",
        "The necessity reading is only associated to eventive targets temporally located in the past, and is not available, for example, in the sentence ele s?",
        "pode ir ao cinema ?he may only go to the cinema?, where the target is temporally located in the future.",
        "It seems that when the target of the modal trigger is a state or a past event, the exclusive particle leads to a necessity reading instead of a possibility reading, as long as the scope of s?",
        "is the full target of the modal trigger and not a different constituent.",
        "However, we need to assess these factors against more corpus data.",
        "If we compare (6) with a related declarative sentence (cf. isto foi um acidente ?it was an acci-dent?",
        "), we see that the declarative has an assertive value over the situation it denotes, while (6) establishes a set of possibilities and strongly asserts a single one, in what is considered by Moreira (2005) as a case of overmodalization.",
        "The verb dever ?have to?",
        "can occur in contexts similar to (6), as exemplified in (10).",
        "However, the sentence with dever expresses the most probable event and does not entail an epistemic necessity reading, contrary to (6) with verb poder.",
        "(10) Isso s?",
        "deve ter sido um acidente.",
        "?This was probably only an accident?",
        "In (10), the sentence merely states that this is probably what happened.",
        "The fact that the necessity reading does not arise from (10), contrary to (6), follows from the differences that exist between the possibility and the probability reading.",
        "The possibility reading in (6) denotes one particular event out of a set of possible ones and (6) singles out one possibility as the only valid one, affecting the truth-value of the set of alternatives considered.",
        "Sentence (10) denotes that this particular event is more probable to be true than other alternatives.",
        "So, in this sentence the exclusive strengthens the value of this probability but does not establish it as a single one.",
        "It is consequently a scalar use of the exclusive, in the sense that there is an ordering of propositions from weaker to stronger.",
        "3.3 Contexts where s?",
        "is required Contrary to sentences (6), where the adverb s?",
        "can be present or not (with effects on the inter-pretation), in sentences like (11), with the same modal verb, the adverb is required.",

        "?Congressman, you must be kidding!?",
        "These are discursive contexts with a distinctive prosody consisting of a rising tone, marked in writing by the punctuation.",
        "The modal interpretation of (11) is one of epistemic necessity, as in (6).",
        "However, the equivalent sentence without s?",
        "is not acceptable (*Sr. Deputado, pode estar a brincar!",
        "?Congressman, you can be kidding?).",
        "Contrary to (6), the speaker does not consider that a set of possibilities exist, from which one is singled out, but rather takes only into consideration the situation that the sentence denotes (to be kidding) and emphasizes it.",
        "3.4 S?",
        "in ambiguous modal contexts The presence of s?",

      "heading": "3.6 Contrastive value The epistemic subvalues belief and knowledge are expressed by main verbs like achar ?to be-lieve? and saber ?to know?. When the adverb s? occurs in these contexts, it has mainly a discursive function: it establishes a contrast with something that was previously said in the conversation. We exemplify such conversational contexts in (14): (14) A: Eu n?o acho que ele seja corrupto. ?I don't think he is corrupted? B: Eu s? sei que ele fez grandes dep?sitos em offshores. ?I only know that he made big deposits in offshores? The different contexts discussed in this section show that the interpretation of s? with modal trigger is complex and varies according to the lexical trigger and its value, but also to the linguistic context and to pragmatic factors. 4 Corpus Annotation In this section, we first report on the annotation scheme previously implemented for Portuguese, in 4.1. We then discuss how to integrate our findings regarding the adverb s? ?only?, in 4.2, and report on the results of the annotation of a sample corpus in 4.3. 4.1 Annotation scheme for Portuguese The annotation scheme for Portuguese presented in Hendrickx et al. (2012a) follow a theoretical-ly-oriented perspective, but also addresses certain modal values that are important for practical applications in Information Extraction. The annotation is not restricted to modal verbs and instead covers several parts of speech with modal value: nouns, adjectives and adverbs. Tense, however, is not included, although it has an important part in the modal interpretation of sentences. Also, only modal events are annotated, not entities. The approach is very similar to the approach taken in the OntoSem (Mcshane et al.,",
      "text": [
        "2005) annotation scheme for modality (Niren-burg and McShane, 2008).",
        "Seven main modal values are considered (ep-istemic, deontic, participant-internal, volition, evaluation, effort and success), and several sub values, based on the modality litterature, but also on studies focused on corpus annotation and information extraction (e.g. (Palmer, 1986; van der Auwera and Plungian, 1998; Baker et al., 2010)).",
        "There are five sub-values for epistemic modality: knowledge, belief, doubt, possibility and inter-rogative.",
        "Contexts traditionally considered of the modal type ?evidentials?",
        "(i.e, supported by evi-dence) are annotated as epistemic belief.",
        "Two subvalues are identified for deontic modality: deontic obligation and deontic permission (this includes what is sometimes considered partici-pant-external modality, as in van der Auwera and Plungian (1998)).",
        "Participant-internal modality is subdivided into necessity and capacity.",
        "Four other values are included: evaluation, volition and, following Baker et al. (2010), effort and success.",
        "The annotation scheme comprises several components to be tagged: (a) the trigger, i.e, the lexical element conveying the modal value ?",
        "we choose to tag the smallest possible unit (noun, verb, etc.",
        "); (b) the target, expressed typically by a clause and tagged maximally to include all relevant parts; (c) the source of the event mention (speaker or writer) and (d) the source of the modality (agent or experiencer), to distinguish between the person who is producing the sentence with modal value and the person who is 'under-going' the modality.",
        "The trigger receives two attributes: Modal value (selection out of 13 possible values); and Polarity (positive or negative).",
        "The polarity attribute regards the value of the trigger and not of the full sentence.",
        "This scheme has been applied to the manual annotation of a corpus sample of approximately 2000 sentences using the MMAX2 annotation software tool2 (M?ller and Strube, 2006).",

        "The focus particle does not typically have scope over the modal trigger, but rather over other components of the modal scheme (like the target or the source of modali-ty).",
        "However, we decided to mark focus information in the trigger component, inspired by the approach of Miwa et al. (2012), since we are considering it as the main element that subsumes the total information regarding the modal event.",

        "was added to the modal scheme to identify the focus-sensitive particle in the text.",

        "All ambiguous cases regarding modal value involve the verb poder ?can/may?, which can denote readings of deontic permission, epistemic possibility and participant-internal capacity.",
        "The other four modal verbs are never marked as having more than one modal reading in the context.",
        "The most frequent ambiguity in this sample involves the two modal values: epistemic possibility and deontic permission.",
        "In three cases, the annotator marked the trigger as having a deontic permission reading, and considered it ambiguous (ambiguity feature of the trigger) with an epistemic possibility value.",
        "In two other contexts, the opposite choice was made: epistemic possibility was the marked value and deontic permission was annotated as a possible alternative value.",
        "The other four cases of modal ambiguity involve epistemic possibility and participant-internal ca-pacity: in two cases, the former was selected as the most salient value, while the opposite choice was made in the other two cases.",
        "The most frequent constituents in the scope of the exclusive in our annotation are temporal ad-juncts, with a total of 27 cases.",
        "The verb dever stands out, with 14 occurrences, out of the total of 27.",
        "The second most frequent type of focus (freq.",
        "23) corresponds to cases where the exclusive has scope over the whole target of the modal trigger.",
        "The two most frequent verbs with this type of focus are querer and ter de (in fact, all but two occurrences of querer are of this kind).",
        "The two most paradigmatic modal verbs, poder and dever, never occur with the whole target as focus, but rather favour cases where s?",
        "has scope over different constituents of the sentence.",
        "There is a large set of possible constituents which receive the focus of the exclusives: subjects (7), objects (9), quantifiers (5), predicative adjectives (1), by-phrases in passive constructions (3), temporal adjuncts (27), locative adjuncts (1), conditional clauses (5), prepositional phrases (7), and adverbial phrases (3).",
        "While dever shows a preference for the construction with a temporal ad-junct, the verb poder presents low frequencies of a large set of these possibilities.",
        "There are 5 cases of ambiguity in the scope of the focus particle, 2 with ter de ?have to?, 2 with ser capaz de ?to be able to?",
        "and one with poder ?can?.",
        "This is perhaps a surprisingly low number compared to our comments in subsection 3.1.",
        "Although focus scope is potentially extremely ambiguous, it turns out that the linguistic context seems to lead to one specific interpretation regarding the constituent under focus.",
        "In the 5 ambiguous cases, the scope of the focus particle can be understood as a specific constituent included in the target of the modal trigger, or it can be the whole event denoted by the target.",
        "The interpretation of the exclusive and the verb poder as a case of epistemic necessity occurs a single time in our annotation, with a sta-tive target in the future tense.",
        "No case of contrastive value (cf. (14)) was encountered, but this is certainly due to the fact that we annotated single sentences out of context, and also to the fact that we didn't select knowledge verbs, which typically allow this value.",
        "Also, no case of",
        "non-optional exclusive particle was found in our set of sentences.",
        "We did, however, identify 7 contexts with ter de and 3 contexts with querer, which denote a weaker alternative than expected and were marked with the value ?mirative?.",
        "Overall, the proposed solution for handling the complex annotation of the interaction between exclusive particles and modality captured all cases we encountered in our small sample of 100 sentences.",
        "However, the annotation of more data is required to evaluate if our modal scheme can deal with the discursive values assumed by the exclusive in certain contexts.",
        "Two different human annotators performed the annotation of a subset of 50 sentences with s?",
        "independently.",
        "We conducted a small study to measure the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for this annotation task.",
        "Such a study gives us information about the feasibility of the annotation scheme and about the level of detail of our guidelines.",
        "We computed IAA using the kappa-statistic (Cohen, 1960) for each field in the anno-tation3.",
        "The trigger achieved a kappa value of 0.85, while the modal value attained a value of 0.83.",
        "Although the task involved a higher level of complexity due to the annotation of both modal and focus information, the results are in line with the ones reported in Hendrickx et al. (2012b) and, for English, in Matsuyoshi et al. (2010).",
        "We also measured the kappa value for the target component, which attained 0.64.",
        "For the focus scope an inter-annotator agreement of 0.63 is achieved.",
        "These are lower scores than the ones achieved for trigger and modal value, which is due to small differences in the delimitation of the constituents between the two annotators (for example, the inclusion or not of an adjunct).",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a detailed analysis of the interaction between the exclusive s?",
        "and modal expressions occurring in texts.",
        "As Portner puts it ?It seems that modality is not something that one simply observes, but rather something that one discovers, perhaps only after careful work.?",
        "(Portner, 2009:1) and this is what we have attempted in this study.",
        "We presented the extension of a modality scheme developed for Portuguese to account for focus-sensitive particles in modal contexts and our experience in annotating a sample of 100 sentences with this extended scheme.",
        "Data show 3 Note that we are very strict in the computation, only full string matches are counted as agreement.",
        "that this is a complex issue that needs to consider the modal value, the linguistic context and each modal trigger.",
        "The annotation confirms the dual nature of exclusives, due to the fact that in certain contexts they both signal one of the possible alternatives and describe it as weaker that would be expected by the participants.",
        "The scope of the focus particle plays an important role in the meaning of the sentence since it adds a condition to the modal value and can affect the global meaning of the sentence.",
        "Discursive aspects have also to be taken into consideration and evaluated against our annotation scheme.",
        "As a next step we aim to study a context larger than the sentence for the annotation of the interaction between modals and exclusives.",
        "We plan to proceed with the analysis of the interaction of s?",
        "in a larger number of modal contexts and also to enlarge the analysis to other adverbs of the same type, like apenas and unicamente.",
        "Another objective is to explore the combined effects of polarity, modality and this type of adverbs, and to later contrast the results with other Romance languages, as well as English.",
