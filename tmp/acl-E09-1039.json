        "Can one identify a person from samples of his/her communication?",
        "What common patterns of communication can be used to identify people?",
        "Are such patterns consistent across varying genres?",
        "People tend to be interested in subjects and topics that they discuss with friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances.",
        "They can communicate with these people textually via email, text messages and chat rooms.",
        "They can also communicate via verbal conversations.",
        "Other forms of communication could include blogs or even formal writings such as essays or scientific articles.",
        "People communicating in these different \"genres\" may have different stylistic patterns and we are interested in whether or not we could identify people from their communications in different genres.",
        "The attempt to identify authorship of written text has a long history that predates electronic computing.",
        "The idea that features such as average word length and average sentence length could allow an author to be identified dates to Mendenhall (1887).",
        "Mosteller and Wallace (1964) used function words in a groundbreaking study that identified authors of The Federalist Papers.",
        "Since then many attempts at authorship attribution have used function words and other features, such as word class frequencies and measures derived from syntactic analysis, often combined using multivariable statistical techniques.",
        "Recently, McCarthy (2006) was able to differentiate three authors' works, and Hill and Provost (2003), using a feature of co-citations, showed that they could successfully identify scientific articles by the same person, achieving 85% accuracy when the person has authored over 100 papers.",
        "Levitan and Argamon (2006) and McCombe (2002) further investigated authorship identification of The Federalist Papers (three authors).",
        "The genre of the text may affect the authorship identification task.",
        "The attempt to characterize genres dates to Biber (1988) who selected 67 linguistic features and analyzed samples of 23 spoken and written genres.",
        "He determined six factors that could be used to identify written text.",
        "Since his study, new \"cybergenres\" have evolved, including email, blogs, chat, and text messaging.",
        "Efforts have been made to characterize the linguistic features of these genres (Baron, 2003; Crystal, 2001; Herring, 2001; Shepherd and Watters, 1999; Yates, 1996).",
        "The task is complicated by the great diversity that can be exhibited within even a single genre.",
        "Email can be business-related, personal, or spam; the style can be tremendously affected by demographic factors, including gender and age of the sender.",
        "The context of communication influences language style (Thomson and Murachver, 2001; Coupland, et al., 1988).",
        "Some people use abbreviations to ease the efficiency of communication in informal genres - items that one would not find in a formal essay.",
        "Informal writing may also contain emoticons (e.g., \":-)\" or \"Â©\") to convey mood.",
        "Successes have been achieved in categorizing web page decriptions (Calvo, et al., 2004) and genre determination (Goldstein-Stewart, et al., 2007; Santini 2007).",
        "Genders of authors have been successfully identified within the British National Corpus (Koppel, et al., 2002).",
        "In authorship identification, recent research has focused on identifying authors within a particular genre: email collections, news stories, scientific papers, listserv forums, and computer programs (de Vel, et al., 2001; Krsul and Spafford, 1997; Madigan, et al., 2005; McCombe, 2002).",
        "In the KDD Cup 2003 Competitive Task, systems attempted to identify successfully scientific articles authored by the same person.",
        "The best system (Hill and Provost, 2003) was able to identify successfully scientific articles by the same person 45% of the time; for authors with over 100 papers, 85% accuracy was achieved.",
        "Are there common features of communication of an individual across and within genres?",
        "Undoubtedly, the lack of corpora has been an impediment to answering this question, as gathering personal communication samples faces considerable privacy and accessibility hurdles.",
        "To our knowledge, all previous studies have focused on individual communications in one or possibly two genres.",
        "To analyze, compare, and contrast the communication of individuals across and within different modalities, we collected a corpus consisting of communication samples of 21 people in six genres on six topics.",
        "We believe this corpus is the first attempt to create such a correlated corpus.",
        "From this corpus, we are able to perform experiments on person identification.",
        "Specifically, this means recognizing which individual of a set of people composed a document or spoke an utterance which was transcribed.",
        "We believe using text and transcribed speech in this manner is a novel research area.",
        "In particular, the following types of experiments can be performed:",
        "- Identification of person in a novel genre (using five genres as training)",
        "- Identification of person in a novel topic (using five topics as training)",
        "- Identification of person in written genres, after training on the two spoken genres",
        "- Identification of person in spoken genres, after training on the written genres",
        "- Identification of person in written genres, after training on the other written genres",
        "In this paper, we discuss the formation and statistics of this corpus and report results for identifying individual people using techniques that utilize several different feature sets."

        "Table 9 shows that overall the L+S feature set performed better than either the L+F or L+F+T sets.",
        "The most noticeable differences are the drops in the accuracy when the five topic words are added, particularly on the topics of marijuana and privacy rights.",
        "For L+F+T, if \"marijuana\" is withheld from the topic word features when the marijuana topic is the test set, the accuracy rises to 90%.",

        "The best score was 29% for essays.",
        "5.6 Predict Authorship in a Textual Genre Given Information on Other Textual Genres",
        "Table 12 shows the results of training on text data only and predicting authorship for one of the four text genres.",
        "Recognizing the authors in chat is the most difficult, which is not surprising since the blogs, essays and emails are more similar to each other than the chat genre, which uses abbreviations and more informal language as well as being immediately interactive.",
        "5.7 Predict Communicant in a Speech Genre Given Information on Textual Genres",
        "Training on text and classifying speech-based samples by author showed poor results.",
        "Similar to the results for speech genres, using the text genres alone to determine the individual in the speech genre results in a maximum score of 29% for the interview genre (Table 13).",

        "Person identification accuracy (%) training SMO on textual genres and testing on speech genres",
        "Results for different training and test sets vary considerably.",
        "A key factor in determining which sets can successfully be used to train other sets seems to be the mode, that is, whether or not a set is textual or spoken, as the lowest accuracies tend to be found between genres of different modes.",
        "This suggests that how people write and how they speak may be somewhat distinct.",
        "Typically, more data samples in the training tends to increase the accuracy of the tests, but more features does not guarantee the same result.",
        "An examination of the feature sets revealed further explanations for this apart from any inherent difficulties in recognizing authors between sets.",
        "For many tests, there is a tendency for the same person to be chosen for classification, indicating a bias to that person in the training data.",
        "This is typically caused by features that have mostly, but not all, zero values in training samples, but have many non-zero values in testing.",
        "The most striking examples of this are described in 5.3, where the removal of certain topic-related features was found to dramatically increase the accruacy.",
        "Targetted removal of other features that have the same biasing effect could increase accuracy.",
        "While Weka normalizes the incoming features for SMO, it was also discovered that a simple initial normalization of the feature sets by dividing by the maximum or standardization by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the feature sets could increase the accuracy across the different tests."
