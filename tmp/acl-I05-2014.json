        "Although it is claimed that such objective MT evaluation methods are language-independent, they are usually only applied to English, as they basically rely on word counts.",
        "In fact, the organisers of campaigns like NIST (PRZYBOCKI, 2004)1, TIDES2 or IWSLT (AKIBA et al., 2004)3, prefer to evaluate outputs of machine translation systems which are already segmented into words before applying such objective evaluation methods.",
        "The consequence of this state of affairs is that evaluation campaigns of English to Japanese or English to Chinese machine translation systems for instance, are not, to our knowledge, widely seen or reported."

        "As statistical machine translation systems basically rely on the notion of words through their lexicon models (BROWN et al., 1993), they are usually capable of outputting sentences already segmented into words when they translate into languages like Chinese or Japanese.",
        "But this is not necessarily the case with commercial systems.",
        "For instance, Systran4 does not output segmented texts when it translates into Chinese or Japanese.",
        "As such, comparing systems that translate into languages where words are not an immediate given in unprocessed texts, is still hindered by the human evaluation bottleneck.",
        "To compare the performance of different systems, segmentation has to be performed beforehand.",
        "One can always apply standard word segmentation tools (for instance, The Peking University Segmenter for Chinese (DUAN et al., 2003) or ChaSen for Japanese (MATSUMOTO et al., 1999)), and then apply objective MT evaluation methods.",
        "However, the scores obtained would be biased by the error rates of the segmentation tools on MT outputs5.",
        "Indeed, MT outputs still differ from standard texts, and their segmentation may lead to a different performance.",
        "Consequently, it is difficult to directly and fairly compare scores obtained for a system outputting non-segmented sentences with scores obtained for a system delivering sentences already segmented into words."

        "Although far from being perfect, they definitely are automatic, fast, and cheap.",
        "For all these reasons, one cannot easily ask the MT community to give up their practical know-how related to such measures.",

        "Intuitively a high correlation should exist.",
