        "(2009) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "However, these approaches dictate a particular choice of model and training regime.",
        "It can be tricky and time-consuming to adapt an existing supervised NLP system to use these semi-supervised techniques.",
        "It is preferable to use a simple and general method to adapt existing supervised NLP systems to be semi-supervised.",
        "One approach that is becoming popular is to use unsupervised methods to induce word features – or to download word features that have already been induced – plug these word features into an existing system, and observe a significant increase in accuracy.",
        "But which word features are good for what tasks?",
        "Should we prefer certain word features?",
        "Can we combine them?",
        "A word representation is a mathematical object associated with each word, often a vector.",
        "Each dimension's value corresponds to a feature and might even have a semantic or grammatical interpretation, so we call it a word feature.",
        "Conventionally, supervised lexicalized NLP approaches take a word and convert it to a symbolic ID, which is then transformed into a feature vector using a one-hot representation: The feature vector has the same length as the size of the vocabulary, and only one dimension is on.",
        "However, the one-hot representation of a word suffers from data sparsity: Namely, for words that are rare in the labeled training data, their corresponding model parameters will be poorly estimated.",
        "Moreover, at test time, the model cannot handle words that do not appear in the labeled training data.",
        "These limitations of one-hot word representations have prompted researchers to investigate unsupervised methods for inducing word representations over large unlabeled corpora.",
        "Word features can be hand-designed, but our goal is to learn them.",
        "One common approach to inducing unsupervised word representation is to use clustering, perhaps hierarchical.",
        "This technique was used by a variety of researchers (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Koo et al., 2008; Ratinov & Roth, 2009; Huang & Yates, 2009).",

        "As far as we know, ICA methods have not been used when the size of the vocab W is 100K or more.",
        "Explicitly storing cooccurrence matrix F can be memory-intensive, and transforming F to f can be time-consuming.",
        "It is preferable that F never be computed explicitly, and that fbe constructed incrementally.",

        "This is similar in magnitude to our experiments.",
        "Another incremental approach to constructing f is using a random projection: Linear mapping g is multiplying F by a random matrix chosen a priori.",
        "This random indexing method is motivated by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which states that for certain choices of random matrix, if d is sufficiently large, then the original distances between words in F will be preserved in f(Sahlgren, 2005).",
