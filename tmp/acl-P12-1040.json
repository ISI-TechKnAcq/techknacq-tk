        "Coreference resolution, the task of clustering mentions into partitions representing their underlying real-world entities, is fundamental for high-level information extraction and data integration, including semantic search, question answering, and knowledge base construction.",
        "For example, coreference is vital for determining author publication lists in bibliographic knowledge bases such as CiteSeer and Google Scholar, where the repository must know if the ?R.",
        "Hamming?",
        "who authored ?Error detecting and error correcting codes?",
        "is the same?",
        "?R.",
        "Hamming?",
        "who authored ?The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.?",
        "Features of the mentions (e.g., bags-of-words in titles, contextual snippets and co-author lists) provide evidence for resolving such entities.",
        "Over the years, various machine learning techniques have been applied to different variations of the coreference problem.",
        "A commonality in many of these approaches is that they model the problem of entity coreference as a collection of decisions between mention pairs (Bagga and Baldwin, 1999; Soon et al., 2001; McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Singla and Domingos, 2005; Bengston and Roth, 2008).",
        "That is, coreference is solved by answering a quadratic number of questions of the form ?does mention A refer to the same entity as mention B??",
        "with a compatibility function that indicates how likely A and B are coreferent.",
        "While these models have been successful in some domains, they also exhibit several undesirable characteristics.",
        "The first is that pairwise models lack the expressivity required to represent aggregate properties of the entities.",
        "Recent work has shown that these entity-level properties allow systems to correct coreference errors made from myopic pairwise decisions (Ng, 2005; Culotta et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Wick et al., 2009), and can even provide a strong signal for unsupervised coreference (Bhat-tacharya and Getoor, 2006; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).",
        "A second problem, that has received significantly less attention in the literature, is that the pairwise coreference models scale poorly to large collections of mentions especially when the expected",
        "summarize subtrees.",
        "Pairwise factors (black squares) measure compatibilities between child and parent nodes, avoiding quadratic blow-up.",
        "Corresponding decision variables (open circles) indicate whether one node is the child of another.",
        "Mentions (gray boxes) are leaves.",
        "Deciding whether to merge these two entities requires evaluating just a single factor (red square), corresponding to the new child-parent relationship.",
        "number of mentions in each entity cluster is also large.",
        "Current systems cope with this by either dividing the data into blocks to reduce the search space (Herna?ndez and Stolfo, 1995; McCallum et al., 2000; Bilenko et al., 2006), using fixed heuristics to greedily compress the mentions (Ravin and Kazi, 1999; Rao et al., 2010), employing specialized Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures (Milch et al., 2006; Richardson and Domingos, 2006; Singh et al., 2010), or introducing shallow hierarchies of sub-entities for MCMC block moves and super-entities for adaptive distributed inference (Singh et al., 2011).",
        "However, while these methods help manage the search space for medium-scale data, evaluating each coreference decision in many of these systems still scales linearly with the number of mentions in an entity, resulting in prohibitive computational costs associated with large datasets.",
        "This scaling with the number of mentions per entity seems particularly wasteful because although it is common for an entity to be referenced by a large number of mentions, many of these coreferent mentions are highly similar to each other.",
        "For example, in author coreference the two most common strings that refer to Richard Hamming might have the form ?R.",
        "Hamming?",
        "and ?Richard Hamming.?",
        "In newswire coreference, a prominent entity like Barack Obama may have millions of ?Obama?",
        "mentions (many occurring in similar semantic contexts).",
        "Deciding whether a mention belongs to this entity need not involve comparisons to all contextually similar ?Obama?",
        "mentions; rather we prefer a more compact representation in order to efficiently reason about them.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical discriminative factor graph for coreference resolution that recursively structures each entity as a tree of latent sub-entities with mentions at the leaves.",
        "Our hierarchical model avoids the aforementioned problems of the pairwise approach: not only can it jointly reason about attributes of entire entities (using the power of discriminative conditional random fields), but it is also able to scale to datasets with enormous numbers of mentions because scoring entities does not require computing a quadratic number of compatibility functions.",
        "The key insight is that each node in the tree functions as a highly compact information-rich summary of its children.",
        "Thus, a small handful of upper-level nodes may summarize millions of mentions (for example, a single node may summarize all contextually similar ?R.",
        "Hamming?",
        "mentions).",
        "Although inferring the structure of the entities requires reasoning over a larger state-space, the latent trees are actually beneficial to inference (as shown for shallow trees in Singh et al.",
        "(2011)), resulting in rapid progress toward high probability regions, and mirroring known benefits of auxiliary variable methods in statistical physics (such as Swendsen and Wang (1987)).",
        "Moreover,",
        "each step of inference is computationally efficient because evaluating the cost of attaching (or detaching) sub-trees requires computing just a single compatibility function (as seen in Figure 1).",
        "Further, our hierarchical approach provides a number of additional advantages.",
        "First, the recursive nature of the tree (arbitrary depth and width) allows the model to adapt to different types of data and effectively compress entities of different scales (e.g., entities with more mentions may require a deeper hierarchy to compress).",
        "Second, the model contains compatibility functions at all levels of the tree enabling it to simultaneously reason at multiple granularities of entity compression.",
        "Third, the trees can provide split points for finer-grained entities by placing contextually similar mentions under the same subtree.",
        "Finally, if memory is limited, redundant mentions can be pruned by replacing subtrees with their roots.",
        "Empirically, we demonstrate that our model is several orders of magnitude faster than a pairwise model, allowing us to perform efficient coreference on nearly six million author mentions in under four hours using a single CPU."
