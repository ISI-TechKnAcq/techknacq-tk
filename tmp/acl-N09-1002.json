        "Automatic extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text (subjectivity analysis) to support applications such as product review mining, summarization, question answering, and information extraction is an active area of research in NLP.",
        "Many approaches to opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity analysis rely on lexicons of words that may be used to express subjectivity.",
        "However, words may have both subjective and objective senses, which is a source of ambiguity in subjectivity and sentiment analysis.",
        "We show that even words judged in previous work to be reliable clues of subjectivity have significant degrees of subjectivity sense ambiguity.",
        "To address this ambiguity, we present a method for automatically assigning subjectivity labels to word senses in a taxonomy, which uses new features and integrates more diverse types of knowledge than in previous work.",
        "We focus on nouns, which are challenging and have received less attention in automatic subjectivity and sentiment analysis.",
        "A common approach to building lexicons for subjectivity analysis is to begin with a small set of seeds which are prototypically subjective (or positive/negative, in sentiment analysis), and then follow semantic links in WordNet-like resources.",
        "By far, the emphasis has been on horizontal relations, such as synonymy and antonymy.",
        "Exploiting vertical links opens the door to taking into account the information content of ancestor concepts of senses with known and unknown subjectivity.",
        "We develop novel features that measure the similarity of a target word sense with a seed set of senses known to be subjective, where the similarity between two concepts is determined by the extent to which they share information, measured by the information content associated with their least common subsumer (LCS).",
        "Further, particularizing the LCS features to domain greatly reduces calculation while still maintaining effective features.",
        "We find that our new features do lead to significant improvements over methods proposed in previous work, and that the combination of all features gives significantly better performance than any single type of feature alone.",
        "We also ask, given that there are many approaches to finding subjective words, if it would make sense for word-and sense-level approaches to work in tandem, or should we best view them as competing approaches?",
        "We give evidence suggesting that first identifying subjective words and then disambiguating their senses would be an effective approach to subjectivity sense labeling.",
        "There are several motivations for assigning subjectivity labels to senses.",
        "First, (Wiebe and Mi-halcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation.",
        "Similarly, given subjectivity sense labels, word-sense disambiguation may potentially help contextual subjectivity analysis.",
        "In addition, as lexical resources such as WordNet are developed further, subjectivity labels would provide principled criteria for refining word senses, as well as for clustering similar meanings to create more course-grained sense inventories.",
        "For many opinion mining applications, polarity (positive, negative) is also important.",
        "The overall framework we envision is a layered approach: classifying instances as objective or subjective, and further classifying the subjective instances by polarity.",
        "Decomposing the problem into subproblems has been found to be effective for opinion mining.",
        "This paper addresses the first of these subproblems."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM).",
        "Subjective expressions are words and phrases being used to express opinions, emotions, speculations, etc.",
        "WM give the following examples:",
        "His alarm grew.",
        "He absorbed the information quickly.",
        "UCC/Disciples leaders roundly condemned the Iranian President's verbal assault on Israel.",
        "What's the catch?",
        "Polarity (also called semantic orientation) is also important to NLP applications in sentiment analysis and opinion extraction.",
        "In review mining, for example, we want to know whether an opinion about a product is positive or negative.",
        "Even so, we believe there are strong motivations for a separate subjective/objective (S/O) classification as well.",
        "First, expressions may be subjective but not have any particular polarity.",
        "An example given by (Wilson et al., 2005) is Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states.",
        "An NLP application system may want to find a wide range of private states attributed to a person, such as their motivations, thoughts, and speculations, in addition to their positive and negative sentiments.",
        "Second, distinguishing S and O instances has often proven more difficult than subsequent polarity classification.",
        "Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a).",
        "Thus, effective methods for S/O classification promise to improve performance for sentiment classification.",
        "In fact, researchers in sentiment analysis have realized benefits by decomposing the problem into S/O and polarity classification (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006).",
        "One reason is that different features may be relevant for the two subproblems.",
        "For example, negation features are more important for polarity classification than for subjectivity classification.",
        "Note that some of our features require vertical links that are present in WordNet for nouns and verbs but not for other parts of speech.",
        "Thus we address nouns (leaving verbs to future work).",
        "There are other motivations for focusing on nouns.",
        "Relatively little work in subjectivity and sentiment analysis has focused on subjective nouns.",
        "Also, a study (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999) showed that, of the major parts of speech, nouns are the most ambiguous with respect to the subjectivity of their instances.",
        "Turning to word senses, we adopt the definitions from WM.",
        "First, subjective: \"Classifying a sense as S means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, we expect it to express subjectivity; we also expect the phrase or sentence containing it to be subjective [WM, pp.",
        "2-3].\"",
        "In WM, it is noted that sentences containing objective senses may not be objective, as in the sentence Will someone shut that darn alarm off?",
        "Thus, objective senses are defined as follows: \"Classifying a sense as O means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, we do not expect it to express subjectivity and, if the phrase or sentence containing it is subjective, the subjectivity is due to something",
        "The following subjective examples are given in",
        "His alarm grew.",
        "alarm, dismay, consternation - (fear resulting from the awareness of danger) => fear, fearfulness, fright - (an emotion experienced in anticipation of some specific pain or danger (usually accompanied by a desire to flee or fight))",
        "What's the catch?",
        "catch - (a hidden drawback; \"it sounds good but what's the catch?\")",
        "=> drawback - (the quality of being a hindrance; \"he pointed out all the drawbacks to my plan\")",
        "The following objective examples are given in WM:",
        "The alarm went off.",
        "alarm, warning device, alarm system - (a device that signals the occurrence of some undesirable event) => device - (an instrumentality invented for a particular purpose; \"the device is small enough to wear on your wrist\"; \"a device intended to conserve water\")",
        "He sold his catch at the market.",
        "catch, haul - (the quantity that was caught; \"the catch was only 10 fish\") => indefinite quantity - (an estimated quantity)",
        "WM performed an agreement study and report that good agreement (k=0.74) can be achieved between human annotators labeling the subjectivity of senses.",
        "For a similar task, (Su and Markert, 2008) also report good agreement."

        "WM use an unsupervised corpus-based approach, in which subjectivity labels are assigned to word senses based on a set of distributionally similar words in a corpus annotated with subjective expressions.",
        "SM explore methods that use existing resources that do not require manually annotated data; they also implement a supervised system for comparison, which we will call SMsup.",

        "Like ES and SMsup, we use machine learning, but with more diverse sources of knowledge.",
        "Further, several of our features are novel for the task.",
        "The LCS features (Section 6.1) detect subjectivity by measuring the similarity of a candidate word sense with a seed set.",
        "WM also use a similarity measure, but as a way to filter the output of a measure of distributional similarity (selecting words for a given word sense), not as we do to cumulatively calculate the subjectivity of a word sense.",
        "Another novel aspect of our similarity features is that they are particularized to domain, which greatly reduces calculation.",
        "The domain subjectivity LCS features (Section 6.2) are also novel for our task.",
        "So is augmenting seed sets with monosemous words, for greater coverage without requiring human intervention or sacrificing quality.",

        "After sorting our subjective seed set into different domains, we observed that over 80% of the subjective seed senses are concentrated in six domains (the rest are distributed among 35 domains).",
        "Thus, we decided to particularize the semantic similarity feature to domain, such that only the subset of the seed set in the same domain as the target sense is used to compute the feature.",

        "In this section, we seek to gain insights by performing ablation studies, evaluating our method on different data compositions, and comparing our results to previous results.",
        "Since there are several features, we divided them into sets for the ablation studies.",
        "The vector-of-gloss-words features are the most similar to ones used in previous work.",
        "Thus, we opted to treat them as one ablation group (Gloss vector).",
        "The Overlaps group includes the RelOverlap(t, SS), RelOverlap(t, OS), GlOverlap(t, SS), and GlOverlap(t, OS) features.",
        "Finally, the LCS group includes the SenseLCSscore and the DomainLCSscore features.",

        "In the irst, one group of features at a time is included.",

        "Several methods have been developed for identifying subjective words.",
        "Perhaps an effective strategy would be to begin with a word-level subjectivity lexicon, and then perform subjectivity sense labeling to sort the subjective from objective senses of those words.",
        "We also wondered about the relative effectiveness of our method on strongsubj versus weak-subj clues.",
        "To answer these questions, we apply the full model (again in 10-fold cross validation experiments) to data sets composed of senses of polyse-mous words in the subjectivity lexicon.",
        "To support comparison, all of the data sets in this section have a 50%-50% objective/subjective distribution.",

        "We see that the results on this corpus are better than on the mixed data set, even though the baseline accuracy is lower and the corpus is smaller.",
        "This supports the idea that an effective strategy would be to irst identify opinion-bearing words, and then apply our method to those words to sort out their subjective and objective senses.",
        "The third row shows results for a weaksubjsubset of the strong+weak corpus and the fourth shows results for a strongsubj subset that is of the same size.",

        "In this paper, we introduced an integrative approach to automatic subjectivity word sense labeling which combines features exploiting the hierarchical structure and domain information of WordNet, as well as similarity of glosses and overlap among sets of semantically related words.",
        "There are several contributions.",
        "First, we learn several things.",
        "We found (in Section 4) that even reliable lists of subjective (opinion-bearing) words have many objective senses.",
        "We asked if word-and sense-level approaches could be used effectively in tandem, and found (in Section 7.3) that an effective strategy is to irst identify opinion-bearing words, and then apply our method to sort out their subjective and objective senses.",
        "We also found (in Section 7.2) that the entire set of features gives better results than any individual type of feature alone.",
        "Second, several of the features are novel for our task, including those exploiting the hierarchical structure of a lexical resource, domain information, and relations to seed sets expanded with monose-mous senses.",
        "Finally, the combination of our particular features is effective.",
        "For example, on senses of words from a subjectivity lexicon, accuracies range from 20 to 29 percentage points above baseline.",
        "Further, our combination of features outperforms previous approaches."
