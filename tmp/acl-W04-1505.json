        "We present a fast, deep-linguistic statistical parser that profits from DG characteristics and that uses am minimal parsing strategy.",
        "First, we rely on finite-state based approaches as long as possible, secondly where parsing is necessary we keep it context-free as long as possible1.",
        "For low-level syntactic tasks, tagging and base-NP chunking is used, parsing only takes place between heads of chunks.",
        "Robust, successful parsers (Abney, 1995; Collins, 1999) have shown that this division of labour is particularly attractive for DG.",
        "Deep-linguistic, Formal Grammar parsers have carefully crafted grammars written by professional linguists.",
        "But unrestricted real-world texts still pose a problem to NLP systems that are based on Formal Grammars.",
        "Few hand-crafted, deep linguistic grammars achieve the coverage and robustness needed to parse large corpora (see (Riezler et al., 2002), (Burke et al., 2004) and (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002) for exceptions), and speed remains a serious challenge.",
        "The typical problems can be grouped as follows.",
        "Grammar complexity Fully comprehensive grammars are difficult to maintain and consid-'Non-subject WH-question pronouns and support verbs cannot be treated context-free with our approach.",
        "We use a simple pre-parsing step to analyze them erably increase parsing complexity.",
        "Parsing complexity Typical formal grammar parser complexity is much higher than the O(n3) for CFG.",
        "The complexity of some formal grammars is still unknown.2 Parsing algorithms able to treat completely unrestricted long-distance dependencies are NP-complete (Neuhaus and Broker, 1997).",
        "Ranking Returning all syntactically possible analyses for a sentence is not what is expected of a syntactic analyzer.",
        "A clear indication of preference is needed.",
        "Pruning In order to keep search spaces manageable it is necessary to discard unconvincing alternatives already during the parsing process.",
        "A number of robust statistical parsers that offer solutions to these problems have become available (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999; Henderson, 2003).",
        "In a statistical parser, the ranking of intermediate structures occurs naturally and based on empirical grounds, while most rule-based systems rely on ad hoc heuristics.",
        "With an aggressive beam for parse-time pruning (so in our parser), real-world parsing time can be reduced to near-linear.",
        "If one were to assume a constantly full fixed beam, or uses an oracle (Nivre, 2004) it is linear in practice3.",
        "Also worst-case complexity for exhaustive parsing is low, as these parsers are CFG-based (Eisner, 2000)4.",
        "But they typically produce CFG constituency data as output, trees that do not express long-distance dependencies.",
        "Although grammatical function and empty",
        "nodes annotation expressing long-distance dependencies are provided in Treebanks such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), most statistical Treebank trained parsers fully or largely ignore them5, which entails two problems: first, the training cannot profit from valuable annotation data.",
        "Second, the extraction of long-distance dependencies (LDD) and the mapping to shallow semantic representations is not always possible from the output of these parsers.",
        "This limitation is aggravated by a lack of co-indexation information and parsing errors across an LDD.",
        "In fact, some syntactic relations cannot be recovered on configurational grounds only.",
        "For these reasons, (Johnson, 2002) refers to them as \"half-grammars\".",
        "An approach that relies heavily on DG characteristics is explored in this paper.",
        "It uses a handwritten DG grammar and a lexicalized probability model.",
        "It combines the low complexity of a CFG parser, the pruning and ranking advantages of statistical parsers and the ability to express the majority of LDDs of Formal Grammars.",
        "After presenting the DG benefits, we define our DG and introduce our statistical model.",
        "Then, we give an evaluation.",
        "2 The Benefit of DG Characteristics In addition to some obvious benefits, such as the integration of chunking and parsing (Abney, 1995), where a chunk largely corresponds to a nucleus (Tesni�ere, 1959), or that in an endocen-tric theory projection can never fail, we present eight characteristics in more detail, which in their combination allow us to treat the majority of English long-distance dependencies (LDD) in our DG parser Pro3Gres in a context-fee way.",

        "In order to ensure this, the probability when a rewrite rule can stop expanding is calculated.",

        "Every complement relation type, namely subj, obj, obj2, sentobj, can only occur once per verb, which ensures one of the two major functions of a subcat frame, that non-subcategorized constituents cannot be attached as complements.",
        "This amounts to keeping separate subcat frames for each relation type, where the selection of the appropriate frame and removing the found constituent coincide, which has the advantage of a reduced search space: no hypothesized, but unfound subcat frame elements need to be managed.",
        "As for the second major function of subcat frames – to ensure that if possible all subcategorized constituents are found the same principle applies: selection of subcat frame and removing of found constituents coincide; lexical information on the verb argument candidate is available at frame selection time already.",
        "This implies that Collins Model 2 takes an unnecessary detour.",
        "As for the probability of stopping the expansion of a rule – since DG rules are always binary – it is always 0 before and 1 after the attachment.",
        "But what is needed in place of interrelations of constituents of the same rewrite rule is proper cooperation of the different subcat types.",
        "For example, the grammar rules only allow a noun to be obj2 once obj has been found, or a verb is required to have a subject unless it is non-finite or a participle, or all objects need to be closer to the verb than a subordinate clause.",
