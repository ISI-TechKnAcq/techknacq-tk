        "A sentence is represented by a sequence of eojeols which are the syntactic unit delimited by spacing characters in Korean.",
        "Unlike in English, an eojeol is not one word but composed of a series of words (content words and functional words).",
        "In particular, since an eojeol can often contain more than one noun, we cannot get proper interpretation of the sentence or phrase without its accurate segmentation.",
        "The problem in compound noun segmentation is that it is not possible to register all compound nouns in the dictionary since nouns are in the open set of words as well as the number of them is very large.",
        "Thus, they must be treated as unseen words without a segmentation process.",
        "Furthermore, accurate compound noun segmentation plays an important role in the application system.",

        "A user might want to retrieve documents about `seoPagsan(Seol'ag Mountain)', and then it is likely that the documents with seol'agsan-gugrib-gongwon' are also the ones in his interest.",
        "Therefore, it should be exactly segmented before indexing in order for the documents to be retrieved with the query `seol'agsan).",
        "Also, to translate ' seol'agsan-gugribgongwon' to Seol'ag Mountain National Park, the constituents should be identified first through the process of segmentation.",
        "This paper presents two methods for segmentation of compound nouns.",
        "First, we extract compound nouns from a large size of corpus, manually divide them into simple nouns and construct the hand built segmentation dictionary with them.",
        "The dictionary includes compound nouns which are frequently used and need exceptional process.",
        "The number of data are about 100,000.",
        "Second, the segmentation algorithm is applied if the compound noun does not exist in the built-in dictionary.",
        "Basically, the segmenter is based on frequency of individual nouns extracted from corpus.",
        "However, the problem is that it is difficult to distinguish proper noun and common noun since there is no clue like capital letters in Korean.",
        "Thus, just a large amount of lexical knowledge does not make good results if it contains incorrect data and also it is not appropriate to use frequencies obtained by automatically tagging large corpus.",
        "Moreover, sufficient lexical data cannot be acquired from small amounts of tagged corpus.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to get simple nouns and their frequencies from frequently occurring eojeols using repetitiveness of natural language.",
        "The amount of eojeols investigated is manually tractable and frequently used nouns extracted from them are crucial for compound noun segmentation.",
        "Furthermore, we propose min-max composition to divide a sequence of syllables, which would be proven to be an effective method by experiments.",
        "To briefly show the reason that we select the operation, let us consider the following example.",
        "Suppose that a compound noun be composed of four syllables '81828384 '.",
        "There are several possibilities of segmentation in the sequence of syllables, where we consider the following possibilities (si /828384) and (sis2 /8384).",
        "Assume that '.91' is a frequently appearing word in texts whereas '828354' is a rarely occurring sequence of syllables as a word.",
        "On the other hand '81.52' and `.5384' occurs frequently but although they don't occur as frequently as `.91'.",
        "In this case, the more likely segmentation would be (8182/8384).",
        "It means that a sequence of syllables should not be divided into frequently occurring one and rarely occurring one.",
        "In this sense, min-max is the appropriate operation for the selection.",
        "In other words, min value is selected between two sequences of syllables, and then maxis taken from min values selected.",
        "To apply the operation repetitively, we use the CYK tabular parsing style algorithm."

        "The advantage of using the built-in dictionary is that the segmentation could (1) be very accurate by handmade data and (2) become more efficient.",

        "For example, one syllable noun `.s.se in Korean might be used either as a suffix or as a noun which means `Mr/Ms' or 'seed' respectively.",
        "Without any semantic information, the best way to distinguish them is to record all the compound noun examples containing the meaning of seed in the dictionary since the number of compound nouns containing a meaning of 'seed' is even smaller.",

        "By the spacing rule for Korean, there should be one content word except noun in an eojeol, but it turns out that one or more content words of short length sometimes appear without space in real texts, which causes the lexical ambiguities.",
        "It makes the system inefficient to deal with all these words on the phase of basic morphological analysis.",
        "To construct the dictionary, compound nouns are extracted from corpus and manually elaborated.",

        "In compound noun segmentation, the thing that we pay attention to was that lexical information is crucial for segmenting noun compounds.",
        "Since a compound noun consists only of a sequence of nouns i.e. {noun}+, the transition probability of parts of speech is no use.",
        "Namely, the frequency of each noun plays highly important role in compound noun segmentation.",
        "Besides, since the parameter space is huge, we cannot extract enough lexical information from hundreds of thousands of POS tagged corpus' even if accurate lexical information can be extracted from annotated corpus.",
        "Thus, a large size of corpus should be used to extract proper frequencies of nouns.",
        "However, it is difficult to look at a large size of corpus and to assign analyses to it, which makes it difficult to estimate the frequency distribution of words.",

        "It must be noted here that each noun in compound nouns could be easily segmented by human in many cases because it has a prominent figure in the sense that it is a frequently used word and so familiar with him.",
        "In other words, nouns prominent in documents can be defined as frequently occurred ones, which we call distinct nouns.",
        "Compound nouns contains these distinct nouns in many cases, which makes it easier to segment them and to identify their constituents.",
        "Empirically, it is well-known that too many words in the dictionary have a bad influence on morphological analysis in Korean.",
        "It is because rarely used nouns result in oversegmentation if they are included in compound noun segmentation dictionary.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to select distinct nouns, which leads us to use a part of corpus instead of entire corpus that consists of frequently used ones in the corpus.",
        "First, we examined distribution of eojeols in corpus in order to make the subset of corpus to extract lexical frequencies of nouns.",
        "The notable thing in our experiment is that the number of eojeols in corpus is increased in proportion to the size of corpus, but a small portion of eojeols takes most parts of the whole corpus.",
        "For instance, 70% of the corpus consists of just 60 thousand types of eojeols which take 7.5 million of frequency from 10 million eojeol corpus and 20.5 million from 30 million eojeols.",
        "The lowest frequency of the 60,000 eojeols is 49 in 30 million eojeol corpus.",
        "We decided to take 60,000 eojeols which are manually tractable and compose most parts of corpus (Figure 1).",
        "Second, we made morphological analyses for the 60,000 eojeols by hand.",
        "Since Korean is an agglutinative language, an eojeol is represented by a sequence of content words and functional words as mentioned before.",
        "Especially, content words and functional words often have different distribution of syllables.",
        "In addition, inflectional endings for predicate and postpositions for nominals also have quite different distribution for syllables.",
        "Hence we can distinguish the constituents of eojeols in many cases.",
        "Of course, there are also many cases in which the result of morphological analysis has ambiguities.",
        "For example, an eojeol `na-neun' in Korean has ambiguity of `na/N+ neun/P', `na/PN+ neun/P' and `nal1V+neunIE'.",
        "In this example, the parts of speech N, PN, P, V and E mean noun, pronoun, postposition, verb and ending, respectively.",
        "On the other hand, many eojeols which are analyzed as having ambiguities by a morphological analyzer are actually not ambiguous.",
        "For instance, `ga-geora' (go/imperative) has ambiguities by most morphological analyzer among `ga/V+geora/E' and gaIN+i1C+geora/E' (C is copula), but it is actually not ambiguous.",
        "Such morphological ambiguity is caused by overgeneration of the morphological analyzer since the analyzer uses less detailed rules for robustness of the system.",
        "Therefore, if we examine and correct the results scrupulously, many ambiguities can be removed through the process.",
        "As the result of the manual process, only 15% of 60,000 eojeols remain ambiguous at the mid-level of part of speech classification2.",
        "Then, we extracted simple nouns and their frequencies from the data.",
        "Despite of manual correction, there must be ambiguities left for the reason mentioned above.",
        "There may be some methods to distribute frequencies in case of ambiguous words, but we simply assign the equal distribution to them.",
        "For instance, gage has two possibilities of analysis i.e. `gage/N' and `ga/V+ge/E), and its frequency is 2263, in which the noun 'gage' is assigned 1132 as its frequency.",
        "Table 2 shows examples of manually corrected morphological analyses of eojeols containing a noun 'gage' and their frequencies.",
        "We call the nouns extracted in such a way a set of distinct nouns.",
        "In addition, we supplement the dictionary with other nouns not appeared in the words obtained by the method mentioned above.",
        "First, nouns of more than three syllables are rare in real texts in Korean, as shown in Lee and Ahn (1996).",
        "Their experiments proved that syllable based bigram indexing model makes much better result than other n-gram model such as trigram and quadragram in Korean IR.",
        "It follows that two syllable nouns take an overwhelming majority in nouns.",
        "Thus, there are not many such nouns in the simple nouns extracted by the manually corrected nouns (a set of distinct nouns).",
        "In particular, since many nouns of more 2At the mid-level of part of speech classification, for example, endings and postpositions are represented just by one tag e.g. E and P. To identify the sentential or clausal type (subordinate or declarative) in Korean, the ending should be subclassified for syntactic analysis more detail which can be done by statistical process.",
        "It is beyond the subject of this paper.",
        "than three syllables are derived by a word and suffixes and have some syllable features, they are useful for distinguishing the boundaries of constituents in compound nouns.",

        "As we mentioned earlier, it is desirable that the eojeol is segmented in the position where each sequence of syllables to be divided occurs frequently enough in training data.",
        "As the length of a sequence of syllables is shorter in Korean, it occurs more frequently.",
        "That is, the shorter part usually have higher frequency than the other (longer) part when we divide syllables into two.",
        "Moreover, if the other part is the syllables that we rarely see in texts, then the part would not be a word.",

        "Actually, gyo-saeng-hwal is not a word.",
        "On the other hand, both hag-gyo and saeng-hwal are frequently occurring syllables, and actually they are all words.",

        "For the test of compound noun segmentation, we first extracted compound noun from ETRI POS tagged corpus3.",
        "By the processing, 1774 types of compound nouns were extracted, which was used as a gold standard test set.",
        "We evaluated our system by two methods: (1) the precision and recall rate, and (2) segmentation accuracy per compound noun which we refer to as SA.",
        "They are defined respectively as follows:",
        "What influences on the Korean IR, system is whether words are appropriately segmented or not.",
        "The precision and recall estimate how appropriate the segmentation results are.",
        "They are 98.04% and 97.80% respectively, which shows that our algorithm is very effective (Table 3).",
        "SA reflects how accurate the segmentation is for a compound noun at all.",
        "We compared two methods: (1) using only the segmentation algorithm with default analysis which is a baseline of our system and so is needed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm.",
        "(2) using both the built-in dictionary and the segmentation algorithm which reflects system accuracy as a whole.",
        "As shown in Table 4, the baseline performance using only distinct nouns and the algorithm is about 94.3% and fairly good.",
        "From the results, we can find that the distinct nouns has great impact on compound noun segmentation.",
        "Also, the overall segmentation accuracy for the gold standard is about 97.29% which is a very good result for the application system.",
        "In addition, it shows that the built-in dictionary supplements the algorithm which results in better segmentation.",
        "Lastly, we compare our system with the previous work by (Yun et al.",
        ", 1997).",
        "It is impossible that we directly compare our result with theirs, since the test set is different.",
        "It was reported that the accuracy given in the paper is about 95.6%.",
        "When comparing the performance only in terms of the accuracy, our system outperforms theirs.",
        "Embeded in the morphological analyzer, the compound noun segmentater is currently being used for some projects on MT and IE which are worked in several institutes and it turns out that the system is very effective."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we presented the new method for Korean compound noun segmentation.",
        "First, we proposed the lexical acquisition for compound noun analysis, which consists of the manually constructed segmentation dictionary (HBSD) and the dictionary for applying the segmentation algorithm (SND).",
        "The hand-built segmentation dictionary was made manually for compound nouns extracted from corpus.",
        "The simple noun dictionary is based on very frequently occurring nouns which are called distinct nouns because they are clues for identifying constituents of compound nouns.",
        "Second, the compound noun was segmented based on the modification of CYK tabular parsing and min-max composition, which was proven to be the very effective method by experiments.",
        "The bottom up approach using min-max operation guarantees the most likely segmentation, being applied in the same way as dynamic programming.",
        "With our new method, the result for segmentation is as accurate as 97.29%.",
        "Especially, the algorithm made results good enough and the built-in dictionary supplemented the algorithm.",
        "Consequently, the methodology is promising and the segmentation system would be helpful for the application system such as machine translation and information retrieval."
