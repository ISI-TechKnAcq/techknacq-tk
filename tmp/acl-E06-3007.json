        "It is a while since the linearisation technique was introduced into HPSG by Reape (1993; 1994) as a way to overcome the inadequacy of the conventional phrase structure rule based grammars in handling ‘freer’ word order of languages such as German and Japanese.",
        "In parallel in computational linguistics, it has long been proposed that more flexible parsing techniques may be required to adequately handle such languages, but hitherto a practical system using linearisation has eluded large-scale implementation.",
        "There are at least two obstacles: its higher computational cost accompanied with non-CFG algorithms it requires, and the difficulty to state word order information succinctly in a grammar that works well with a non-CFG parsing engine.",
        "In a recent development, the ‘cost’ issue has been tackled by Daniels and Meurers (2004), who propose to narrow down on search space while using a non-CFG algorithm.",
        "The underlying principle is to give priority to the full generative capacity, let the parser overgenerate at default but restrict generation for efficiency thereafter.",
        "While sharing this principle, I will attempt to further streamline the computation of linearisation, focusing mainly on the issue of grammar formalism.",
        "Specifically, I would like to show that the lex-icalisation of word order constraints is possible with some conservative modifications to the standard HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1994).",
        "This will have the benefit of making the representation of linearisation grammar simpler and more parsing friendly than Reape’s influential Word Order Domain theory.",
        "In what follows, after justifying the need for non-CFG parsing and reviewing Reape’s theory, I will propose to introduce into HPSG the Word Order Constraint (WOC) feature for lexical heads.",
        "I will then describe the parsing algorithm that refers to this feature to constrain the search for efficiency."

      "text": [
        "One of the main obstacles for CFG parsing is the discontinuity in natural languages caused by ‘interleaving’ of elements from different phrases (Shieber, 1985).",
        "Although there are well-known syntactic techniques to enhance CFG as in GPSG (Gazdar et al., 1985), there remain constructions that show ‘genuine’ discontinuity of the kind that cannot be properly dealt with by CFG.",
        "Such ‘difficult’ discontinuity typically occurs when it is combined with scrambling – another symptomatic phenomenon of free word order languages – of a verb’s complements.",
        "The following is an example from German, where scrambling and discontinuity co-occur in what is called ‘incoherent’ object control verb construction.",
        "(1’) Ich glaube, dass der Fritz [das Buch] dem Frank [zu lesen] erlaubt Ich glaube, dass dem Frank [das Buch] der Fritz [zu lesen] erlaubt Ich glaube, dass [das Buch] dem Frank der Fritz [zu lesen] erlaubt ...",
        "Here (1) is in the ‘canonical’ word order while the examples in (1’) are its scrambled variants.",
        "In the traditional ‘bi-clausal’ analysis according to which the object control verb subcategorises for a zu-infinitival VP complement as well as nominal complements, this embedded VP, das Buch zu lesen, becomes discontinuous in the latter examples (in square brackets).",
        "One CFG response is to use ‘mono-clausal’ analysis or argument composition(Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1990), according to which the higher verb and lower verb (in the above example er-lauben and zu lesen) are combined to form a single verbal complex, which in turn subcategorises for nominal complements (das Buch, der Fritz and dem Frank).",
        "Under this treatment both the verbal complex and the sequence of complements are rendered continuous, rendering all the above examples CFG-parseable.",
        "However, this does not quite save the CFG parseability, in the face of the fact that you could extrapose the lower V + NP, as in the following.",
        "(2) Ich glaube, dass der Fritz dem Frank [erlaubt], das Buch [zu lesen].",
        "Now we have a discontinuity of ‘verbal complex’ instead of complements (the now discontinuous verbal complex is marked with square brackets).",
        "Thus either way, some discontinuity is inevitable.",
        "Such discontinuity is by no means a marginal phenomenon limited to German.",
        "Parallel phenomena are observed in the object control verbs in Korean and Japanese ((Sato, 2004) for examples).",
        "These languages also show a variety of ‘genuine’ discontinuity of other sorts, which do not lend itself to a straightforward CFG parsing (Yatabe, 1996).",
        "The CFG-recalcitrant constructions exist in abundance, pointing to an acute need for non-CFG parsing."

        "The most influential proposal to accommodate such discontinuity/scrambling in HPSG is Reape’s Word Order Domain, or DOM, a feature that constitutes an additional layer separate from the dominance structure of phrases (Reape, 1993; Reape, 1994).",
        "DOM encodes the phonologically realised (‘linearised’) list of signs: the daughter signs of a",
        "phrase in the HD-DTR and NHD-DTRS features are linearly ordered as in Figure 1.",
        "The feature UNIONED in the daughters indicates whether discontinuity amongst their constituents is allowed.",
        "Computationally, the positive (‘+’) value of the feature dictates (the DOMs of) the daughters to be sequence unioned (represented by the operator Q) into the mother DOM: details apart, this operation essentially merges two lists in a way that allows interleaving of their elements.",
        "In Reape’s theory, LP constraints come from an entirely different source.",
        "There is nothing as yet that blocks, for instance, the ungrammatical zu lesen das Buch VP sequence.",
        "The relevant constraint, i.e. COMPS�ZU-INF-V in German, is stated in the LP component of the theory.",
        "Thus with the interaction of the UNIONED feature and LP statements, the grammar rules out the unacceptable sequences while endorsing grammatical ones such as the examples in (1’).",
        "One important aspect of Reape’s theory is that DOM is a list of whole signs rather than of any part of them such as PHON.",
        "This is necessitated by the fact that in order to determine how DOM should be constructed, the daughters’ internal structure need to be referred to, above all, the UNIONED feature.",
        "In other words, the internal features of the daughters must be accessible.",
        "While this is a powerful system that overcomes the inadequacies of phrase-structure rules, some may feel this is a rather heavy-handed way to solve the problems.",
        "Above all, much information is repeated, as all the signs are effectively stated twice, once in the phrase structure and again in DOM.",
        "Also, the fact that discontinuity and linear precedence are handled by two distinct mechanisms seems somewhat questionable, as these two factors are computationally closely related.",

        "Our theoretical goal is, in a nutshell, to achieve what Reape does, namely handling discontinuity and linear precedence, in a simpler, more lexical-ist manner.",
        "My central proposal consists in incorporating the Word Order Constraint (WOC) feature into the lexical heads, rather than positing an additional tier for linearisation.",
        "Some new sub-features will also be introduced.",
        "The value of the WOC feature is a set of word-order related constraints.",
        "It may contain any relational constraint the grammar writer may want with the proviso of its formalisability, but for the current proposal, I include two subfeatures ADJ (adjacency) and LP, both of which, being binary relations, are represented as a set of ordered pairs, the members of which must either be the head itself or its sisters.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates what such feature structure looks like with an English verb provide, as in provide him with a book.",
        "We will discuss the new PHON subfeatures in the next section – for now it would suffice to consider them to constitute the standard PHON list – so let us focus on WOC here.",
        "The WOC feature of this verb says, for its projection (VP), three constraints have to be observed.",
        "Firstly, the ADJ sub-feature says that the indirect object NP has to be in the adjacent position to the verb (‘provide yesterday him with a book’ is not allowed).",
        "Secondly, the first two elements of the LP value encode a head-initial constraint for English VPs, namely that a head verb has to be preceded by its complements.",
        "Lastly, the last pair in the same set says the indirect object must precede the with-PP (‘provide with a book him’ is not allowed).",
        "Notice that this specification leaves room for some discontinuity, as there is no ADJ requirement between the indirect NP and with-PP.",
        "Hence, provide him yesterday with a book is allowed.",
        "The key idea here is that since the complements of a lexical head are available in its COMPS feature, it should be possible to state the relative linear order which holds between the head and a complement, as well as between complements, inside the feature structure of the head.",
        "Admittedly word order would naturally be considered to reside in a phrase, string of words.",
        "It might be argued, on the ground that a head’s COMPS feature simply consists of the categories it selects for in exclusion of the PHON feature, that with this architecture one would inevitably encounter the ‘accessibility’ problem discussed in",
        "Section 1.2: in order to ensure the enforceability of word order constraints, an access must be secured to the values of the internal features including the PHON values.",
        "However, this problem can be overcome, as we will see, if due arrangements are in place.",
        "The main benefit of this mechanism is that it paves way to an entirely lexicon-based rule specification, so that, on one hand, duplication of information between lexical specification and phrase structure rules can be reduced and on the other, a wide variety of lexical properties can be flexibly handled.",
        "If the word order constraints, which have been regarded as the bastion of rule-based grammars, is shown to be lexically handled, it is one significant step further to a fully lexicalist grammar."

        "What is crucial for this WOC-incorporated grammar is how the required word order constraints stated in WOC are passed on and enforced in its projection.",
        "I attempt to formalise this in the form of Head-Argument Schema, by modifying Head-Complement Schema of Pollard and Sag (1994).",
        "There are two key revisions: an enriched PHON feature that contains word order constraints and percolation of these constraints emanating from the WOC feature in the head.",
        "The revised Schema is shown in Figure 3.",
        "For simplicity only the LP subfeature is dealt with, since the ADJ subfeature would work exactly the same way.",
        "The set notations attached underneath states the restriction on the value of WOC, namely that all the signs that appear in the constraint pairs must be ‘relevant’, i.e. must also appear as daughters (included in ‘DtrSet’, the set of the head daughter and non-head daughters).",
        "Naturally, they also cannot be the same signs (x7k=y).",
        "Let me discuss some auxiliary modifications",
        "first.",
        "Firstly, we change the feature name from COMPS to ARGS because we assume a non-configurational flat structure, as is commonly the case with linearisation grammar.",
        "Another change I propose is to make ARGS a list of underspecified signs instead of SYNSEMs as standardly assumed (Pollard and Sag, 1994).",
        "In fact, this is a position taken in an older version of HPSG (Pol-lard and Sag, 1987) but rejected on the ground of the locality of subcategorisation.",
        "The main reason for this reversal is to facilitate the ‘accessibility’ we discussed earlier.",
        "As unification and percolation of the PHON information is involved in the Schema, it is much more straightforward to formulate with signs.",
        "Though the change may not be quite defensible solely on this ground,1 there is reason to leave the locality principle as an option for languages of which it holds rather than hard-wire it into the Schema, since some authors raise doubt as for the universal applicability of the locality principle e.g. (Meurers, 1999).",
        "Turning to a more substantial modification, our new PHON feature consists of two subfeatures, CONSTITUENTS (or CONSTITS) and CONSTRAINTS (or CONSTRS).",
        "The former encodes the set that comprises the phonology of words of which the string consists.",
        "Put simply, it is the un-1Another potential problem is cyclicity, since the sign-valued ARGS feature contains the WOC feature, which could contain the head itself.",
        "This has to be fixed for the systems that do not allow cyclicity.",
        "ordered version of the standard PHON list.",
        "The CONSTRAINTS feature represents the concata-native constraints applicable to the string.",
        "Thus, the PHON feature overall represents the legitimate word order patterns in an underspecified way, i.e. any of the possible string combinations that obey the constraints.",
        "Let me illustrate with a VP example, say, consisting of meet, often and Tom, for which we assume that the following word order patterns are acceptable, (meet, Tom, often), (often, meet, Tom) but not the followings: (meet, often, Tom), (Tom, often, meet), (Tom, meet, often), (often, Tom, meet).",
        "This situation can be captured by the following feature specification for PHON, which encodes any of the acceptable strings above in an underspecified way.",
        "The key point is that now the computation of word order can be done based on the information inside the PHON feature, though indeed the CON-STR values have to come from outside – the word order crucially depends on SYNSEM-related values of the daughter signs.",
        "Let us now go back to the Schema in Figure 3 and see how to determine the CONSTR values to enter the PHON feature.",
        "This is achieved by looking up the WOC constraints in the head (let’s call this Step 1) and pushing the relevant constraints into the PHON feature of its mother, according to the type of constraints (Step 2).",
        "For readability Figure 3 only states explicitly a special case – where one LP constraint holds of two of the arguments – but the reader is asked to interpret ai and aj in the head daughter’s WOC|LP to represent any two signs chosen from the ‘DTRS’ list (including the head, hd).2 The structure sharing of ai and aj between WOC|LP and ARGS indicates that the LP constraint applies to these two arguments in this order, i.e. ai-<aj.",
        "Thus through unification, it is determined which constraints apply to which pairs of daughter signs inside the head.",
        "This corresponds to Step 1.",
        "Now, only for these WOC-applicable daughter signs, the PHON|CONSTIITS values are paired up for each constraint (in this case (pai, paj�) and pushed into the mother’s PHON|CONSTRS feature.",
        "This corresponds to Step 2.",
        "Notice also that the CONSTRAINTS subfeature is cumulatively inherited.",
        "All the non-head daughters’ CONSTR values (ca1,...,can) – the word order constraints applicable to each of these daughters – are also passed up, collecting effectively all the CONSTR values of its daughters and descendants.",
        "This means the information concerning word order, as tied to particular string pairs, is never lost and passed up all the way through.",

        "In this section our parsing algorithm that works with the lexicalised linearisation grammar outlined above is briefly overviewed.4 It expands on two existing ideas: bitmasks for non-CFG parsing and dynamic constraint application.",

        "permutations but discontinuous realisations thereof in a longer string, such as [book, -, the, -, thick] (‘-’ indicates the positions of constituents from other phrases).",
        "Clearly, the problem here is overgeneration and (in)efficiency.",
        "In the current form the worst-case complexity will be exponential (o(n!•2n), n = length of string).",
        "In response, Daniels and Meurers (2004) propose to restrict search space during the parse with two additional bitmasks, positive and negative masks, which encode the bits that must be and must not be occupied, respectively, based on what has been found thus far and the relevant word order constraints.",
        "For example, given the constraints that Det precedes Nom and Det must be adjacent to Nom and supposing the parser has found Det in the third position of a five word string like above, the negative mask [ x, x, the, -, -] is created, where x indicates the position that cannot be occupied by Nom, as well as the positive mask [ * , das, *, -], where * indicates the positions that must be occupied by Nom.",
        "Thus, you can stop the parser from searching the positions the categories yet to be found cannot occupy, or force it to search only the positions they have to occupy.",
