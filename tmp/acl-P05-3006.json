        "Much of effort in Question Answering has focused on the ‘short answers’ or factoid questions, which answer questions for which the correct response is a single word or short phrase from the answer sentence.",
        "However, there are many questions which are better answer with a longer description or explanation in logs of web search engines(Voorhees, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new descriptive QA model and present the result of a system which we have built to answer such questions.",
        "Descriptive question are questions such as “Who is Columbus?”, “What is tsunami?”, or “Why is blood red?”, which need answer that contain the definitional information about the search term, explain some special phenomenon.(i.e.",
        "chemical reaction) or describe some particular events.",
        "At the recent works, definitional QA, namely questions of the form “What is X?”, is a developing research area related with a subclass of descriptive questions.",
        "Especially in TREC-12 conference(Voorhees, 2003), they had produced 50 definitional questions in QA track for the competition.",
        "The systems in TREC-12(Blair et al., 2003; Katz et al., 2004) applied complicated technique which was integrated manually constructed definition patterns with statistical ranking component.",
        "Some experiments(Cui et al., 2004) tried to use external resources such as WordNet and Web Dictionary associated with a syntactic pattern.",
        "Further recent work tried to use online knowledge bases on web.",
        "Domain-specific definitional QA systems in the same context of our works have been developed.",
        "Shiffman et al(2001) applied on biographical summaries for people with data-driven method.",
        "In contrast to former research, we focus on the other descriptive question, such as “why,” “how,” and “what kind of”.",
        "We also present our descriptive QA model and its experimental results."

        "Our QA system is a domain specific system for encyclopedia 1 .",
        "One of the characteristics of encyclopedia is that it has many descriptive sentences.",
        "Because encyclopedia contains facts about many different subjects or about one particular subject explained for reference, there are",
        "many sentences which present definition such as “X is Y.” On the other hand, some sentences describe process of some special event(i.e. the 1st World War) so that it forms particular sentence structures like news article which reveal reasons or motives of the event.",
        "We defined Descriptive Answer Type (DAT) as answer types for descriptive questions with two points of view: what kind of descriptive questions are in the use’s frequently asked questions?",
        "and what kind of descriptive answers can be patternized in the our corpus?",
        "On the view of question, most of user’s frequently asked questions are not only factoid questions but also definitional questions.",
        "Furthermore, the result of analyzing the logs of our web site shows that there are many questions about ‘why’, “how’, and so on.",
        "On the other side, descriptive answer sentences in corpus show particular syntactic patterns such as appositive clauses, parallel clauses, and adverb clauses of cause and effect.",
        "In this paper, we defined 10 types of DAT to reflect these features of sentences in encyclopedia.",
        "Table 1 shows example sentences with pattern for each DAT.",
        "For instance, “A tsunami is a large wave, often caused by an earthquake.” is an example for ‘Definition’ DAT with pattern of [X is Y].",

        "Descriptive Answer indexing process consists of two parts: pattern extraction from pre-tagged corpus and extraction of DIU(Descriptive Indexing Unix) using a pattern matching technique.",
        "Descriptive answer sentences generally have a particular syntactic structure.",
        "For instance, definitional sentences has patterns such as “X is Y,” “X is called Y,” and “X means Y.” In case of sentence which classifies something into sub-kinds, i.e. “Our coin are 50 won, 100 won and 500 won.” it forms parallel structure like “X are Y1, Y2,.. and Y” nTo extract these descriptive patterns, we first build initial patterns.",
        "We constructed pre-tagged corpus with 10 DAT tags, then performed sentence alignment by the surface tag boundary.",
        "The tagged sentences are then processed through part-of-speech(POS) tagging in the first step.",
        "In this stage, we can get descriptive clue terms and structures, such as “X is caused by Y” for ‘Reason’, ‘X was made for Y” for ‘Function’, and so on.",
        "In the second step, we used linguistic analysis including chunking and parsing to extend initial patterns automatically.",
        "Initial patterns are too rigid because we look up only surface of sentences in the first step.",
        "If some clue terms appear with long distance in a sentence, it can fail to be recognized as a pattern.",
        "To solve this problem, we added sentence structure patterns on each DAT patterns, such as appositive clause patterns for ‘Definition’, parallel clause patterns for ‘Kind’, and so on.",
        "Finally, we generalized patterns to conduct flexible pattern matching.",
        "We need to group patterns to adapt to various variations of terms which appear in un-training sentences.",
        "Several similar patterns under the same DAT tag were integrated into regular-expression union which is to be formulated automata.",
        "For example, ‘Definition’ patterns are represented by [X<NP> be called/named/known as Y<NP>].",
        "We defined DIU as indexing unit for descriptive answer candidate.",
        "In DIU indexing stage performed pattern matching, extracting DIU, and storing our storage.",
        "We built a pattern matching system based on Finite State Automata(FSA).",
        "After pattern matching, we need to filtering over-generated candidates because descriptive patterns are naive in a sense.",

        "pattern when “X” and “Y” under the same meaning on our ETRI-LCN for Noun ontology 2.",
        "For example, “Customs duties are taxes that people pay for importing and exporting goods[X is Y]” are accepted because ‘custom duty’ is under the ‘tax’ node so they have same meaning.",
