        "Topic segmentation consists in evidentiating the semantic structure of a document: Algorithms developed for this task aim at automatically detecting frontiers which define topically coherent segments in a text.",
        "Various methods for topic segmentation of textual data are described in the literature, e.g., (Reynar, 1994; Hearst, 1997; Ferret et al., 1998; Choi, 2000; Moens and Busser, 2001; Utiyama and Isa-hara, 2001), most of them relying on the notion of lexical cohesion, i.e., identifying segments with a consistent use of vocabulary, either based on words or on semantic relations between words.",
        "Reoccur-rences of words or related words and lexical chains are two popular methods to evidence lexical cohesion.",
        "This general principle of lexical cohesion is further exploited for topic segmentation with two radically different strategies.",
        "On the one hand, a measure of the lexical cohesion can be used to determine coherent segments (Reynar, 1994; Moens and Busser, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001).",
        "On the other hand, shifts in the use of vocabulary can be searched for to directly identify the segment frontiers by measuring the lexical disruption (Hearst, 1997).",
        "Techniques based on the first strategy yield more accurate segmentation results, but face a problem of over-segmentation which can, up to now, only be solved by providing prior information regarding the distribution of segment length or the expected number of segments.",
        "In this paper, we propose a segmentation criterion combining both cohesion and disruption along with the corresponding algorithm for topic segmentation.",
        "Such a criterion ensures a coherent use of vocabulary within each resulting segment, as well as a significant difference of vocabulary between neighboring segments.",
        "Moreover, the combination of these two strategies enables regularizing the number of segments found without resorting to prior knowledge.",
        "This piece of work uses the algorithm of Utiyama and Isahara (2001) as a starting point, a versatile and performing topic segmentation algorithm cast in a statistical framework.",
        "Among the benefits of this algorithm are its independency to any particular domain and its ability to cope with thematic segments",
        "of highly varying lengths, two interesting features to obtain a generic solution to the problem of topic segmentation.",
        "Moreover, the algorithm has proven to be up to the state of the art in several studies, with no need of a priori information about the number of segments (contrary to algorithms in (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) that can attain a higher segmentation accuracy).",
        "It also provides an efficient graph based implementation of which we take advantage.",
        "To account both for cohesion and disruption, we extend the formalism of Isahara and Utiyama using a Markovian assumption between segments in place of the independence assumption of the original algorithm.",
        "Keeping unchanged their probabilistic measure of lexical cohesion, the Markovian assumption enables to introduce the disruption between two consecutive segments.",
        "We propose an extended graph based decoding strategy, which is both optimal and efficient, exploiting the notion of generalized segment model or semi hidden Markov models.",
        "Tests are performed on standard textual data sets and on a more challenging corpus of automatically transcribed broadcast news shows.",
        "The seminal idea of this paper was partially published in (Simon et al., 2013) in the French language.",
        "The current paper significantly elaborates on the latter, with a more detailed description of the algorithm and additional contrastive experiments including more data sets.",
        "In particular, new experiments clearly demonstrate the benefit of the method in a realistic setting with statistically significant gains.",
        "The organization of the article is as follows.",
        "Existing work on topic segmentation is presented in Section 2, emphasizing the motivations of the model we propose.",

        "Finding out an appropriate window size and extracting boundaries become critical with segments of varying length, in particular when short segments are present.",
        "Short windows will render comparison of adjacent blocks difficult and unreliable while long windows cannot handle short segments.",

        "Short segments are therefore very likely to be coherent which calls for regularization introduced as priors on the segments length.",
        "These considerations naturally lead to the idea of methods combining lexical cohesion and disruption to make the best of both worlds.",
