        "SPORT,",
        "POLITICS, etc.)",
        "and, even if a large amount of hand tagged texts is required, the state-of-the-art supervised learning techniques represent a viable and well-performing solution for monolingual categorization problems.",
        "On the other hand in the worldwide scenario of the web age, multilinguality is a crucial issue to deal with and to investigate, leading us to reformulate most of the classical NLP problems.",

        "In this setting, the system is trained using labeled examples in a source language (e.g. English), and it classifies documents in a different target language (e.g. Italian).",
        "In this paper we propose a novel approach to solve the cross language text categorization problem based on acquiring Multilingual Domain Models (MDM) from comparable corpora in an unsupervised way.",
        "A MDM is a set of clusters formed by terms in different languages.",
        "While in the monolingual settings semantic domains are clusters of related terms that co-occur in texts regarding similar topics (Gliozzo et al., 2004), in the multilingual settings such clusters are composed by terms in different languages expressing concepts in the same semantic field.",
        "Thus, the basic relation modeled by a MDM is the domain similarity among terms in different languages.",
        "Our claim is that such a relation is sufficient to capture relevant aspects of topic similarity that can be profitably used for TC purposes.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After a brief discussion about comparable corpora, we introduce",
        "a multilingual Vector Space Model, in which documents in different languages can be represented and then compared.",
        "In Section 4 we define the MDMs and we present a totally unsupervised technique to acquire them from comparable corpora.",
        "This methodology does not require any external knowledge source (e.g. bilingual dictionaries) and it is based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deer-wester et al., 1990).",
        "MDMs are then exploited to define a Multilingual Domain Kernel, a generalized similarity function among documents in different languages that exploits a MDM (see Section 5).",
        "The Multilingual Domain Kernel is used inside a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification framework for TC (Joachims, 2002).",

        "Comparable corpora are collections of texts in different languages regarding similar topics (e.g. a collection of news published by agencies in the same period).",
        "More restrictive requirements are expected for parallel corpora (i.e. corpora composed by texts which are mutual translations), while the class of the multilingual corpora (i.e. collection of texts expressed in different languages without any additional requirement) is the more general.",
        "Obviously parallel corpora are also comparable, while comparable corpora are also multilingual.",
        "In a more precise way, let L = {L1, L2, ... , Ll} be a set of languages, let Ti = {ti1, ti2, ... , tin} be a collection of texts expressed in the language Li E L, and let 0(tjh, tiz) be a function that returns 1 if tiz is the translation of tjh and 0 otherwise.",
        "A multilingual corpus is the collection of texts defined by T* = Ui Ti.",
        "If the function 0 exists for every text tiz E T* and for every language Lj, and is known, then the corpus is parallel and aligned at document level.",
        "For the purpose of this paper it is enough to assume that two corpora are comparable, i.e. they are composed by documents about the same topics and produced in the same period (e.g. possibly from different news agencies), and it is not known if a function 0 exists, even if in principle it could exist and return 1 for a strict subset of document pairs.",
        "There exist many interesting works about using parallel corpora for multilingual applications (Melamed, 2001), such as Machine Translation, Cross language Information Retrieval (Littman et al., 1998), lexical acquisition, and so on.",
        "However it is not always easy to find or build parallel corpora.",
        "This is the main reason because the weaker notion of comparable corpora is a matter recent interest in the field of Computational Linguistics (Gaussier et al., 2004).",
        "The texts inside comparable corpora, being about the same topics (i.e. about the same semantic domains), should refer to the same concepts by using various expressions in different languages.",
        "On the other hand, most of the proper nouns, relevant entities and words that are not yet lexicalized in the language, are expressed by using their original terms.",
        "As a consequence the same entities will be denoted with the same words in different languages, allowing to automatically detect couples of translation pairs just by looking at the word shape (Koehn and Knight, 2002).",
        "Our hypothesis is that comparable corpora contain a large amount of such words, just because texts, referring to the same topics in different languages, will often adopt the same terms to denote the same entitiesl.",

        "In this setting, the similarity among texts in different languages could be estimated by exploiting the classical VSM just described.",
