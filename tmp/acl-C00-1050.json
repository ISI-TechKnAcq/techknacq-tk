        "TOSHIBA developed the world's first Japanese word processor in 1978.",
        "Unlike languages based on an alphabet, Japanese uses thousands of kanji characters of varying complexity.",
        "Hence, to arrange all of kanii characters on keyboard is difficult.",
        "On the other hand, liana characters which are phonetic scripts of Japanese have 83 variations; these can be arranged on keyboard.",
        "As a result, conversion from kana notations to kanji ones, what is called kana-kanji conversion, has been used.",
        "Since Japanese is not written separately by words, segmentation of typed kana character strings has ambiguity.",
        "And an ambiguity in conversion exists, too; a kana notation may correspond to some different kanji notations.",
        "These make kana-kanji conversion challenging.",
        "We have made efforts to raise a precision of kana-kanji conversion, thinking that high precision can provide a better input environment for the user.",
        "A precision of our kana-kanji conversion system reaciies 95-98% for several kinds of texts in our previous experiments.",
        "Nevertheless, this approach is not enough in the situations where fast typing is hard, e.g., for beginners who are not familiar with keyboard or for palm-size computers.",
        "Thus, new method to reduce key input operations is needed.",
        "We propose a kan,a-kanji conversion system with input support based on prediction.",
        "This system is composed of two parts: prediction of succeeding kanji character strings from typed kana ones, and ordinary kana-kanji conversion.",
        "It automatically shows candidates of kanji char-ader strings which the user intends to input.",
        "The candidates change as the user inputs kana characters.",
        "if no appropriate choice is presented, Ole candidates automatically disappear when the next kana character is entered.",
        "Our system, therefore, can be used in the same manner as an ordinary kana-kanji conversion system, and allows the user to save time and efforts for key input without learning new key operations.",
        "We have been considered two issues to generate accurate candidates:",
        "(i) How to determine where typed kana character strings are segmented; since Japanese is not written separately by words, determination of positions where words start is needed to retrieve dictionaries.",
        "(ii) How to determine when prediction candidates are presented; if all of retrieval results are always shown, a system cannot be convenient.",
        "Surveying previous works from the view on above issues, we found that the Reactive Keyboard has been proposed (Darragh et al., 1980).",
        "It accelerates typewritten communication with",
        "a computer system by predicting what the user is going to type next.",
        "In this system, the top of typed character strings is regarded as the top of words, because English is written separately by words; the issue of segmentation of character strings does not occur.",
        "On the other hand, in previous works for Japanese, a predictive pen-based text input method has been proposed (Fukushima and Ya-mada, 1996).",
        "In this system, character strings are input by handwriting on LCD panel.",
        "Since the user usually inputs not only by Lima but also by k,anji and an alphabet, entered character strings are segmented with the help of the variety of characters.",
        "Thus, the issue of segmentation is not considered.",
        "The POBox (Pen-Operations Based On eX-ample) which is a text input method for pen-based computers has also been proposed (Ma-sui, 1998).",
        "It shows succeeding candidates from character staings input by software keyboard.",
        "Arbitrary positions of input character strings can be regarded as the top of words, and retrieval results are always shown as candidates; the prediction ordering is based on the user's previous choice.",
        "Since input speed by pen is not faster than that by keyboard, time to choose candidates is shorter than that to input characters.",
        "Hence, even if many candidates are shown, this method is effective for pen-based computers.",
        "It is, however, inefficient for ordinary keyboard.",
        "We propose a system with following features:",
        "(i) Arbitrary positions of typed kana character strings are regarded as the top of words.",
        "(ii) A system dictionary and a user dictionary are used, and each entry in the system dictionary has certainty factor calculated from the frequency of words in corpora.",
        "(iii) Candidates are estimated by certainty factor and usefulness factor, and likely ones with greater factors than thresholds are shown.",
        "These features provide an efficient Japanese text input environment for ordinary keyboard without learning new key operations.",
        "Section 2 shows an example of text input using the proposed system.",
        "Section 3 explains an input support method based on prediction.",
        "Section 4 shows efficiency of our system by means of experiments.",
        "Section 5 describes conclusions."
