        "Automated understanding of connected text remains an unsolved challenge in NLP.",
        "In contrast to systems that harvest information from large collections of text, or that extract only certain pre-specified kinds of information from single texts, the task of extracting and integrating all information from a single text, and building a coherent and relatively complete representation of its full content, is still beyond current capabilities.",
        "A significant obstacle is the fact that text always omits information that is important, but that people recover effortlessly.",
        "Authors leave out information that they assume is known to their readers, since its inclusion (under the Gricean maxim of minimality) would carry an additional, often pragmatic, import.",
        "The problem is that systems cannot perform the recovery since they lack the requisite background knowledge and inferential machinery to use it.",
        "In this research we address the problem of automatically recovering such omitted information to 'plug the gaps' in text.",
        "To do so, we describe the background knowledge required as well as a procedure for recognizing where gaps exist and determining which kinds of background knowledge are needed.",
        "We are looking for the synchronization between the text representation achievable by current NLP and a knowledge representation (KR) scheme that can permit further inference for text interpretation.",
        "Clearly, producing a rich text interpretation requires both NLP and KR capabilities.",
        "The strategy we explore is the enablement of bidirectional communication between the two sides from the very beginning of the text processing.",
        "We assume that the KR system doesn't require a full representation of the text meaning, but can work with a partial interpretation, namely of the material explicitly present in the text, and can then flesh out this interpretation as required for its specific task.",
        "Although the NLP system initially provides simpler representations (even possibly ambiguous or wrong ones), the final result contains the semantics of the text according to the working domain.",
        "In this model, the following questions arise: How much can we simplify our initial text representation and still permit the attachment of background knowledge for further inference and interpretation?",
        "How should background knowledge be represented for use by the KR system?",
        "How can the incompleteness and brittleness typical of background knowledge (its representational inflexibility, or limitation to a single viewpoint or expressive phrasing) (Barker 2007) be overcome?",
        "In what sequence can a KR system enrich an initial and/or impoverished reading, and how can the enrichment benefit subsequent text processing?",
        "Although we are working toward it, we do not yet have such a system.",
        "The aim of our current work is to rapidly assemble some necessary pieces and explore how to (i) attach background knowledge to flesh out a simple text representation and (ii) there by make explicit the meanings attached to some of its syntactic relations.",
        "We begin with an initial simple text representation, a background knowledge base corresponding to the text, and a simple formalized procedure to attach elements from the background knowledge to the entities and implicit relations present in the initial text representation.",
        "Surprisingly, we find that some quite simple processing can be effective if we are able to contextualize the text under interpretation.",
        "For our exploratory experiments, we are working with a collection of 30,000 documents in the domain of US football.",
        "We parsed the collection using a standard dependency parser (Marneffe and Manning, 2008; Klein and Maning, 2003) and, after collapsing some syntactic dependencies, obtained the simple textual representations shown in Section 2.",
        "From them, we built a Background Knowledge Base by automatically harvesting propositions expressed in the collection (Section 3).",
        "Their frequency in the collection lead the enrichment process: given a new text in the same domain, we build exactly the same kind of representation, and attach the background knowledge propositions as related to the text (Section 4).",
        "Since this is an exploratory sketch, we cannot provide a quantitative evaluation yet, but the qualitative study over some examples suggest that this simple framework is promising enough to start a long term research (Section 5).",
        "Finally, we conclude with the next steps we want to follow and the kind of evaluation we plan to do."

        "So, in this case, the BKB suggests that the syntactic dependency \"Steve_Walsh:nn:pass\" means \"Steve_Walsh is a quarterback completing a pass\".",

        "2007).",
        "Like DART, we make use of a dependency parser instead of partial parsing.",
        "So we capture phrase heads instead complete phrases.",
        "The main differences between the generation of our BKB and the generation of DART are:",
        "1.",
        "We use the dependencies involving copulative verbs as a source of evidence for \"is\" and \"has-instance\" relations.",
        "2.",
        "Instead of replacing proper nouns by \"person\", \"place\", or \"organization\", we consider all of them just as instances in our BKB.",
        "Furthermore, when a proposition contains a proper noun, we count it twice: one as the original proposition instance, and a second replacing the proper nouns with a generic tag indicating that there was a name.",
        "3.",
        "We make use of the modifiers that involve an instance (proper noun) to add counting to the \"has-instance\" relation.",
        "4.",
        "Instead of replacing pronouns by \"person\" or \"thing\", we replace them by \"person\", \"group\" or \"thing\", taking advantage of the preposition number.",
        "This is particular useful for the domain of football where players and teams are central.",
        "5.",
        "We add a new set of propositions that relate two clauses in the same sentence (e.g.,",
        "Floyd:break:takle:add:touchdown).",
        "We",
        "tagged these propositions NVV, NVNV,",
        "NVVN and NVNVN.",
        "6.",
        "Instead of an unrestricted domain collection, we consider documents closely related to the domain in which we want to interpret texts.",
        "The consideration of a specific domain collection seems a very powerful option.",
        "Ambiguity is reduced inside a domain so the counting for propositions is more robust.",
        "Also frequency distribution of propositions is different from one domain into another.",
        "For example, the list of the most frequent NVN propositions in our BKB (see Section 3.1) is, by itself, an indication of the most salient and important events in the American football domain.",
        "The task of inferring omitted but necessary information is a significant part of automated text interpretation.",
        "In this paper we show that even simple kinds of information, gleaned relatively straightforwardly from a parsed corpus, can be quite useful.",
        "Though they are still lexical and not even starting to be semantic, propositions consisting of verbs as relations between nouns seem to provide a surprising amount of utility.",
        "It remains a research problem to determine what kinds and levels of knowledge are most useful in the long run.",
        "In the paper, we discuss only the propositions that are grounded in instantial statements about players and events.",
        "But for true learning by reading, a system has to be able to recognize when the input expresses general rules, and to formulate such input as axioms or inferences.",
        "In addition, augmenting that is the significant challenge of generalizing certain kinds of instantial propositions to produce inferences.",
        "At which point, for example, should the system decide that \"all football players have teams\", and how should it do so?",
        "How to do so remains a topic for future work.",
        "A further topic of investigation is the time at which expansion should occur.",
        "Doing so at question time, in the manner of traditional task-oriented backchaining inference, is the obvious choice, but some limited amount of forward chaining at reading time seems appropriate too, especially if it can significantly assist with text processing tasks, in the manner of expectation-driven understanding.",
        "Finally, as discussed above, the evaluation of our reading augmentation procedures remains to be developed."
