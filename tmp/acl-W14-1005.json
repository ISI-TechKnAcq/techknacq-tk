        "grammar may contain rules in which a complete multi-word verb translation is captured in a single discontiguous rule, in practice many verb translations are incompletely or inconsistently produced.",
        "There are many routes by which ill-formed constructions come to be licensed by the model, none of which is easy to address.",
        "For instance, Figure 1 shows an example from our training data in which a missing alignment link (between has and ist) allows the extraction of rules that translate has failed to the incomplete fehlgeschlagen.",
        "Even with perfect word alignments, the extracted rules may not include sufficient context to ensure the overall grammaticality of a derivation.",
        "The extent of this problem will depend partly on the original treebank annotation style, which typically will not have been designed with translation in mind.",
        "The problem may be further exacerbated by errors during automatic parsing.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem by focusing on the derivation process.",
        "We extend a strong SCFG-based string-to-tree model to incorporate a rich feature-structure based representation 21 of German verbal complex types.",

        "By developing model features that use source-side information to influence the production of verbal complexes we are able to substantially improve the type accuracy as compared to the reference.",
        "2 Verbal Complex Structures Adopting the terminology of Gojun and Fraser (2012), we use the term ?verbal com-plex?",
        "to mean a main verb and any associated auxiliaries within a single clause.",
        "2.1 Feature Structures We use feature structures to represent the underlying grammatical properties of German verbal complexes.",
        "The feature structures serve two main functions: the first is to specify a type for the verbal complex.",
        "The types describe clause-level properties and are defined along four dimensions: 1. tense (present, past, perfect, pluperfect, future, future perfect), 2. voice (active, werden-passive, sein-passive), 3. mood (indicative, subjunctive I, subjunctive II), and 4. auxiliary modality (modal, non-modal).",
        "The second function is to restrict the choice of individual word forms that are allowed to combine within a given type.",
        "For example, a feature structure value for the verbal complex hat .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "gespielt belongs to the perfect, active, indica-tive, non-modal type.",
        "Additionally, it specifies that for this type, the verbal complex comprises exactly two verbs: one is a finite, indicative form of the auxiliary haben or sein, the other is a past-participle.",
        "2.2 The Lexicon Our model uses a lexicon that maps each German verb in the target-side terminal vocabulary to a set of features structures.",
        "Each feature structure contains two top-level features: POS, a part-of-speech feature, and VC, a verbal complex feature of the form described above.",
        "Since a verbal complex can comprise multiple individual verbs, the lexicon entries include partial VC structures.",

        "Every main verb is assigned VC values from one of three possible groups, selected according to whether the verb is finite, a past-participle, or an infinitive.",
        "For the closed class of modal and non-modal auxiliary verbs, VC values were manually assigned.",
        "3 The Grammar Our baseline translation model is learned from a parallel corpus with automatically-derived word alignments.",
        "In the literature, string-to-tree translation models are typically based on either synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) (as in Chiang et al. (2007)) or tree transducers (as in Galley et al. (2004)).",
        "In this work, we use an SCFG-based model but our extensions are applicable in both cases.",
        "Following Williams and Koehn (2011), each rule of our grammar is supplemented with a (possibly-empty) set of PATR-II-style identities (Shieber, 1984).",
        "Figure 2 shows two example rules with identities.",
        "The identities should be interpreted as constraints that the feature structures of the corresponding rule elements are compatible under unification.",
        "During decoding, this imposes a hard constraint on rule application.",

        "Grammar rule extraction is extended to generate identities between VC values when an SCFG rule contains two or more nodes from a common verbal complex.",
        "3.",
        "POS identities are added for terminals that appear in VC identities.",
        "Figure 3 shows a sentence-pair from the training data with the verbal complex highlighted.",
        "The rules in Figure 2 were extracted from this sentence-pair.",
        "Crucially, in step 2 of the extraction procedure the identities can be added to SCFG rules that cover only part of a verbal complex.",
        "For example, the first rule of Figure 2 includes the main verb but not the auxiliary.",
        "On application of this rule, the partial VC value is propagated from the main verb to the root.",
        "The second rule in Figure 2 identifies the VC value of an auxiliary with the VC value of a VP-OC subderivation (such as the subderivation produced by applying the first rule).",
        "4 Source-side Features Since Och and Ney (2002), most SMT models have been defined as a log-linear sum of weighted feature functions.",
        "In this section, we define two verbal-complex-specific feature functions.",
        "In order to do so, we first describe ?clause projection,?",
        "a simple source-syntactic restriction on decoding.",
        "We then describe our heuristic method of obtaining probability estimates for a target verbal complex value given the source clause.",
        "4.1 Clause Projection Our feature functions assume that we have an alignment from source-side clauses to target clauses.",
        "In order to satisfy this requirement, we adopt a simple restriction that declarative clauses (both main and embedded) on the source-side must be translated as clauses on the target-side.",
        "This is clearly an over-simplification from a linguistic perspective but it appears not to harm translation quality in practice.",

        "The input sentence is parsed and a set of clause spans is extracted according to the 1-best parse.",

        "2.",
        "We modify the decoder to produce derivations in chart cells only if the cell span is consistent with the set of clause spans (i.e. if source span [i,j] is a clause span then no derivation is built over span [m,n] where i < m ?",
        "j and n > j, etc.)",

        "We modify the decoder so that grammar rules can only be applied over clause spans if they have a clause label (?S?",
        "or ?CS?, since the parser we use is trained on the Tiger tree-bank).",
        "4.2 Verbal Complex Probabilities When translating a clause, the source-side verbal complex will often provide sufficient information to select a reasonable type for the target verbal complex, or to give preferences to a few candidates.",
        "By matching up source-side and target-side verbal complexes we estimate co-occurrence frequencies in the training data.",
        "To do this for all pairs in the training data, we would need to align clauses between the source and target training sentences.",
        "However, it is not crucial that we identify 23 every last verbal complex and so we simplify the task by restricting training data to sentence pairs in which both source and target sentences are declarative sentences, making the assumption that the main clause of the source sentence aligns with the main clause of the target.",
        "We represent source-side verbal complexes with a label that is the string of verbs and particles and their POS tags in the order that they occur in the clause, e.g. plays VBZ, is addressing VBZ VBG.",

        "Second, we expect the effects on BLEU score to become diluted as sentence length increases, for the simple reason that verbs are likely to account for a smaller proportion of the total number of words (though this effect seems to be small: in a parse of the newstest2009-30 subset, verbs account for 14.2% of tokens; in the full set they account for 13.1%).",
