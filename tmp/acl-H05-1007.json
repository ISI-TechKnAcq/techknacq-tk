        "Browsing through large volumes of spoken audio is known to be a challenging task for end users.",
        "One way to alleviate this problem is to allow users to gist a spoken audio document by glancing over a transcript generated through Automatic Speech Recognition.",
        "Unfortunately, such transcripts typically contain many recognition errors which are highly distracting and make gist-ing more difficult.",
        "In this paper we present an approach that detects recognition errors by identifying words which are semantic outliers with respect to other words in the transcript.",
        "We describe several variants of this approach.",
        "We investigate a wide range of evaluation measures and we show that we can significantly reduce the number of errors in content words, with the trade-off of losing some good content words."

        "Spoken audio documents are becoming more and more common place due to the rising popularity of technologies such as: video and audio conferencing, video web-casting and digital cameras for the consumer market.",
        "Unfortunately, speech documents are inherently hard to browse because of their transient nature.",
        "For example, imagine trying to locate the audio segment in the recording of a 60-minute meeting, where John talked about project X.",
        "Typically, this would require fast forwarding through the audio by some amount, then listening and trying to remember if the current segment was spoken before or after the desired segment, then fast-forwarding or backtracking by a small amount, and so on.",
        "One way to make audio browsing of audio documents more efficient is to allow the user to navigate through a textual transcript that is cross-referenced with corresponding time points into the original audio (Nakatani et al.",
        "1998; Hirschberg et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Such transcripts can easily be produced with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems today.",
        "Unfortunately, such transcripts typically contain recognition errors that make them hard to browse and understand.",
        "Although Word Error Rates (WER) of the order of 20% can be achieved for broadcast quality audio, the WER for more common situations (ex: less-than-broadcast quality recordings of meetings) is typically in the order of 50% or more.",
        "The work we present in this paper aims at automatically identifying recognition errors and removing them from the transcript, in order to make gisting and browsing of the corresponding audio more efficient.",
        "For example, consider the following portion of a transcript that was produced with the Dragon NaturallySpeaking speech recognition system from the audio of a meeting: “Weenie to decide quickly whether local for large expensive plasma screen aura for a bunch of smaller and cheaper ones and Holland together” Now consider the following filtered transcript where recognition errors were automatically blotted out using our proposed algorithm: “ ... to decide quickly whether ... large expensive plasma screen ... for a bunch of smaller and cheaper ones and ... together” We believe that transcripts like this second one may be more efficient for gisting and browsing the",
        "content of the original audio whose correct transcript is: “We need to decide quickly whether we will go for a large expensive plasma screen or for a bunch of smaller and cheaper ones and tile them together.” Our approach to filtering recognition errors is to identify semantic outliers.",
        "By this, we mean words that do not cohere well semantically with other words in the transcript.",
        "More often than not, such outliers turn out to be mistranscribed words.",
        "We present several variants of an algorithm for identifying semantic outliers, and evaluate them in terms of how well they are able to filter out recognition errors."

        "Some of these methods achieve good performance, although they use different test sets and report different evaluation measures from the set we enumerate in Section 6.",

        "The reason to ignore stopwords is that they tend to co-occur with most words, and are therefore semantically coherent with most words.",

        "Low values of K mean little error filtering and high values of K mean a lot of error filtering.",
        "We tested a number of variants of Steps 1-3.",
        "For Step 1, we experimented with two ways of computing the neighborhood N(w).",

        "The second neighborhood approach was to set N(w) to be the set of 10 content words before and after w in the transcript (the Window variant).",
        "For Step 2 we experimented with two different measures for evaluating the pairwise semantic similarities S(wi, wj).",
        "The first measure used a hand-crafted dictionary (the Roget variant) whereas the second one used a statistical measure based on a large corpus (the PMI variant).",
        "For Step 3 we experimented with different schemes for “aggregating” the pairwise semantic similarities S(wi, wj) into a single semantic coherence number SC(wi) for a given word wi.",
        "The first aggregation scheme was simply to average the SC(wi) values (the AVG variant).",

        "Semantic similarity refers to the degree with which two words (two concepts) are related.",
        "For example, most human judges would agree that paper and pencil are more closely related than car and toothbrush.",
        "We use the term semantic similarity in this paper in a more general sense of semantic relatedness (two concepts can be related by their context of use without necessarily being similar).",
        "There are three types of semantic similarity measures: dictionary-based (lexical taxonomy structure), corpus-based, and hybrid.",
        "Most of the dictionary-based measures use path length in WordNet – for example (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998).",
        "The corpus-based measures use some form of vector similarity.",
        "The cosine measure uses frequency counts in its vectors and cosine to compute similarity; the simpler methods use binary vectors and compute coefficients such as: Matching, Dice, Jaccard, and Overlap.",
        "Examples of hybrid measures, based on WordNet and small corpora, are: Resnik (1995), Jiang and Conrath (1997), Lin (1998).",
        "All dictionary-based measures have the disadvantage of limited coverage: they cannot deal with many proper names and new words that are not in the dictionary.",
        "For WordNet-based approaches, there is the additional issue that they tend to work well only for nouns because the noun hierarchy in WordNet is the most developed.",
        "Also, most of the WordNet-based measures do not work for words with different part-of-speech, with small exceptions such as the extended Lesk measure (Banerjee and Peder-sen, 2003).",
        "We did a pre-screening of the various semantic similarity measures in order to choose the one measure of each type (dictionary-based and corpus-based) that seemed most promising for our task of detecting semantic outliers in automatic speech transcripts.",
        "The dictionary-based approaches that we evaluated were: the WordNet-based measure by Leacock and Chodorow (1987), and one other dictionary-based measure that uses the Roget thesaurus.",
        "The Roget measure (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003) has the advantage that it works across part-of-speech.",
        "The corpus-based measures we evaluated were: (a) the cosine measure based on word co-occurrence vectors (Lesk, 1969), (b) a new method that computes the Pearson correlation coefficient of the co-occurrence vectors instead of the cosine, and (c) a measure based on point-wise mutual information.",
        "We computed the first two measures on the 100-million-words British National Corpus (BNC)1, and the third one on a much larger-corpus of Web data (one terabyte) accessed through the Waterloo Multitext system (Clarke and Terra, 2003).",
        "The reason for using corpora of different sizes is that PMI is the only",
        "one of the three corpus-based approaches that scales up to a terabyte corpus.",
        "We describe here in detail the PMI corpus-based measure, because it is the most important for this paper.",
        "The semantic similarity score between two words w1 and w2 is defined as the probability of seeing the two words together divided by the probability of each word separately: PMI(w1,w2) = log [P(w1,w2) / (P(w1)·P(w2))] = log [C(w1,w2)⋅N / (C(w1)⋅C(w2))], where C(w1,w2), C(w1), C(w2) are frequency counts, and N is the total number of words in the corpus.",
        "Such counts can easily and efficiently be retrieved for a terabyte corpus using the Waterloo Multitext system.",
        "In order to assess how well the semantic similarity measures correlate with human perception, we use the set of 30 word pairs of Miller and Charles (1991), and the 65 pairs of Rubenstein and Goode-nough (1965).",
        "Both used humans to judge the similarity.",
        "The Miller and Charles pairs were a subset of the Rubenstein and Goodenough pairs.",
        "Note that both of those sets were limited to nouns that appeared in the Roget thesaurus, and they are therefore favorably biased towards dictionary-based approaches.",
        "Table 1 shows the correlation of 5 similarity measures for the Rubenstein and Goodenough (R&G) and Miller and Charles (M&C) dataset.",
        "Note that although there are many WordNet-based semantic similarity measures, we only show correlations for Leacock and Chodorow (L&C) because it was previously shown to be better correlated (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003).",
        "We do not show figures for hybrid measures either because the same study showed L&C to be better.",
        "We see that the WordNet-based L&C measure based (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998 and the Roget measure (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003) both achieve high correlations but the two vector corpus-based measures (Cosine and Pearson Correlation) achieve much lower correlation.",
        "The only corpus-based measure that does well is PMI, probably because of the much larger corpus.",
        "We decided to experiment with two of the measures (one corpus-based and one thesaurus based) for computing the semantic similarity of word pairs in Step 2 of the algorithm described in Section 3.",

        "We plan to explore more approaches to detecting semantic outliers, for example clustering or lexical chains (Hirst and St-Onge, 1997).",
        "The most promising direction is to combine our method with confidence measures that use internal information from the ASR system (although the internal information is hard to obtain when using an ASR as a black box, and it could be recognizer-specific).",
        "A combination is likely to improve the performance, with the PMI-based measure contributing at the high-Precision end and the internal ASR measure contributing to the high-Recall end of the spectrum.",
        "To increase Recall we can also identify named entities and not filter them out.",
        "Some named entities could have high semantic similarity with the text if they are frequently mentioned in the same contexts in the Web corpus, but some names could be common to many contexts.",
        "Another future direction will be to actually correct the errors instead of just filtering them out.",
        "For example, we might look at the top N speech recognizer hypotheses (for a fairly large N like 1000) and choose the one that maximizes semantic cohesion.",
        "A final direction for research is to conduct experiments with human subjects, to evaluate the degree to which filtered transcripts are better than unfiltered ones for tasks like browsing, gisting and searching audio clips."
