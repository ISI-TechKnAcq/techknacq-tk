        "It is an important issue to identify predicates in syntactic analysis.",
        "In general, a predicate is considered the head of a sentence.",
        "In Chinese, it usually organizes two parts into a well-formed sentence, one with a subject and its adjunct, and the other with an object and/or complement (Luo et al., 1994).",
        "Accurate identification of predicate head is thus critical in determining the syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "Moreover, a predicate head splitting a long sentence into two shorter parts can alleviate the complexity of syntactic analysis to a certain degree.",
        "This is particularly useful when long dependency relations are involved.",
        "Without doubt, this is also a difficult task in Chinese dependency parsing (Cheng et al., 2005).",
        "Predicate head identification also plays an important role in facilitating various tasks of natural language processing.",
        "For example, it enhances shallow parsing (Sun et al., 2000) and head-driven parsing (Collins, 1999), and also improves the precision of sentence similarity computation (Sui et al., 1998a).",
        "There is reason to expect it to be more widely applicable to other tasks, e.g. machine translation, information extraction, and question answering.",
        "In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically recognize predicate heads of Chinese sentences based on a preprocessing step for maximal noun phrases 1(MNPs).",
        "MNPs usually appear in the location of subject and object in a sentence.",
        "The proper identification of them is thus expected to assist the analysis of sentence structure and/or improve the accuracy of predicate head recognition.",
        "In the next section, we will first review some related works and discuss their limitations, followed by a detailed description of the task of recognizing predicate heads in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 illustrates our proposed approach and Section 5 presents experiments and results.",

        "These traditional approaches only make use of the static and dynamic grammatical features of the quasi-predicates to identify the predicate heads.",
        "On this basis, Li and Meng (2005) proposed a method to further utilize syntactic relations between the subject and the predicate in a sentence.",
        "Besides the above monolingual proposals, Sui and Yu (1998a) discussed a bilingual strategy to recognize predicate heads in Chinese sentences with reference to those in their counterpart English sentences.",
        "Nevertheless, these methods have their own limitations.",
        "The rule-based methods require effective linguistic rules to be formulated by linguists according to their own experience.",
        "Certainly, this is impossible to cover all linguistic situations concerned, due to the complexity of language and the limitations of human observation.",
        "In practice, we also should not underestimate the complexity of feature application, the computing power demanded and the difficulties in handing irregular sentence patterns.",
        "For instance, a sentence without subject may lead to an incorrect recognition of predicate head.",
        "For corpus-based approaches, they rely on language data in huge size but the available data may not be adequate.",
        "Those bilingual methods may first encounter the difficulty of determining correct sentence alignment in the case that the parallel data consist of much free translation.",
        "Our method proposed here focuses on a simple but effective means to help identify predicate heads, i.e., MNP pre-processing.",
        "At present, there has some substantial progress in automatic recognition of MNP.",

        "The challenge of accurate identification of predicate heads is to resolve the problem of quasi-predicate heads in a sentence.",

        "Each of them may have multiple instances in a sentence.",
        "On the other hand, while a simple sentence has only one predicate head, a complex sentence may have multiple ones.",
        "The latter constitutes 8.25% in our corpus.",
        "Thus, the real difficulty lies in how to recognize the true predicate head of a sentence among so many possibilities.",
        "The quasi-predicate heads (verbs and adjectives) include l/v, #X/a, X/a, Sl/v, ^}f/v, and fyS/v.",
        "However, there are two MNPs in this sentence, namely, \"S/rN f+/qN l/v #X /a li/n W/uJDE X/a 4/n\" and \"ÄWaD W/uJDE £ü/v X/n ft/cC füiä/v X/n\".",
        "These two MNPs cover most quasi-predicate heads in the sentence, except Sl/v, the true predicate head that we want.",
        "An MNP is a complete semantic unit, and its internal structure may include different kinds of constituents (Jian et al., 2009).",
        "Therefore, the fundamental structure of a sentence can be made clear after recognizing its MNPs.",
        "This can help filter out those wrong quasi-predicates for a better shortlist of good candidates for the true predicate head in a sentence.",
        "In practice, the identification of predicate head begins with recognizing MNPs in the same sentence.",
        "It turns the above example sentence into: [ S/rN #/qN l/v #X/a Ä/n W /uJDE X/a 4/n ] Sl/v [ £^/aD W/uJDE £ü/v X/n WcC fuS/v X /n ] o/wE",
        "These MNPs are then replaced with the conventional label \"NP\" for noun phrase, resulting in a simplified sentence structure as follows.",
        "NP/NP Sl/v NP/NP o /wE This basic sentence structure can largely alleviates the complexity of the original sentence and narrows down the selection scope of quasi-predicates for the true head.",
        "In this particular example, the only verb left in the sentence after MNP recognition is the true predicate head."
