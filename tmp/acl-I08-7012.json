        "In this paper, we first had a overall study of existing POS tag sets for European and Indian languages.",
        "Till now, most of the research done on POS tagging is for English.",
        "We observed that even though the research on POS tagging for English is done exhaustively, part-of-speech annotation in various research applications is incomparable which is variously due to the variations in tag set definitions.",
        "We understand that the morpho-syntactic features of the language and the degree of desire to represent the granularity of these morpho-syntactic features, domain etc., decide the tags in the tag set.",
        "We then examined how POS tagset design has to be handled for Indian languages, taking Telugu language into consideration."

        "Annotation is the process of adding some additional information (grammatical features like word category, case indicator, other morph features) about the word to each word of the text.",
        "This additional information is called a tag.",
        "The set of all these tags is called a tag set.",
        "When words are considered in isolation, they can have one or more number of tags for each word.",
        "But when these words are used in a certain context, the tags representing morphological and syntactic feature reduce to one tag.",
        "The information to be captured as a tag is an application specific issue (Anne,1997, David, 1994 and David, 1995).",
        "A number of tag sets have been evolved for a number of languages.",
        "These tag sets not only differ with each other from language to language, but vary within the language itself.",
        "The reasons for the variation of tags in the tag sets are as follows.",
        "As taggers give additional information like grammatical features such as number, gender, person, case markers for noun inflections; tense markers for verbal inflections, the number of tags used by different systems varies depending on the information encoded in the tag.",
        "However the tag set design plays a vital role when data is tagged according to it and hence it affects the development of NLP application tools within and across that language.",
        "Language independent representation of a tag set help to find out the hidden information like context, structure, syntactic and semantic aspect of the word.",

        "Unfortunately, there does not seem to be much literature on standard tag set design.",
        "There is a need to have standard tag set labels for the words to encode the same linguistic information across the languages.",
        "The tag set labels of a given language should satisfy the following characteristics.",
        "(1) The words carrying same syntactic, categorical information should be grouped under the same tag.",
        "For example, all adjectives should be tagged as JJ.",

        "Engineering Tirupati",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "(2) The words which have same syntax and come under different categories should clearly be distinguished depending on the categorical sense in which it is used in the given context.",
        "For example, the word book can be tagged both as noun (NN) and Verb (VB).",
        "(3) The tag set should also help us to classify and predict the sense, category of the unknown and foreign words.",
        "For example, consider the sentence, \"Give it to xyxxy\", POS tagger should be in a position to predict xyxxy (or any nonsensical string) could be a noun."

        "After a careful study, the following points were observed with regard to the differences in POS tag sets.",
        "(i) Desire to capture more semantic content:",
        "BC, ICE, URCEL tag set are making more subtle distinctions within one category than PT.",
        "For example, POS tags for adjectives-PT is not making any clear distinction for adjectives other than JJ, JJS, JJR, whereas other tag sets are maintaining fine granularity.",
        "Such differences can be observed for several morpho-syntactic features.",
        "(ii) Corpus Coverage: Depending on the syntactic distribution of the test corpus under consideration, there may be variations.",
        "For example, BC tag set made a wide provision for foreign words (not shown in the above table).",
        "In British corpus, there may be a possibility of the presence of the test corpus where more number of words are borrowed from other languages into English.",
        "(iii) Desire for precision: The reason for more number of tags in a tag set is to precisely capture all linguistic criteria which describe morpho-syntactic features in detail.",
        "However, there should be a balance between theoretical and actual distribution of these syntactic features."
