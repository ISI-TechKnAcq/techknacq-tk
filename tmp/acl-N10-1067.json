        "A number of recent articles in computational linguistics venues called for a closer examination of the type of noise present in annotated datasets used for benchmarking (Rei-dsma and Carletta, 2008; Beigman Klebanov and Beigman, 2009).",
        "In particular, Beigman Klebanov and Beigman articulated a type of noise they call annotation noise and showed that in worst case such noise can severely degrade the generalization ability of a linear classifier (Beigman and Beigman Klebanov, 2009).",

        "Traditionally, studies in computational linguistics use few trained annotators.",
        "Lately this might be changing, as inexpensive annotators are available in large numbers through projects like Amazon Mechanical Turk or through online games where annotations are produced as a by-product (Poesio et al., 2008; von Ahn, 2006), and, at least for certain tasks, the quality of multiple non-expert annotations is close to that of a small number of experts (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "Apart from the reduced costs, mass annotation is a promising way to get detailed information about the dataset, such as the level of difficulty of the difference instances.",
        "Such information is important both from the linguistic and from the machine learning perspective, as the existence of a group of instances difficult enough to look like they have been labeled by random guesses can in the worst case induce the machine learner training on the dataset to misclassify a constant proportion of easy, non-controversial instances, as well as produce incorrect comparative results in a benchmarking setting (Beigman Klebanov and Beigman, 2009; Beigman and Beigman Klebanov, 2009) .",
        "In this article, we employ annotation generation models to estimate the types of instances in a multiply annotated dataset for a binary classification task.",
        "We provide the first quantitative empirical demonstration, to our knowledge, of the existence of what Beigman Klebanov and Beigman (2009) call \"annotation noise\" in a benchmarked dataset, that is, for a case where instances cannot be plausibly assigned to just two classes, and where instances in the third class can be plausibly described as having been annotated by flips of a nearly fair coin.",
        "The ability to identify such instances helps improve the gold standard by eliminating them, and allows further empirical investigation of their impact on machine learning for the task in question."

        "The basic idea is that there are different types of instances that induce different responses from annotators.",
        "Each instance may have a true label of \"0\" or \"1\", however, the researcher's access to it is mediated by annotators who are guessing the true label by flipping a coin, where the bias of the coin depends on the type of the instance.",
        "The bias of the coin essentially models the difficulty of labeling the instance; coins biased close to 0 and 1 correspond to instances that are easy to classify; a fair coin represents instances that are very difficult if not impossible to classify correctly with the given pool of annotators.",
        "The model presented in Beigman Klebanov and Beigman (2009) is a special case with 3 types (A,B,C) where pa=Q, Pc=1 (easy cases), and 0<Pb<1 represents the hard cases, the harder the closerps is to 0.5.",
        "Models used here are atype of latent class models (McCutcheon, 1987) widely used in the Biometrics community (Espeland and Handel-man, 1989; Yang and Becker, 1997; Albert et al., 2001; Albert and Dodd, 2004).",
        "The goal of modeling is to determine whether more than two types of instances need to be postulated, to estimate how difficult each type is, and to identify the troublemaking instances.",
        "The graphical model is presented in figure 1.",
        "We assume the dataset of size N is a mixture of k different types of instances.",
        "The proportion of types is given by 0 = ..., 9k), and coin biases for each type are given by p = {p\\,..., pu).",
        "Each instance is annotated by n i.i.d coinflips, and random variable x g {0,..., n} counts the number of \"l\"s in the n annotations given to an instance.",
        "Each instance belongs to a type t e {1, ...,k}, characterized by a coin with the probability pt of annotating with the label \"1\".",

        "For the experiments reported here we use the 800 item test data of the first Recognizing Textual Entailment benchmark (RTE-1) from Dagan et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "This task drew a lot of attention in the community, with a series of benchmarks in 2005-2007.",
        "The task is defined as follows: \"... textual entailment is defined as a directional relationship between pairs of text expressions, denoted by T - the entailing \"Text\", and H - the entailed \"Hypothesis\".",
        "We say that T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T, as would typically be interpreted by people.",
        "This somewhat informal definition is based on (and assumes) common human understanding of language as well as common background knowledge\" (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Further guidelines included an instruction to disregard tense differences, to accept cases where the inference is \"very probable (but not completely certain)\" and to avoid cases where the inference \"has some positive probability that is not clearly very high.\"",
        "An example of a true entailment is the pair T-H: (T) Cavern Club sessions paid the Beatles £15 evenings and £5 lunchtime.",
        "(H) The Beatles perform at Cavern.",

        "The guidelines for Turkers are somewhat different from the original, not mentioning the issue of highly probable though not certain inference or a special treatment of tense mismatch between H and T, as well as discouraging reliance on background knowledge.",
        "Using Snow et al.",
        "(2008) instructions, we collected 20 annotations for each of the 800 items through AMT from the total of 441 annotators.",
        "Each annotator did the minimum of 2 items, and was paid $0.01 for 2 items, for the total annotator cost of $80.",
        "We used only annotators with prior AMT approval rate of at least 95%, that is, only people whose performance in previous tasks on AMT was almost always approved by the requester of the task.",
        "Our design is thus somewhat different from Snow et al.",
        "(2008), as we paid more and selected annotators with a stake in their AMT reputation.",
        "We collected the annotations in two separate batches of 10 annotations per item, using the same set of instructions, incentives, and examples.",
        "We hypothesized that controlling for these elements, we would get two random samples from the same distribution of Turkers, and hence will have two samples to make sure a model fitted on one sample generalized to the other.",
        "It turned out, however, that a 3-Binomial model with a good fit on one of the samples was rejected with high probability for the other.",
        "Thus, on the one hand, the variations between annotators in each sample were not as high as to preclude a model that captures only instance variability from fitting well; on the other hand, evidently, the two samples did not come from the same annotator distribution, but differed systematically due to factors we did not control for.",
        "In order for our models not to inherit a systematic bias of any of the two samples, we mixed the two samples, and constructed two sets, BRTEa and BRTEb, each with 10 annotations per item, by randomly splitting the 20 answers per item into two groups, allowing the same annotator to contribute to different groups on different instances.",

        "Since 0 < xj < n it follows that E(xj), Var(xj) < oo for j = 1,..., N. If for each instance the coin-flips are independent, we can think of this as a two step process where we first draw the coins and then flip them.",

        "Supposing the main source of misfit is difference in incentives, we conjecture that the difference between the 441 BRTE annotators and the 164 SRTE ones is due to the existence in SRTE of unmotivated, or \"lazy\" annotators, that is, people who flipped the same coin on every instance, no matter what type.",

        "A more precise statement is that there are about one-fifth lazy potential annotators in the SRTE pool for any given item.",
        "It is possible that the length of stay of an annotator in the pool is not independent of her diligence; for example, Callison-Burch (2009) found in his AMT experiments with tasks related to machine translation that lazy annotators tended to stay longer and do more annotations.",

        "The current literature on generating benchmarking data from AMT annotations overwhelmingly considers annotator heterogeneity as the source of observed discrepancies, with instances falling into two classes only.",
        "Our results suggest that, at least in RTE data, instance heterogeneity cannot be ignored.",
        "It also transpired that small variations in incentives (as between SRTE and BRTE), and even unknown factors possibly related to differences in the composition of AMT's workforce can lead to systematic differences in the resulting annotator pools, which results in annotations that are described by models with somewhat different parameter values.",
        "This can potentially limit the usefulness of our main finding, because it is not clear how reliable the identification of hard cases is using any particular group of Turkers.",
        "While this is a valid concern in general, we show in section 7.1 that many items consistently found to be hard by different groups of Turkers warrant at least an additional examination, as they often represent borderline cases of highly or not-so-highly probable inferences, corruption of meaning by ungrammaticality, or difficulties related to the treatment of time references and background knowledge.",
        "Finally, our findings seem to be at odds with the fact that the 800 items analyzed here were left after all items on which two experts disagreed and all items that looked controversial to the arbiter were removed (see section 3).",
        "One potential explanation is that things that are hard for Turkers are not necessarily hard for experts.",
