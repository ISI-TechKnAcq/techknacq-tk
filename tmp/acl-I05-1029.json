        "One generally accepted hallmark of creative thinking is an ability to look beyond conventional labels and recategorize a concept based on its behaviour and functional potential.",
        "So while taxonomies are useful in any domain of reasoning, they typically represent the conventional label set that creative thinking attempts to look beyond.",
        "So if a linguistic taxonomy like WordNet [1] is to be useful in driving linguistic creativity, it must support some basis for recate-gorization, to allow an agent to reorganize its category structures in a way that unlocks the functional potential of objects, or that recognizes similarity between literally dissimilar ideas.",
        "In this paper we consider how recategorization can be used to generate analogies using the HowNet [2] ontology, a lexical resource like WordNet that in addition to being bilingual (Chinese/English) also provides explicit semantic definitions for each of the terms that it defines."

        "Analogy is a knowledge-hungry process that exploits a conceptual system's ability to perform controlled generalization in one domain and re-specialization into another.",
        "The result is a taxonomic leap within an ontology that transfers semantic content from one term onto another.",
        "While all taxonomies allow vertical movement, a system must fully understand the effects of generalization on a given concept before any analogy or metaphor can be considered either deliberate or meaningful.",
        "So to properly support analogy, a taxonomy must provide a basis of abstracting not just to conventional categories, like Person, Animal or Tool, but to categories representing the specific causal behaviour of concepts such as think-agent, pain-experiencer, cutting-instrument, and so on.",
        "Thus, a surgeon can be meaningfully described as a repairman since both occupations have the function of restoring an object to an earlier and better state; a footballer can be meaningfully described as a gladiator or a warrior since each exhibits competitive behaviour; and a scalpel can be compared to a sabre, a sword or a cleaver since each has a cutting behaviour; and so on.",
        "Theories of metaphor and analogy are typically based either on structure-mapping [3,4] or on abstraction e.g., [5,6,7,8,9,10]).",
        "While the former is most associated with analogy, the latter has been a near-constant in the computational treatment of metaphor.",
        "Structure-mapping assumes that the causal behaviour of a concept is expressed in an explicit, graph-theoretic form so that unifying sub-graph isomorphisms can be",
        "Analogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstraction with HowNet Semantics 327",
        "found between different representations.",
        "In contrast, abstraction theories assume that analogous concepts, even when far removed in ontological terms, will nonetheless share a common hypernym that captures their causal similarity.",
        "Thus, we should expect an analogous pairing like surgeon and butcher to have different immediate hy-pernyms but to ultimately share an abstraction like cutting-agent (see [8,9]).",
        "However, the idea that a standard ontology will actually provide a hypernym like cutting-agent seems convenient almost to the point of incredulity.",
        "The problem is, of course, that as much as we want our ontologies to anticipate future analogies and metaphors with these proactive categorizations, most ontologies simply do not possess terms as prescient as these.",
        "This is the question we address in this paper: if we assume that our ontologies lack these structures, can we nonetheless enable them to be added via automatic means?",
        "We argue that we can, by generalizing not on the basis of a concept's taxonomic position but on the basis of the specific relations that define its causal behaviour.",
        "Clearly then, this approach to analogy requires a resource that is rich in causal relations.",
        "We find this richness in HowNet [2, 11], a bilingual lexical ontology for Chinese and English that employs an explicit propositional semantics to define each of its lexical concepts.",
        "With this goal in mind, the paper observes the following structure: in section two we offer a concise survey of the considerable research that has, in the past, been dedicated to abstraction theories of analogy and metaphor.",
        "In section three we then compare and contrast WordNet [1] and HowNet as candidate resources for the current abstraction approach to analogical reasoning.",
        "In section four, having established an argument as to why HowNet is to be preferred, we indicate how HowNet's semantic definitions can be transformed in the service of analogical recategorization.",
        "The performance and competence of this recategorization ability is then evaluated in section five.",
        "Speculation about further possible contributions of HowNet to analogical research is reserved for the closing remarks of section six."

        "That analogy and metaphor operate across multiple levels of conceptual abstraction has been well known since classical times.",

        "While the core idea has survived relatively unchanged, one must discriminate theories that apparently presume a static type-hierarchy to be sufficient for all abstraction purposes (e.g., [6]), from theories that posit the need for a dynamic type hierarchy (e.g., [7, 8]).",
        "One must also differentiate theories that have actually been implemented (e.g., [6,8,9]) from those that are either notional or that seem to court computational intractability (e.g., [5,6]).",
        "Perhaps most meaningfully, one must differentiate theories and implementations that assume hand-crafted, purpose-built ontologies (e.g., [6]) from those that exploit an existing large-scale resource like WordNet (e.g., [8,9]).",
        "In the former, one has the flexibility to support as many functional abstractions like cutting-agent as are believed necessary, but at the cost of appearing to anticipate future analogies by hand-crafting them into the system.",

        "Analysis of the WordNet gloss for {Athena} suggests that the word-form \"wisdom\" has analogical potential, since it is alignable with another use in {Ganesh}.",

        "This current work follows the latter course.",
        "We intend to automatically construct a new taxonomy of analogically-useful abstractions like cutting-agent, by analysing the semantic content of the definitions assigned to each word-sense in HowNet.",
        "Past work (e.g., [8]) has attempted this automatic construction of analogically-friendly taxonomies from WordNet, resulting in an approach that involves as much information-extraction from free text as it does semantic inference.",
        "This is because WordNet's glosses, unlike the semantic definitions of HowNet, are free-form sentences designed for human, rather than machine, consumption.",
        "For instance, Figure 1 above illustrates how features can be lifted from WordNet glosses to create new intermediate taxonyms, or dynamic types, from which subsequent abstraction-based analogies can be generated.",
        "The explicitly-structured semantic forms that one finds in HowNet definitions will clearly make this lifting of features more logical and less heuristic.",

        "Generalization can be considered \"controlled\" if, when moving to a higher level of abstraction in a taxonomy, a conceptual system is able to precisely quantify that meaning which is lost.",
        "In this sense at least, most large-scale taxonomies do not provide a significant degree of control.",
        "Perhaps nowhere is this observation more keenly felt than in weak lexical ontologies like Princeton WordNet (PWN).",
        "In PWN [1], generalization of a concept/synset does not generally yield a functional or behavioural abstraction of the original concept.",
        "This is so because WordNet's taxonomy is designed not to capture common causality, function and behaviour, but to show how existing lexemes relate to each other.",
        "For example, the common abstraction that unites {surgeon, sawbones} and {tree_surgeon} is not a concept that captures a shared sense of repair, improvement or care, but {person, human}.",
        "To be fair, much the same must be said of other taxonomies, even that of HowNet [2,11], a Chinese/English semantic dictionary, and Cyc [12].",
        "However, as we shall demonstrate, HowNet contains the necessary basis for such abstractions in its relational semantic definitions.",
        "PWN and HowNet have each been designed according a different theory of semantic organization.",
        "PWN is differential is nature: rather than attempting to express the meaning of a word explicitly, PWN instead differentiates words with different meanings by placing them in different synsets, and further differentiates synsets from one another by assigning them to different positions in its ontology.",
        "In contrast, HowNet is constructive in nature, exploiting sememes from a less discriminating taxonomy than PWN's to compose a semantic representation of meaning for each word sense.",
        "Nonetheless, HowNet compensates strongly with its constructive semantics.",
        "For example, HowNet assigns the concept surgeon the following definition:",
        "{humanlAHostOf={Occupation | lKfi},domain={medical | g}, {doctor I E :agent={~}}} which can be glossed thus: \"a surgeon is a human with an occupation in the medical domain who acts as the agent of a doctoring activity.\"",
        "The {~} serves as a self-reference here, to mark the location of the concept being defined in the given semantic structure.",
        "The oblique reference offered by the tilde construct serves to make the definition more generic (thereby facilitating analogy), so that many different concepts can conceivably employ the same definition.",
