        "Social QA sites are the ideal vehicle to investigate such questions.",
        "Questions posted on these sites typically have a correct answer that is selected manually by users.",
        "Assuming that all the other candidate answers are incorrect (we discuss this assumption in Section 5), it is trivial to automatically organize these data into a format ready for discriminative learning, namely, the pair question-correct answer generates one positive example and all other answers for the same question are used to generate negative examples.",
        "This allows one to use the collection in a completely automated manner to learn answer ranking models.",
        "The contributions of our investigation are the following:",
        "1.",
        "We introduce and evaluate many linguistic features for answer re-ranking.",
        "Although several of these features have been introduced in previous work, some are novel in the QA context, for example, syntactic dependencies and semantic role dependencies with words generalized to semantic tags.",
        "Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that combines all these features into a single framework.",
        "This allows us to investigate their comparative performance in a formal setting.",
        "2.",
        "We propose a simple yet powerful representation for complex linguistic features, that is, we model syntactic and semantic information as bags of syntactic dependencies or semantic role dependencies and build similarity and translation models over these representations.",
        "To address sparsity, we incorporate a back-off approach by adding additional models where lexical elements in these structures are generalized to semantic tags.",
        "These models are not only simple to build, but, as our experiments indicate, they perform at least as well as complex, dedicated models such as tree kernels.",
        "3.",
        "We are the first to evaluate the impact of such linguistic features in a large-scale setting that uses real-world noisy data.",
        "The impact on QA of some of the features we propose has been evaluated before, but these experiments were either on editorialized data enhanced with gold semantic structures (e.g., the Wall Street Journal corpus with semantic roles from PropBank [Bilotti et al.",
        "2007]), or on very few questions (e.g., 413 questions from TREC 12 [Cui et al.",

        "Approach",
        "Figure 1 illustrates our QA architecture.",
        "The processing flow is the following.",
        "First, the answer retrieval component extracts a set of candidate answers A for a question Q from a large collection of answers, C, provided by a community-generated question-answering site.",
        "The retrieval component uses a state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) model to extract A given Q.",
        "The second component, answer ranking, assigns to each answer Ai e A a score that represents the likelihood that Ai is a correct answer for Q, and ranks all answers in descending order of these scores.",
        "In our experiments, the collection C contains all answers previously selected by users of a social QA site as best answers for non-factoid questions of a certain type (e.g., \"How to\" questions).",
        "The entire collection of questions, Q, is split into a training set and two held-out sets: a development one used for parameter tuning, and a testing one used for the formal evaluation.",
        "Our architecture follows closely the architectures proposed in the TREC QA track (see, e.g., Voorhees 2001).",
        "For efficiency reasons, most participating systems split the answer extraction phase into a retrieval phase that selected likely answer snippets using shallow techniques, followed by a (usually expensive) answer ranking phase that processes only the candidates proposed by the retrieval component.",
        "Due to this separation, such architectures can scale to collections of any size.",
        "We discuss in Section 6 how related work has improved this architecture further â for example, by adding query expansion terms from the translation models back to answer retrieval (Riezler et al.",
        "2007).",
        "The focus of this work, however, is on the re-ranking model implemented in the answer ranking component.",
        "We call this model FMIX â from feature mix â because the proposed scoring function is a linear combination of four different classes of features"

        "To accommodate and combine all these feature classes, our QA approach combines three types of machine learning methodologies (as highlighted in Figure 1): the answer retrieval component uses unsupervised IR models, the answer ranking is implemented using discriminative learning, and finally, some of the ranking features are produced by question-to-answer translation models, which use class-conditional generative learning.",
        "To our knowledge, this combined approach is novel in the context of QA.",
        "In the remainder of the article, we will use the FMIX function to answer the research objectives outlined in the Introduction.",
        "To answer the first research objective we will compare the quality of the rankings provided by this component against the rankings generated by the IR model used for answer retrieval.",
        "To answer the second research objective we will analyze the contribution of the proposed feature set to this function.",
        "We make some simplifying assumptions in this study.",
        "First, we will consider only manner questions, and in particular only \"How to\" questions.",
        "This makes the corpus more homogeneous and more focused on truly informational questions (as opposed to social questions such as \"Why don't girls like me?",
        "\", or opinion questions such as \"Who will win the next election?",
        "\", both of which are very frequent in Yahoo!",
        "Answers).",
        "Second, we concentrate on the task of answer-re-ranking, and ignore all other modules needed in a complete on-line social QA system.",
        "For example, we ignore the problem of matching questions to questions, very useful when retrieving answers in a FAQ or a QA collection (Jeon, Croft, and Lee 2005), and we ignore all \"social\" features such as the authority of users (Jeon et al.",
        "2006; Agichtein et al.",
        "2008).",
        "Instead, we concentrate on matching answers and on the different textual features.",
        "Hence, the document collection used in our experiments contains only answers, without the corresponding questions answered.",
        "Furthermore, we concentrate on the re-ranking phase and we do not explore techniques to improve the recall of the initial retrieval phase (by methods of query expansion, for example).",
        "Such aspects are complementary to our work, and can be investigated separately.",
        "2.1 Representations of Content",
        "One of our main interests in using very large data sets was to show that complex linguistic features can improve ranking models if they are correctly combined with simpler features, in particular using discriminative learning methods on a particular task.",
        "For this reason we explore several forms of textual representation going beyond the bag of words.",
        "In particular, we generate our features over four different representations of text:",
        "Words (W): This is the traditional IR view where the text is seen as a bag of words.",
        "n-grams (N): The text is represented as a bag of word n-grams, where n ranges from two up to a given length (we discuss structure parameters in the following).",
        "Dependencies (D): The text is converted to a bag of syntactic dependency chains.",
        "We extract syntactic dependencies in the style of the CoNLL-2007 shared task using the syntactic processor described in Section 3.",

        "Sample syntactic dependencies and semantic tags.",
        "of Figure 2 shows a sample corpus sentence with the actual syntactic dependencies extracted by our syntactic processor.",
        "The figure indicates that this representation captures important syntactic relations, such as subject-verb (e.g., helicopter â > gets)orobject-verb (e.g., power â > gets).",
        "Semantic Roles (R): The text is represented as a bag of predicate-argument relations extracted using the semantic parser described in Section 3.",
        "The parser follows the PropBank notations (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), that is, it assigns semantic argument labels to nodes in a constituent-based syntactic tree.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example.",
        "The figure shows that the semantic proposition corresponding to the predicate gets includes A helicopter as the ArgO argument (ArgO stands for agent), its power as the Argl argument (or patient), and from rotors or blades as Arg2 (or instrument).",
        "Semantic roles have the advantage that they extract meaning beyond syntactic representations (e.g., a syntactic subject may be either an agent or a patient in the actual proposition).",
        "We convert the semantic propositions detected by our parser into semantic dependencies using the same approach as Surdeanu et al.",
        "(2008), that is, we create a semantic dependency between each predicate and the syntactic head of every one of its arguments.",
        "These dependencies are labeled with the label of the corresponding argument.",
        "For example, the semantic dependency that includes the ArgO argument in Figure 3 is represented as gets helicopter.",
        "If the syntactic constituent corresponding to a semantic argument is a prepositional phrase (PP), we convert it to a bigram that includes the preposition and the head word of the attached phrase.",
        "For example, the tuple for Arg2 in the example is represented as gets â â from-rotors.",
        "In all representations we remove structures where either one of the elements is a stop word and convert the remaining words to their WordNet lemmas.",
        "The structures we propose are highly configurable.",

        "Degree of lexicalization: We reduce the sparsity of the proposed structures by replacing the lexical elements with semantic tags which might provide better generalization.",
        "In this article we use two sets of tags, the first consisting of coarse WordNet senses, or supersenses (WNSS) (Ciaramita and Johnson 2003), and the second of named-entity labels extracted from the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "We present in detail the tag sets and the processors used to extract them in Section 3.",
        "For an overview, we show a sample annotated sentence in the bottom part of Figure 2.",
        "Labels of relations: Both dependency and predicate-argument relations can be labeled or unlabeled (e.g., gets helicopter versus gets â helicopter).",
        "We make this distinction in our experiments for two reasons: (a) removing relation labels reduces the model sparsity because fewer elements are created, and (b) performing relation recognition without classification is simpler than performing the two tasks, so the corresponding NL processors might be more robust in the unlabeled-relation setup.",
        "Structure size: This parameter controls the size of the generated structures, namely, number of words in n-grams or dependency chains, or number of elements in the predicate-argument tuples.",
        "Nevertheless, in our experiments we did not see any improvements from structure sizes larger than two.",
        "In the experiments reported in this article, all the structures considered are of size two, that is, we use bigrams, dependency chains of two elements, and tuples of one predicate and one semantic argument.",

        "For clarity, we group the features into four sets: features that model the similarity between questions and answers (FG1), features that encode question-to-answer transformations using a translation model (FG2), features that measure keyword density and frequency (FG3), and features that measure the correlation between question-answer pairs and other collections (FG4).",

        "Finally, we note that tree kernels provide minimal improvement: A tree kernel feature is selected only in iteration 20 and the MRR improvement is only 0.04 points.",

        "The table indicates that, regardless of the number of candidate answers for re-ranking (N), the number of improved questions is approximately twice the number of worsened questions.",
        "This explains the consistent improvements in P@1 and MRR measured for various values of N.As N increases, the number of questions that are improved also grows, which is an expected consequence of having more candidate answers to re-rank.",
        "However, the percentage of improved questions grows at a slightly lower rate than the percentage of worsened questions.",
        "This indicates that choosing the ideal number of candidate answers to rerank requires a trade-off: On the one hand, having more candidate answers increases the probability of capturing the correct answer in the set; on the other hand, it also increases the probability of choosing an incorrect answer due to the larger number of additional candidates.",
        "For our problem, it seems that re-ranking using values of N much larger than 100 would not yield significant benefits over smaller values of N. This analysis is consistent with the experiments reported in Table 3 where we did not measure significant growth in P@1 or MRR for N larger than 50.",
        "Although Table 7 gives the big picture of the behavior of our system, it is important to look at actual questions that are improved or worsened by the re-ranking model in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of our system.",

        "In this work we describe an answer ranking system for non-factoid questions built using a large community-generated question-answer collection.",
        "We show that the best ranking performance is obtained when several strategies are combined into a single model.",
        "We obtain the best results when similarity models are aggregated with features that model question-to-answer transformations, frequency and density of content, and correlation of QA pairs with external collections.",
        "Although the features that model question-to-answer transformations provide the most benefits, we show that the combination is crucial for improvement.",
        "Further, we show that complex linguistic features, most notably semantic role dependencies and semantic labels derived from WordNet senses, yield a statistically significant performance increase on top of the traditional bag-of-words and n-gram representations.",
        "We obtain these results using only off-the-shelf NL processors that were not adapted in any way for our task.",
        "As a side effect, our experiments prove that we can effectively exploit large amounts of available Web data to do research on NLP for non-factoid QA systems, without any annotation or evaluation cost.",
        "This provides an excellent framework for large-scale experimentation with various models that otherwise might be hard to understand or evaluate.",
        "As implications of our work, we expect the outcome of our investigation to help several applications, such as retrieval from social media and open-domain QA on the Web.",
        "On social media, for example, our system should be combined with a component that searches for similar questions already answered; the output of this ensemble can possibly be filtered further by a content-quality module that explores \"social\" features such as the authority of users, and so on.",
        "Although we do not experiment on Wikipedia or news sites in this work, one can view our data as a \"worse-case scenario,\" given its ungrammaticality and annotation quality.",
        "It seems reasonable to expect that training our model on cleaner data (e.g., from Wikipedia or news), would yield even better results.",
        "This work can be extended in several directions.",
        "First, answers that were not selected as best, but were marked as good by a minority of voters, could be incorporated in the training data, possibly introducing a graded notion of relevance.",
        "This would make the learning problem more interesting and would also provide valuable insights into the possible pitfalls of user-annotated data.",
        "It is not clear if more data, but of questionable quality, is beneficial.",
        "Another interesting problem concerns the adaptation of the re-ranking model trained on social media to collections from other genres and/or domains (news, blogs, etc.).",
        "To our knowledge, this domain adaptation problem for QA has not been investigated yet."
