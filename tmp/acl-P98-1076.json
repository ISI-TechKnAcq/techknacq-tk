        "This paper sets to establish the hypothesis of one tokenization per source.",
        "That is, if an ambiguous fragment appears two or more times in different sentences from the same source, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same tokenization.",
        "Sentence tokenization is the task of mapping sentences from character strings into streams of tokens.",
        "This is a long-standing problem in Chinese Language Processing, since, in Chinese, there is an apparent lack of such explicit word delimiters as white-spaces in English.",
        "And researchers have gradually been turning to model the task as a general lexicalization or bracketing problem in Computational Linguistics, with the hope that the research might also benefit the study of similar problems in multiple languages.",
        "For instance, in Machine Translation, it is widely agreed that many multiple-word expressions, such as idioms, compounds and some collocations, while not explicitly delimited in sentences, are ideally to be treated as single lexicalized units.",
        "The primary obstacle in sentence tokenization is in the existence of uncertainties both in the notion of words/tokens and in the recognition of words/tokens in context.",
        "The same fragment - in different contexts would have to be tokenized differently.",
        "For instance, the character string todayissunday would normally be tokenized as \"today is sunday\" but can also reasonably be \"today is sun day\".",
        "In terms of possibility, it has been argued that no lexically possible tokenization can not be grammatically and meaningfully realized in at least some special contexts, as every token can be assigned to bear any meaning without any orthographic means.",
        "Consequently, the mainstream research in the literature has been focused on the modeling and utilization of local and sentential contexts, either linguistically in a rule-based framework or statistically in a searching and optimization set-up (Gan, Palmer and Lua 1996; Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang 1996; Wu 1997; Guo 1997).",
        "Hence, it was really a surprise when we first observed the regularity of one tokenization per source.",
        "Nevertheless, the regularity turns out to be very helpful in sentence tokenization practice, and to be with far-reaching implications in natural language processing.",
        "Retrospectively, we now understand that it is by no means an isolated special phenomenon but another display of the postulated general law of one realization per expression.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we will first present a concrete corpus verification (Section 2), clarify its meaning and scope (Section 3), display its striking utility value in tokenization (Section 4), and then disclose its implication for the notion of words/tokens (Section 5), and associate the hypothesis with the general law of one realization per expression through examination of related works in the literature (Section 6)."

        "(1) Dictionary Existence: The tokenization contains no non-dictionary-entry character fragment.",
        "(2) Structural Consistency: The tokenization has no crossing-brackets (Black, Garside and Leech 1993) with at least one correct and complete structural analysis of its underlying sentence.",
        "(3) Maximum Tokenization: The tokenization is a critical tokenization (Guo 1997).",
        "The basic idea behind is to regard sentence tokenization as a (shallow) type of (phrase-structure-like) morpho-syntactic parsing which is to assign a treelike structure to a sentence.",

        "The linguistic object here is a critical fragment, i.e., the one in between two adjacent critical points or unambiguous token boundaries (Guo 1997), but not an arbitrary sentence segment.",

        "While the strategy is universally applicable to any tokenization ambiguity resolution, here we will only examine its performance in the resolution of critical ambiguities (Guo 1997), for ease of direct comparison with works in the literature.",
        "As above, we have manually tokenized3 all non-dictionary-entry critical fragments in the PH corpus; i.e., we have known the correct tokenizations for all of these fragments.",

        "Hence, a tokenization accuracy of about 50% can be expected for unknown non-dictionary-entry critical fragments.",
        "The question then becomes that: what is the chance of encountering a non-dictionary-entry critical fragment that has not been seen before in the PH corpus and thus has no known correct tokenization?",
        "A satisfactory answer to this question can be readily derived from the Good-Turing Theorem4 (Good 1953; Church and Gale with Kruskal 1991, page 49).",
        "Table 4 and Table 5 show that, among the 14,984 different non-dictionary-entry critical fragments and their 49,308 occurrences in the PH corpus, 9,587 different fragments each occurs exactly once.",
        "By the Good-Turing Theorem, the chance of encountering an arbitrary non-dictionary-entry critical fragment that is not in the PH corpus is about 9,587 over 49,308 or slightly less than 20%.",
        "In summary, if applied to non-dictionary-entry critical fragment tokenization, the simple strategy of tokenization by memorization delivers virtually 100% tokenization accuracy for slightly over 80% of the fragments, and about 50% accuracy for the rest 20% fragments, and hence has an overall tokenization accuracy of better than 90% (= 80% x 100% + 20% x 50%).",
        "This strategy rivals all proposals with directly comparable performance reports in the literature, including5 the representative one by Sun and T'sou (1995), which has the tokenization accuracy of 85.9%.",
        "Notice that what Sun and T'sou proposed is not a trivial solution.",
        "They developed an advanced four-step decision procedure that combines both mutual information and t-score indicators in a sophisticated way for sensible decision making.",
        "Since the memorization strategy complements with most other existing tokenization strategies, certain types of hybrid solutions are viable.",
        "For instance, if the strategy of tokenization by memorization is applied to known critical fragments and the Sun and T'sou algorithm is applied to unknown critical fragments, the overall accuracy of critical ambiguity resolution can be better than 97% (= 80% + 20% x 85.9%).",

        "The Notion of Tokens: A stretch of characters is a legitimate token to be put in tokenization dictionary if and only if it does not introduce any violation to the law of one tokenization per source.",

        "In contrast, while the paradigm of \"mutual affinity\" represented by measurements such as mutual information and t-score has repetitively exhibited inappropriateness in the very large number of intermediate cases, the paradigm of \"linguistic words\" represented by terms like syntactic-words, phonological-words and semantic-words is in essence rejecting the notion of Chinese words/tokens at all, as compounding, phrase-forming and even sentence formation in Chinese are governed by more or less the same set of regularities, and as the whole is always larger than the simple sum of its parts.",

        "Like most discoveries in the literature, when we first captured the regularity several years ago, we simply could not believe it.",

        "any of its utility value.",
        "Finally, after working out ways that unquestionably demonstrated its usefulness, we realized that, in the literature, so many supportive evidences have already been presented.",
        "Further, while never consciously in an explicit form, the hypothesis has actually already been widely employed.",
        "For example, Zheng and Liu (1997) recently studied a newswire corpus of about 1.8 million Chinese characters and reported that, among all the 4,646 different chain-length-1 two-character-overlapping-type6 ambiguous fragments which cumulatively occur 14,581 times in the corpus, only 8 fragments each has different tokenizations in different context, and there is no such fragment in all the 3,409 different chain-length-2 two-character-overlapping-type ambiguous fragments.",
        "Unfortunately, due to the lack of a proper representation framework comparable to the critical tokenization theory employed here, their observation is neither complete nor explanatory.",
        "It is not complete, since the two ambiguous types apparently do not cover all possible ambiguities.",
        "It is not explanatory, since both types of ambiguous fragments are not guaranteed to be critical fragments, and thus may involve other types of ambiguities.",
        "Consequently, Zheng and Liu (1997) themselves merely took the apparent regularity as a special case, and focused on the development of local-context-oriented disambiguation rules.",
        "Moreover, while they constructed for tokenization disambiguation an annotated \"phrase base\" of all ambiguous fragments in the large corpus, they still concluded that good results can not come solely from corpus but have to rely on the utilization of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and other information.",
        "The actual implementation of the weighted finite-state transducer by Sproat et al.",
        "(1996) can be taken as an evidence that the hypothesis of one tokenization per source has already in practical use.",

        "7 Roughly a four-character fragment abcd, where a, b, c, d, ab, bc, and cd are all tokens in the tokenization dictionary.",
        "utilizing local and sentential constraints, what Sproat et al.",
        "(1996) implemented was simply a token unigram scoring function.",
        "Under this setting, no critical fragment can realize different tokenizations in different local sentential context, since no local constraints other than the identity of a token together with its associated token score can be utilized.",
        "That is, the requirement of one tokenization per source has actually been implicitly obeyed.",
        "We admit here that, while we have been aware of the fact for long time, only after the dissemination of the closely related hypotheses of one sense per discourse (Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992)- and one sense per collocation (Yarowsky 1993), we are able to articulate the hypothesis of one tokenization per source.",
        "The point here is that, one tokenization per source is unlikely an isolated phenomenon.",
        "Rather, there must exist a general law that covers all the related linguistic phenomena.",
        "Let us speculate that, for a proper linguistic expression in a proper scope, there always exists the regularity of one realization per expression.",
        "That is, only one of the multiple values on one aspect of a linguistic expression can be realized in the specified scope.",
        "In this way, one tokenization per source becomes a particular articulation of one realization per expression.",
        "The two essential terms here are the proper linguistic expression and the proper scope of the claim.",
        "A quick example is helpful here: part-of-speech tagging for the English sentence \"Can you can the can?\" If the linguistic expressions are taken as ordinary English words, they are nevertheless highly ambiguous, e.g., the English word can realizes three different part-of-speeches in the sentence.",
        "However, if \"the can\", \"can the\" and the like are taken as the underling linguistic expressions, they are apparently unambiguous: \"the can/NN\", \"can/VB the\" and the rest \"can/MD\".",
        "This fact can largely be predicted by the hypothesis of one sense per collocation, and can partially explain the great success of Brill's transformation-based part-of-speech tagging (Brill 1993).",
