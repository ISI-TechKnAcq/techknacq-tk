        "In syntax, the trend nowadays is towards lexicalized grammar formalisms.",
        "It is now widely accepted that dividing words into wordclasses may serve as a labor-saving mechanism - but at the same time, it discards all detailed information on the idiosyncratic behavior of words.",
        "And that is exactly the type of information that may be necessary in order to parse a sentence.",
        "For learning approaches, however, lexicalized grammars represent a challenge for the very reason that they include so much detailed and specific information, which is difficult to learn.",
        "This paper will present an algorithm for learning a link granunar of German.",
        "The problem of data sparseness is tackled by using all the available information from partial parses as well as from an existing grammar fragment and a tagger.",

        "In the natural language learning community, probabilistic approaches play a dominant role.",
        "Yet probabilistic learning has its strength in finding major trends in the training data.",
        "An idiosyncratic behavior of a single word is very likely to go unnoticed for lack of data.",
        "This divergence in interest might be the reason why hardly any attempt was made to have a lexicalized grammar learned.",
        "In this paper, I will describe an approach to learning a link grammar.",
        "Link grammar (Sleator & Temperley 1991) is highly lexicalized, and therefore the problem of data sparseness will be immense.",
        "As a consequence, I have chosen a fuzzy representation.",
        "The fuzziness in this case models uncertainty rather than vagueness inherent in the language.",

        "Link grammar (Grinberg, Lafferty & Sleator, 1995; Sleator & Temperley 1991) is a highly lexical, context-free formalism that does not rely on constituent structure.",
        "Instead, it models connections between word pairs without building a hierarchical structure.",
        "The link grammar formalism is best explained with an example of a linkage (i.e. a link grammar parse): Figure 1 shows a linkage for an English sentence.",
        "A linkage is a graph in which the vertices, representing the words, are connected by labeled arcs.",
        "These arcs are called links.",
        "For a grammatically correct sentence, the linkage must fulfill the following requirements: the links do not cross (= planarity), the graph is connected, and at most one arc connects a pair of words.",
        "If there is no linkage for a sequence of words, the sentence is not in the language modeled by the grammar.",

        "The labels on the arcs denote the syntactic relations or constituent relationships of the connected words.",
        "In figure 1, the link labeled S connects the subject noun to the finite verb, D connects determiners to their nouns, MV connects the verb to the following prepositional phrase, etc.",
        "The grammar itself consists of a wordlist in which each word is paired up with all potential linking requirements.",
        "Each linking requirement models one usage of the word.",
        "A linking requirement, also called a disjunct, is a formal specification of the different connectors, which link with a matching connector of another word, including their direction and order.",
        "It is usually represented as a pair of ordered lists: the left list, containing connectors that link to the left of the word, and the right list, containing connectors that link to the right.",
        "For example, the linking requirement of the word \"girl\" in figure 1 is characterized by the formula ((D, A), (S)), for \"finished\" the formula is ((S) (0, MV)), and for \"young\" (0, (A)).",
        "In a more sophisticated version of the grammar, the labels are annotated by features, e.g. to ensure agreement between subject and verb.",
        "The link grammar formalism is similar to dependency grammar (Mel'cuk 1988, Tesniere 1959) in that both of them model connections between single words.",
        "But link grammar connections are purely lexical: they do not intend to model valency or semantic aspects of words.",
        "An additional advantage of link grammar is that there exists an efficient parsing algorithm (Sleator & Temperley 1991, 1996) whereas there does not seem to exist one for dependency grammar."

        "Link grammar, like many other formalisms, seems to be especially suited for the English language.",
        "When trying to use this formalism for other languages, it seems wise to adapt the formalism to the needs of these languages, most of which are caused by a fieer word order.",
        "In working with the German language, I have found the following changes immensely helpful: Sleator and Temperley (1991) strongly prefer local links (i.e. links connecting words to their immediate neighbors), even if this is not supported by linguistics.",
        "As German uses agreement much more extensively than English, it is necessary to link words according to the agreement requirements rather than because of immediate neighborhood.",
        "This approach results in considerably more long distance links.",
        "In English, the word order is rigidly determined for most parts of the sentence.",
        "Sleator and Temperley (1991) use different labels for links that can occur in more than one position (e.g. adverbs) depending on whether they are left or right links.",
        "In German, however, due to its freer word order, these phenomena are relatively common.",
        "In order to avoid using too many different labels describing the same kind of link but in different order, I have introduced the idea of control, or rather directionality of links.",
        "Each link is marked as either controller (§) or controlled (=).",
        "I can thus use the Slink for subjects preceding or following the finite verb, as shown in figure 2.",
        "The principle of planarity states that links in a linkage must not cross.",
        "Sleator and Temperley (1991, 1) comment that most sentences of most languages adhere to that principle.",
        "Unfortunately, German is one of the languages in which this principle is violated in a number of cases.",
        "Some of them are caused by the free word order, some by phenomena like the splitting of the verb: Duren wird vorgeworfen, sie flatten to them is reproached, they had sich in Berlin getroffen .",

        "The information about a gap somewhere in the structure is usually passed on through several levels of the constituent tree.",

        "Unlike other approaches to learning using constituent-based grammars, this system does not use the wordclass information to restrict the roles, a word can play in the parse.",
        "Rather it takes this information as a starting point in the search for potential disjuncts for unknown words.",
        "And if a new disjunct is found for a word already in the grammar, its credibility is tested by comparing the word's wordclass to the wordclass of the word with which the disjunct has the highest membership value in the grammar (cf. below).",

        "• After the wordclass information is provided, the systems looks for every potential conjugated verb in the sentence.",

        "All these links must fulfill the conditions that they must not cross, that the order of connectors in the disjunct must not be changed, and that no two links can connect the same pair of words.",
