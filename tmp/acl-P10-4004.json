        "GernEdiT replaces the traditional Ger-maNet development based on lexicographer files (Fellbaum, 1998) by a more user-friendly visual tool that supports versioning and collaborative annotation by several lexicographers working in parallel.",
        "Furthermore, GernEdiT facilitates internal consistency of the GermaNet data such as appropriate linking of lexical units with synsets, connectedness of the synset graph, and automatic closure among relations and their inverse counterparts.",

        "It covers the three word categories of adjectives, nouns, and verbs and partitions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are interlinked by semantic relations.",
        "A semantic concept is modeled by a synset.",
        "A synset is a set of words (called lexical units) where all the words are taken to have (almost) the same meaning.",
        "Thus a synset is a set-representation of the semantic relation of synonymy, which means that it consists of a list of lexical units.",
        "There are two types of semantic relations in GermaNet: conceptual and lexical relations.",
        "Conceptual relations hold between two semantic concepts, i.e. synsets.",
        "They include relations such as hyperonymy, part-whole relations, entailment, or causation.",

        "In order to assess the usefulness of GernEdiT, we conducted in depth interviews with the Germa-Net lexicographers and with the senior researcher who oversees all lexicographic development.",
        "At the time of the interview all of these researchers had worked with the tool for about eight months.",
        "The present section summarizes the feedback about GernEdiT that was obtained in this way.",
        "The initial learning curve for getting familiar with GernEdiT is considerably lower compared to the learning curve required for the traditional development based on lexicographer files.",
        "Moreover, the GermaNet development with GernEdiT is both more efficient and accurate compared to the traditional development along the following dimensions:",
        "1.",
        "The menu-driven and graphics-based navigation through the GermaNet graph is much easier compared to finding the correct entry point in the purely text-based format of lexicographer files.",
        "2.",
        "Lexicographers no longer need to learn the complex specification syntax of the lexicographer files.",
        "Thereby, syntax errors in the specification language - a frequent source of errors prior to development with GernEdiT - are entirely eliminated.",
        "3.",
        "GernEdiT facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correctness of the GermaNet data such as appropriate linking of lexical units with synsets, connectedness of the synset graph, and automatic closure among relations and their inverse counterparts.",
        "4.",
        "It is now even possible to perform further queries, which were not possible before, e.g., listing all hyponyms of a synset.",
        "5.",
        "Especially for the senior researcher who is responsible for coordinating the GermaNet lexicographers, it is now much easier to trace back changes and to verify who was responsible for them.",
        "6.",
        "The collaborative annotation by several lexicographers working in parallel is now easily possible and does not cause any management overhead as before.",
        "In sum, the lexicographers of GermaNet gave very positive feedback about the use of Gern-EdiT and also made smaller suggestions for improving its user-friendliness further.",
        "This underscores the utility of GernEdiT from a practical point of view."

        "The extremely positive feedback of the GermaNet lexicographers underscores the practical benefits gained by using the GernEdiT tool in practice.",
        "At the moment, GernEdiT is customized for maintaining the GermaNet data.",
        "In future work, we plan to adapt the tool so that it can be used with wordnets for other languages as well.",
        "This would mean that the wordnet data for a given language would have to be stored in a relational database and that the tool itself can handle the language specific data structures of the wordnet in question."
