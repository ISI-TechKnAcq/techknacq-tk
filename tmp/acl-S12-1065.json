        "Cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) detection (Mehdad et al., 2010) is an extension of the textual entailment (TE) detection (Dagan et al., 2006) problem.",
        "TE detection consists of finding out, for two text fragments T and H in the same language, whether T entails H from a semantic point of view or not.",
        "CLTE presents a similar problem, but with T and H written in different languages.",
        "During the last years, many authors have focused on resolving TE detection, as solutions to this problem have proved to be useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006) or machine translation (MT) (Mirkin et al., 2009; Pado?",
        "et al, 2009).",
        "Therefore, CLTE may also be useful for related tasks in which more than one language is involved, such as cross-lingual question answering or cross-lingual information retrieval.",
        "Although CLTE detection is a relatively new problem, it has already been tackled.",
        "Mehdad et al. (2010) propose to use machine translation (MT) to translate H from LH , the language of H , into LT , the language of T , and then use any of the state-of-the-art TE approaches.",
        "In a later work (Mehdad et al., 2011), the authors use MT, but in a more elaborate way.",
        "They train a phrase-based statistical MT (PBSMT) system (Koehn et al., 2003) translating from LH to LT , and use the translation table obtained as a by-product of the training process to extract a set of features which are processed by a support vector machine classifier (Theodoridis and Koutroumbas, 2009, Sect.",
        "3.7) to decide whether T entails H or not.",
        "Castillo (2011) discusses another machine learning approach in which the features are obtained from semantic similarity measures based on WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "In this work we present a new approach to tackle the problem of CLTE detection using a machine learning approach, partly inspired by that of Mehdad et al.",
        "(2011).",
        "Our method uses MT as a source of information to detect semantic relationships between T and H .",
        "To do so, we firstly split both T and H into all the possible sub-segments with lengths between 1 and L, the maximum length, measured in words.",
        "We then translate the set of sub-segments from T into LH , and vice versa, and collect all the sub-segment pairs in a single set.",
        "We claim that when T side sub-segments match T and their corresponding H-side sub-segments match H , this reveals a semantic relationship between them, which can be used to determine whether T entails H or not.",
        "Note that MT is used as a black box, i.e. sub-segment translations may be collected from any MT system, and that our approach could even use any other sources of bilingual sub-sentential information.",
        "It is even possible to combine different MT systems as we do in our experiments.",
        "This is a key point of our work, since",
        "it uses MT in a more elaborate way than Mehdad et al.",
        "(2010), and it does not depend on a specific MT approach.",
        "Another important difference between this work and that of Mehdad et al. (2011) is the set of features used for classification.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the method used to collect the MT information and obtain the features; Section 3 explains the experimental framework; Section 4 shows the results obtained for the different features combination proposed; the paper ends with concluding remarks."
