        "It discusses the planning of concept activation actions that are realized by definite referring expressions in the planned utterances, and shows how it is possible to integrate physical actions for communicating intentions with linguistic actions, resulting in plans that include pointing as one of the communicative actions available to the speaker."

        "Consider the situation (depicted in Figure 1) in which two agents, an apprentice and an expert, are cooperating on a common task, such as disassembling an air compressor.",
        "Several tools are lying on the workbench, and although the apprentice knows that the objects are there, he may not necessarily know where they are.",
        "The expert might say: Use the wheelpuller to remove the flywheel.",
        "(1) while pointing at the wheelpuller.",
        "The apprentice may think to himself at this point, \"Ah, ha, so that's a wheel-puller,\" and then proceed to remove the flywheel.",
        "What the expert is accomplishing through the utterance of (1) by using the noun phrase \"the wheelpullee cannot be fully explained by treating definite referring expressions simply as descriptions that are uniquely true of some object, even taking focusing [71111] into account.",
        "The expert uses \"the wheelpuller\" to refer to an object that in fact uniquely fits the description predicated of it, so this simple analysis is incapable of accounting for the effects the expert intends his utterance to have.",
        "If one takes the knowledge and intentions of the speaker and hearer into account, a more accurate account of the speaker's use of the referring expression can be developed.",
        "The apprentice does not know what the object is that fits the description \"the wheelpuller\".",
        "The expert knows that the apprentice doesn't know this, and performs the pointing action to guarantee that his intentions will be recognized correctly.",
        "The apprentice must recognize what the expert is trying to communicate by pointing â€“ he must realize that pointing is not just a random gesture, but is intended by the speaker to be recognized as a communicative act by the hearer in much the same way as his utterances are recognized as communicative acts.",
        "Furthermore, the apprentice must recognize how the pointing act is cot related with the utterance the expert is producing.",
        "Although there is no spee''.. Jeictic reference in the expert's utterance, it is clear that he does not mean the flywheel, since we will assume that the apprentice can determine that the object",
        "he is pointing to is a tool.",
        "The apprentice realizes that the object the expert is pointing to is the intended referent of \"the wheelpuller,\" but in the process, he also acquires the information that the expert believes the object he is pointing to is a wheelpuller, and that the expert has also informed him of that fact.",
        "A language-planning system called KAMP (for Knowledge And Modalities Planner) has been developed that can plan utterances similar to example (1) above, coordinate the linguistic actions with physical actions, and know that the utterance it plans will have the intended multiple effects on the hearer.",
        "KAMP builds on Cohen and Perrault's idea of planning speech acts Fib but extends the planning activity down to the level of constructing surface English sentences.",
        "A detailed description of the entire KAMP system can be found in [2].",

        "The reference problems that KAMP addresses are a subset of a more general problem, which, following Cohen [5] will be called 'identification.'",
        "Whenever a speaker makes a definite reference, he intends the hearer to identify some object in the world as the referent.",
        "Identifying a refer* ent requires that the agent perform some cognitive activity, such as the simple case of matching the description with what he knows, or in some cases plan to perform perceptual actions that lead to the identification.",
        "ICAmP simplifies the problem by not considering perceptual actions, and assumes that there is some 'perceptual field' common to the participants in a dialogue, and that the objects that lie within that field are mutually known to the participants, along with the observable properties and relations that hold among them.",
        "For example, the speaker and hearer in (1) are assumed to mutually know the size, shape and location of all objects on the workbench.",
        "The agents may not know unobservable properties of the objects, such as the fact that a particular tool is a wheelpuller.",
        "Similarly, the participants are assumed to be mutually aware of physical actions that take place within their perceptual field, without explicitly performing any perceptual actions.",

        "For example, in requesting a hearer to remove the pump from the platform in an air-compressor assembly task, if the hearer knows that the pump is attached to the platform and nothing else, it is not necessary to mention the platform, since it is sufficient to say \"Remove the pump,\" for the hearer to recognize the following proposition: Want(S, Do(H, Remove(pumpl, platformI))).",
        "The planning of a concept-activation action is similar to the planning of an illocutionary act in that the speaker is trying to get the hearer to recognize his intention to perform the act.",

        "speaker wants to refer to the object.",
        "This is often done by incorporating a mutually believed description of the object into the utterance, but there is no requirement that the means by which the speaker communicates this intention be linguistic.",
        "For example, the speaker could point at an object (almost always a communicative act), or perhaps throw it at the hearer (not so clearly communicative but definitely attention-getting.",
        "The hearer has to reason whether there are any communicative intentions behind the act.)",
        "Since concept-activation actions are planned during the expansion of surface speech-acts, the actions that realize them must somehow become part of the utterance being planned.",
        "Therefore, all concept-activation actions are expanded with two components: an intention-communication component and a surface-linguistic component.",
        "The intention-communication component is an abstraction of the speaker's plan to communicate his intention to refer, and may be realized by a plan that includes physical and linguistic actions.",

Axiom schema (5) says that after agent A performs the action, the two agents A and B mutually know that the action has been performed.",
        "The consequence for the planner of axiomatizing concept activation as in (4) and (5) is that the problem of activating a concept now becomes one of getting the hearer to know that the speaker wants a particular concept to be active.",

        "KAmP knows about two types of actions that produce knowledge about what concepts a speaker wants to be active.",
        "One is an action called describe, which is ultimately expanded into a linguistic description corresponding to the concept the speaker intends to activate, and the other is called point, which is a generalized pointing action.",

        "Therefore, if the speaker and hearer mutually know of an object that satisfies 0 in focus, then they mutually know that the speaker wants it to be active.",
        "The pointing action is much simpler because it does not require either the speaker or the hearer to know anything at all about the object.",
        "According to the above axiom, if an agent points at an object, that implies that he wants the object to be active.",
        "As usual, an axiom similar to (5) is required to assert that the agents mutually know the action has been performed.",
        "Axioms (4) and (5) work together with (6) and (7) to produce the desired effects.",
        "When a speaker utters a description, or points, he communicates his intention to refer.",
        "When he performs the concept-activation action by incorporating the surface-linguistic component of his action into a surface speech-act, his intentions are carried out.",
        "Because the equivalence of axiom (6) can be used in both directions, if the speaker wants an object to be active, then one can reason that he knows the description predicated of it is true.",
        "A major problem facing the planner is deciding when the necessary conditions obtain to be able to take advantage of the interactions between (6) and (7).",
        "Since this task involves examining several actions in the plan, it is",
        "of a predication that could be included in the description associated with a concept activation.",
        "When such an interaction is noticed, the critic proposes a modification to the plan.",
        "If the surface-linguistic component does not insist that the modification is impossible given the grammar, then the action subsumption is carried out.",
        "In example (1), for instance, the expert has a high-level plan that includes the performance of two illocutionary acts: requesting that the apprentice remove the pump using a particular tool (call it tool/), and informing the apprentice that toot/ is a wheelpuller.",
        "The action subsumption critic notices that in the request the expert is referring to to oil and also wants to inform the hearer of a property of tool/.",
