        "The importance of unsupervised approaches in WSD is well known, because they do not need sense tagged corpus.",
        "In multilingual unsupervised scenario, either comparable or parallel corpora have been used by past researchers for disambiguation (Dagan et al., 1991; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Kaji and Morimoto, 2002; Specia et al., 2005; Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Khapra et al., 2011).",
        "Recent work by Khapra et al., (2011) has shown that, in comparable corpora, sense distribution of a word in one language can be estimated using the raw counts of translations of the target words in the other language; such sense distributions contribute to the ranking of senses.",
        "Since translations can themselves be ambiguous, Expectation Maximization based formulation is used to determine the sense frequencies.",
        "Using this approach every instance of a word is tagged with the most probable sense according to the algorithm.",
        "In the above formulation, no importance is given to the context.",
        "That would do, had the accuracy of disambiguation on verbs not been poor 25-35%.",
        "This motivated us to propose and investigate use of context in the formulation by Khapra et al. (2011).",
        "For example consider the sentence in chemistry domain, ?Keep the beaker on the flat table.?",
        "In this sentence, the target word ?table?",
        "will be tagged as ?the tabular array?",
        "sense since it is dominant in the chemistry domain by their algorithm.",
        "But its actual sense is ?a piece of furniture?",
        "which can be captured only if context is taken into consideration.",
        "In our approach we tackle this problem by taking into account the words from the context of the target word.",
        "We use semantic relatedness between translations of the target word and those of its context words to determine its sense.",
        "Verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult (Jean, 2004), because of high degree of polysemy (Khapra et al., 2010), too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation.",
        "On the other hand, verb disambiguation is very important for NLP applications like MT and IR.",
        "Our approach has shown significant improvement in verb accuracy as compared to Khapra's (2011) approach.",
        "The roadmap of the paper is as follows.",
