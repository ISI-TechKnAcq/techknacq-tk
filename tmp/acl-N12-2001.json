        "Effective knowledge management is a key factor in the development and success of any organisation.",
        "Many different methods have been devised to address this need.",
        "Applying these methods to identify the experts within an organisation has attracted a lot of attention.",
        "We look at one such problem that arises within universities on a daily basis but has attracted little attention in the literature, namely the problem of a searcher who is trying to identify a potential PhD supervisor, or, from the perspective of the university's research office, to allocate a PhD application to a suitable supervisor.",
        "We reduce this problem to identifying a ranked list of experts for a given query (representing a research area).",
        "We report on experiments to find experts in a university domain using two different methods to extract a ranked list of candidates: a database-driven method and a data-driven method.",
        "The first one is based on a fixed list of experts (e.g. all members of academic staff) while the second method is based on automatic Named-Entity Recognition (NER).",
        "We use a graded weighting based on proximity between query and candidate name to rank the list of candidates.",
        "As a baseline, we use a system that ranks candidates simply based on frequency of occurrence within the top documents."

        "The knowledge and expertise of individuals are significant resources for organisation.",
        "Managing this intangible resource effectively and efficiently constitutes an essential and very important task (Non-aka and Takeuchi, 1995; Law and Ngai, 2008).",
        "Approaching experts is the primary and most direct way of utilising their knowledge (Yang and Huh, 2008; Li et al., 2011).",
        "Therefore, it is important to have a means of locating the right experts within organisations.",
        "The expert-finding task can be categorised as an information retrieval task similar to a web search, but where the results are people rather than documents.",
        "An expert-finding system allows users to input a query, and it returns a ranked list of experts.",
        "Here we look at a university context.",
        "We start with a real-world problem which is to identify a list of experts within an academic environment, e.g. a university intranet.",
        "The research reported here is based on an empirical study of a simple but effective method in which a system that applies the concept of expert-finding has been designed and implemented.",
        "The proposed system will contribute to provide an expert-search service to all of the university's stakeholders.",
        "Expert-finding systems require two main resources in order to function: a list of candidates and a collection of data from which the evidence of expertise can be extracted.",
        "We present two approaches to address this problem, a database-driven and a data-driven method using NER.",
        "The main difference between the two methods is the way in which the candidates?",
        "list is constructed.",
        "In the database method, the candidates are simply selected from a known list of experts, e.g. the university's academic staff.",
        "In the NER method, the candidates are extracted automatically from the pages returned by an",
        "underlying search engine.",
        "This method promises to be more useful for finding experts from a wider (and possibly more up-to-date) range of candidates.",
        "Both methods apply the same ranking function(s), as will be discussed below.",
        "This paper will survey related work in Section 2 and introduce the expert-finding task in a university domain in Section 3.",
        "The process of ranking experts will be discussed in Section 4.",

        "The expert-finding task addresses the problem of retrieving a ranked list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
        "This task has found its place in the commercial environment as early as the 1980?s, as discussed in Maybury (2006); however, there was very limited academic research on finding and ranking experts until the introduction of the enterprise track at the 2005 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) (Craswell et al., 2005).",
        "When expert-finding we must know the experts?",
        "profiles, These profiles may be generated manually or automatically.",
        "Manually created profiles may be problematic.",
        "If, for example, experts enter their own information, they may exaggerate or downplay their expertise.",
        "In addition, any changes of expertise for any expert requires a manual update to the expert's profile.",
        "Thus incurring high maintenance costs.",
        "An example of manually generated profiles is the work of Dumais and Nielsen (1992).",
        "Although their system automatically assigns submitted manuscripts to reviewers, the profiles of the reviewers or experts are created manually.",
        "The alternative is to generate the profiles automatically, for example by extracting relevant information from a document collection.",
        "The assumption is that individuals will tend to be expert in the topics of documents with which they are associated.",
        "Experts can be associated with the documents in which they are mentioned (Craswell et al., 2001) or with emails they have sent or received (Balog and de Ri-jke, 2006a; Campbell et al., 2003; Dom et al., 2003).",
        "They can also be associated with their home pages or CVs (Maybury et al., 2001), and with documents they have written (Maybury et al., 2001; Becerra-Fernandez, 2000).",
        "Finally, some researchers use search logs to associate experts with the web pages they have visited (Wang et al., 2002; Macdonald and White, 2009).",
        "After associating candidate experts with one or more of the kinds of textual evidence mentioned above, the next step is to find and rank candidates based on a user query.",
        "Many methods have been proposed to perform this task.",
        "Craswell et al. (2001) create virtual documents for each candidate (or employee).",
        "These virtual documents are simply concatenated texts of all documents from the corpus associated with a particular candidate.",
        "Afterwards, the system indexes and processes queries for the employee's documents.",
        "The results would show a list of experts based on the ten best matching employee documents.",
        "Liu et al. (2005) have applied expert-search in the context of a community-based question-answering service.",
        "Based on a virtual document approach, their work applied three language models: the query likelihood model, the relevance model and the cluster-based language model.",
        "They concluded that combining language models can enhance the retrieval performance.",
        "Two principal approaches recognised for expert-finding can be found in the literature.",
        "Both were first proposed by Balog et al. (2006b).",
        "The models are called the candidate model and the document model, or Model 1 and Model 2, respectively.",
        "Different names have been used for the two methods.",
        "Fang and Zhai (2007) refer to them as ?Candidate Generation Models and Topic Generation Models?.",
        "Petkova and Croft (2006) call them the ?Query-Dependent Model?",
        "and the ?Query-Independent Model?.",
        "The main difference between the models is that the candidate-based approaches (Model 1) build a textual representation of candidate experts, and then rank the candidates based on the given query, whereas the document-based approaches (Model 2) first find documents that are relevant to the query, and then locate the associated experts in these documents.",
        "Balog et al. (2006b) have compared the two models and concluded that Model 2 outperforms Model 1 on all measures (for this reason, we will adopt Model 2).",
        "As Model 2 proved to be more efficient, it formed the basis of many other expert-search systems (Fang",
        "and Zhai, 2007; Petkova and Croft, 2007; Yao et al., 2008).",
        "Fang and Zhai developed a mixture model using proximity-based document representation.",
        "This model makes it possible to put different weights on different representations of a candidate expert (Fang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "Another mixture of personal and global language models was proposed by Serdyukov and Hiemstra (2008).",
        "They combined two criteria for personal expertise in the final ranking: the probability of generation of the query by the personal language model and a prior probability of candidate experts that expresses their level of activity in the important discussions on the query topic.",
        "Zhu et al. (2010) claimed that earlier language models did not consider document features.",
        "They proposed an approach that incorporates: internal document structure; document URLs; page rank; anchor texts; and multiple levels of association between experts and topics.",
        "All of the proposed frameworks assume that the more documents associated with a candidate that score highly with respect to a query, the more likely the candidate is to have relevant expertise for that query.",
        "Macdonald and Ounis (2008) developed a different approach, called the Voting Model.",
        "In their model, candidate experts are ranked first by considering a ranking of documents with respect to the users?",
        "query.",
        "Then, using the candidate profiles, votes from the ranked documents are converted into votes for candidates.",
        "There have been attempts to tackle the expert-finding problem using social networks.",
        "This has mainly been investigated from two directions.",
        "The first direction uses graph-based measures on social networks to produce a ranking of experts (Campbell et al., 2003; Dom et al., 2003).",
        "The second direction assumes similarities among the neighbours in a social network and defines a smoothing procedure to rank experts (Karimzadehgan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "Some have argued that it is not enough to find experts by looking only at the queries?",
        "without taking the users into consideration.",
        "They claim that there are several factors that may play a role in decisions concerning which experts to recommend.",
        "Some of these factors are the users?",
        "expertise level, social proximity and physical proximity (Borgatti and Cross, 2003; McDonald and Ackerman, 1998; Shami et al., 2008).",
        "McDonald and Ackerman (1998) emphasised the importance of the accessibility of the expert.",
        "They argued that people usually prefer to contact the experts who are physically or organisationally close to them.",
        "Moreover, Shami et al. (2008) found that people prefer to contact experts they know, even when they could potentially receive more information from other experts who are located outside their social network.",
        "Woudstra and van den Hooff (2008) identified a number of factors in selecting experts that are related to quality and accessibility.",
        "They argued that the process of choosing which candidate expert to contact might differ depending on the specific situation.",
        "Hofmann et al. (2010) showed that many of these factors can be modelled.",
        "They claimed that integrating them with retrieval models can improve retrieval performance.",
        "Smirnova and Balog (2011) provided a user-oriented model for expert-finding where they placed an emphasis on the social distance between the user and the expert.",
        "They considered a number of social graphs based on organisational hierarchy, geographical location and collaboration."
