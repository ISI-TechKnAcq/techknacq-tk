        "Recognizing that knowledge for understanding sentiment is common sense and does not require experts, we plan to take a new approach where labelled data is obtained from people using human computation platforms and games.",
        "We also prove that the method can provide not only labelled texts, but people also help by selecting sentiment-expressing features that can generalize well.",
        "Human computation is a newly emerging paradigm.",

        "This process is called gamification.",
        "The game design should be such that the solution to the main problems can be formed by appropriately aggregating results of played games.",
        "In this work, we propose a cooperative human computation game for sentiment analysis called Guesstiment.",

        "By playing a collaborative game, people rate hotel reviews as positive and negative and select words and phrases within the reviews that best express the chosen polarity.",
        "We compare these annotations with those obtained during a former crowd-sourcing survey and prove that packaging the problem as a game can improve the quality of the responses.",
        "We also compare our approach with the state-of-the-art machine",

        "We cluster users based on the faceted opinions we retrieved, using the k-Means algorithm (Mac-Queen, 1967).",
        "Each reviewer is represented by a feature vector and each feature i within the vector is the cumulative opinion expressed by the reviewer with regard to topic zi.",
        "The reviews within the same cluster j have a similar representation from the mined opinion perspective.",
        "If the quality of the opinion mining process is high, the numeric ratings associated to the reviews within a cluster will also be similar, thus their variance V arj(nr(r)) will be lower than the overall variance.",
        "We study the difference between the mean intra cluster variance avgV arj(nr(r)) and overall variance V ar(nr(r))",
        "and the results are shown in table 4 for different numbers of clusters, using both topic models and both dictionaries.",
        "The results show that we succeeded in decreasing the variance by more than 20% using the Guesstiment dictionary and the frequent noun topics.",
        "A 17% decrease is obtained by using the same topic set and the OpinionFinder dictionary, while the decreases for the LDA topics with dictionaries are three times lower.",
        "This proves that the dictionary resulted from playing the Guesstiment game is better suited for faceted opinion analysis than an established resource like OpinionFinder."

        "In this paper we introduced Guesstiment, a human computation game for simultaneous feature extraction and sentiment annotation.",
        "By conducting various experiments, we showed that quality of the annotations obtained using our approach outperforms those obtained by classic crowd-sourcing.",
        "This is an indicator of the fact that packaging a crowd-sourcing problem as a game can improve the quality of the obtained results.",
        "It's mostly because that games attract more attention from people than simple questions which are common ways of crowd-sourcing.",
        "We also showed that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods which illustrates that human computation power is still superior to machine intelligence in this problem.",
        "The idea of the game could be further extended by testing other more complicated scoring functions which could better motivate players to submit high quality results.",
        "Also other document selection strategies can be created to make a better trade-off between informativeness and interestingness, or exploration and exploitation.",
        "Moreover, a computer player could be designed to perform active learning on feature extraction and direct the word suggestion process toward selecting more informative features, hereby obtaining a more discriminative high-quality lexicon."
