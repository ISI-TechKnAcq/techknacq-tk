        "Handling words properly is very important for Natural Language Processing.",
        "Words are basic unit to assign syntactic/semantic information manually, basic unit to acquire knowledge based on frequencies and co-occurrences, and basic unit to access texts in Information Retrieval.",
        "Languages with explicit word boundaries, like white spaces in English, do not suffer from this issue so severely, though it is a bit troublesome to handle compounds and hyphenation appropriately.",
        "On the other hand, languages without explicit boundaries such as Japanese always suffer from this issue.",
        "Japanese character set and their usage.",
        "Here, we briefly explain Japanese character set and their usage.",
        "Japanese uses about 6,000 ideogram, Kanji characters, 83 phonogram, Hiragana, and another 86 phonogram, Katakana.",
        "Kanji is used for Japanese time-honored nouns (including words imported from China ancient times) and stems of verbs and adjectives; Hiragana is used for function words such as postpositions and auxiliary verbs, and endings of verbs and adjectives; Katakana is used for loan words, mostly from the West, as transliterations.",
        "Japanese is very active to naturalize loan words.",
        "Neologisms in special/technical domains are often transliterated into Katakana words without translations, or even if there are translations, Katakana transliterations are more commonly used in many cases.",
        "For example, ^ i/fcfrt – , transliteration of \"computer\" is more commonly used than the translation, t\\W-Wi(keisanki).",
        "Even for some time-honored Japanese nouns, both Japanese nouns and transliterations of their English translations are used together these days, and the use of",
        "Automatic Acquisition of Basic Katakana Lexicon from a Given Corpus 683",
        "transliterations is increasing, such as x X 9 V – 9, transliteration of \"desk work\" vs. #L tfc 1k(tsukue shigoto).",
        "Furthermore, some Japanese nouns, typically the names of animals, plants, and food, which can be written in Kanji or Hiragana, are also written in Katakana sometimes [4, 6].",
        "Word segmentation and Katakana words.",
        "Let us go back to the word segmentation issue.",
        "Japanese word segmentation is performed like this: Japanese words are registered into the dictionary; given an input sentence, all possible words embedded in the sentence and their connections are checked by looking up the dictionary and some connectivity grammar; then the most plausible word sequence is selected.",
        "The criteria of selecting the best word sequence were simple heuristic rules preferring longer words in earlier times, and some cost calculation based on manual rules or using some training data, these days.",
        "Such a segmentation process is in practice not so difficult for Kanji-Hiragana string.",
        "First of all, since Kanji words and Hiragana words are fairly stable excepting proper nouns, they are most perfectly registered in the dictionary.",
        "Then, the orthogonal usage of Kanji and Hiragana mentioned above makes the segmentation rather simple, as follows:",
        "Kanji compound words can cause a segmentation problem.",
        "However, since large number of Kanji characters lead fairly sparse space of Kanji words, most Kanji compounds can be segmented unambiguously.",
        "A real troublemaker is Katakana words, which are sometimes very long compounds such as \"extra vergin olive oil\" and",
        "\"Japan cup cycle road race\".",
        "As mentioned above, many neologisms are written in Katakana, it is almost impossible to register all or most Katakana words into a dictionary by hand.",
        "To handle such an insufficiency of a dictionary, conventional Japanese word segmentation incorporates a fall-safe method, which considers a whole continuous Katakana string as a word, when it is neither a registered-word, nor a combination of registered-words.",
        "And, Japanese word segmentation basically prefers longer registered words.",
        "These mechanism leads that, for example, the Katakana string \"tomato sauce\" is properly segmented to \"tomato\" and \"sauce\", only when and are in the dictionary and is not.",
        "When alone is in the dictionary (means an imperfect dictionary) or is in the dictionary (means a redundant dictionary), is regarded as one word.",
        "Considering the importance of words as a basic unit of NLP, it is quite problematic to handle as a single word.",
        "We cannot use information that",
        "is a kind of , which is very important for deeper/semantic processing of texts; a text including cannot be retrieved with the word or .",
        "Note that a rough treatment using partial string matching causes a tragedy that y^(risösu) \"resource\" matches V – X \"sauce\" and X7^f ^(suraisu) \"slice\" matches y 4 ^(raisu)\"rice\" and 4 ^(isu)\"chair\"!",
        "To solve this severe problem, this paper proposes a method of constructing precise and concise Japanese Katakana word dictionary, by automatically judging a given",
        "Katakana string is a single-word or compound, and registering only single-words to the dictionary.",
        "We suppose only a medium or large size of Japanese corpus is given, and Katakana strings and their frequencies in the corpus are extracted as follows.",
        "We call this data as a word-occurrence data hereafter.",
        "Our proposed method consists of the following three methods, which utilize only a word-occurrence data and publicly available resources: - A method using a Japanese-English dictionary.",
        "- A method using a huge English corpus and a Japanese-English dictionary.",
        "- A method using relation in a word-occurrence data.",
        "Since most Katakana words are transliterations of English words, we exploit Japanese-English translation information as much as possible, using a Japanese-English dictionary and a huge English corpus.",
        "Since these methods, however, cannot achieve high-recall, the third method uses a word-occurrence data itself: a Katakana word is regarded as a compound if it is a combination of other, frequent Katakana words in the word-occurrence data.",
        "These three methods vary from high-precision to high-recall, and their appropriate combination leads to high-precision, high-recall analysis.",
        "We explain these three methods in detail, and then report the experimental results and discussion."
