        "This paper shows how to induce an N-best translation lexicon from a bilingual text corpus using statistical properties of the corpus together with four external knowledge sources.",
        "The knowledge sources are cast as filters, so that any subset of them can be cascaded in a uniform framework.",
        "A new objective evaluation measure is used to compare the quality of lexicons induced with different filter cascades.",
        "The best filter cascades improve lexicon quality by up to 137% over the plain vanilla statistical method, and approach human performance.",
        "Drastically reducing the size of the training corpus has a much smaller impact on lexicon quality when these knowledge sources are used.",
        "This makes it practical to train on small hand-built corpora for language pairs where large bilingual corpora are unavailable.",

        "A machine translation system must be able to choose among possible translations based on context.",
        "To do this, it usually relies on a translation lexicon that contains a number of possible translations for each word.",
        "N best translation lexicons contain up to N candidate translations for each word, ordered from most probable to least probable, sometimes specifying a priori probabilities or likelihood scores.",
        "Existing automatic methods for constructing N-best translation lexicons rely on the availability of large training corpora of parallel texts in the source and target languages.",
        "For some methods, the corpora must also be aligned by sentence [Bro93, Ga1914 Unfortunately, such training corpora are available for only a handful of language pairs, and the cost to create enough training data manually for new language pairs is very high.",
        "This paper presents",
        "1. a new automatic evaluation method for N-best translation lexicons, 2. a filter-based approach for enhancing statistical translation models with non-statistical sources of information, 3. four sources of information that can drastically reduce the necessary amount of training material.",
        "The evaluation method uses a simple objective criterion rather than relying on subjective human judges.",
        "It allows many experiments to be run without concern about the cost, availability and reliability of human evaluators.",
        "The filter-based approach is designed to identify likely (source word, target word)' pairs, using a statistical decision procedure.",
        "Candidate word pairs are drawn from a corpus of aligned sentences: (S, T) is a candidate if T appears in the translation of a sentence containing S. In the simplest case, the decision procedure considers all candidates for inclusion in the lexicon; but the new framework allows a cascade of non-statistical filters to remove inappropriate pairs from consideration.",
        "Each filter is based on a particular knowledge source, and can be placed into the cascade independently of the others.",
        "The knowledge sources investigated here are:",
        "• part of speech information, • machine-readable bilingual dictionaries (MRBDs), • cognate heuristics, and • word alignment heuristics.",
        "[Bro94] investigated the statistical use of MRBDs, though not as filters.",
        "The other three knowledge sources have not previously been used for the task of inducing translation lexicons.",
        "The filter-based framework, together with the fully automatic evaluation method, allows easy investigation of the relative efficacy of cascades of each of the subsets of these four filters.",
        "As will be shown below, some filter cascades sift candidate word pairs so well that training corpora small enough to be hand-built can be used to induce more accurate translation lexicons than those induced from a much larger training corpus without such filters.",
        "In one evaluation, a training corpus of 500 sentence pairs processed with these knowledge sources achieved a precision of 0.54, while a training corpus of 100,000 training pairs alone achieved a precision of only 0.45.",
        "Such improvements could not be previously obtained, because",
        "• These knowledge sources have not been used together for this task before.",
        "• There was no way to uniformly combine the different kinds of filters.",
        "• There was no way to objectively judge lexicon precision.",
        "Table 1 provides a qualitative demonstration of how a lexicon entry gradually improves as more filters are applied.",
        "The table contains actual entries for the French source word \"premier,\" from 7 best lexicons that were induced from 5000 pairs of training sentences, using different filter cascades.",
        "The baseline lexicon, induced with no filters, contains correct translations only in the first and sixth positions.",
        "The Cognate Filter disallows all candidate translations of French \"premier\" whenever the English cognate \"premier\" appears in the target English sentence.",
        "This causes English \"premier\" to move up to second position.",
        "The Part-of-Speech Filter realizes that \"premier\" can only be an adjective in French, whereas in the English Hansards it is mostly used as a noun.",
        "So, it throws out that pairing, along with several other English noun candidates, allowing \"first\" to move up to third position.",
        "The POS and Cognate filters reduce noise better together than separately.",
        "More of the incorrect translations are filtered out in the \"POS Sz COG\" column, making room for \"foremost.\" Finally, the MRBD Filter narrows the list down to just the three translations of French \"premier\" that are appropriate in the Hansard sublanguage.",

        "Next, the candidate translations from each pair of training sentences were passed through a cascade of filters.",
        "The remaining candidate translations from all training sentence pairs were pooled together and fed into a fixed decision procedure.",

        "While the true size of the source vocabulary is usually unknown, recall can be estimated using a representative text sample by computing the fraction of words in the text that also appear in the lexicon.",

        "The large number of quantitative lexicon evaluations required for the present study made it infeasible to rely on evaluation by human judges.",

        "The BiBLE approach is suitable for many different evaluation tasks.",
        "Besides comparing different lexicons on different scales, BiBLE can be used to compare different parts of one lexicon that has been partitioned using some characteristic of its entries.",

        "• a uniform framework for combining various data filters with statistical methods for inducing N-best translation lexicons, • an automatic evaluation method for translation lexicons which obviates the need for labor-intensive subjective evaluation by human judges, • four different ways to improve statistical translation models, • a demonstration of how tiny training corpora can be enhanced with non-statistical knowledge sources to induce better lexicons than unenhanced training corpora many times the size.",
        "The effectiveness of different data filters for inducing translation lexicons crucially depends on the particular pair of languages under consideration.",
        "Cognates are more common, and therefore more useful, in languages which are more closely related.",
        "For example, one would expect to find more cognates between Russian and Ukrainian than between French and English.",
        "The implementation of a part of speech filter for a given pair of languages depends on the availability of part of speech taggers for both languages, where the two taggers have a small common tag set.",
        "The effectiveness of oracle filters based on MRBDs will depend on the extent to which the vocabulary of the MRBD intersects with the vocabulary of the training text.",
        "This, in turn, depends partly on the size of the MRBD.",
        "Filters based on word alignment patterns will only be as good as the model of typical word alignments between the pair of languages in question.",
        "For languages with very similar syntax, a linear model will suffice.",
        "Higher order models will be required for a pair of languages like English and Japanese.",
        "For the case of French and English, each of the presented filters makes a significant improvement over the baseline model.",
        "Taken together, the filters produce models which approach human performance.",
        "These conclusions could not have been drawn without a uniform framework for filter comparison or without a technique for automatic evaluation.",
        "An automatic evaluation technique such as BiBLE should be used to gauge the effectiveness of any MT system which has a lexical transfer component.",
        "BiBLE's objective criterion is quite simple, with the drawback that it gives no indication of what kinds of errors exist in the lexicon being evaluated.",
        "Even so, given a test corpus of a reasonable size, it can detect very small differences in quality between two N-best translation lexicons.",
        "For example, BiBLE evaluations were used to find the precise optimum value for the LCSR cut-off in the Cognate Filter.",
        "BiBLE also helped to select the optimum tag set for the POS Filter.",
        "This kind of automatic quality control is indispensable for an engineering approach to better machine translation."
