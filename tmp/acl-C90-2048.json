        "Two general methodologies have been applied to the structuring of explanations: schemas ([McK85], [McC85], [Par87]) and rhetorical structure theory (RST) aHM891, [Hov88], [MP88], [MS88]).",
        "A schema is a discourse strategy that captures a typical pattern of discourse associated with a particular discourse purpose, (e.g., providing an analogy or evidence).",
        "Schemas can be thought of as templates composed of an ordered sequence of rhetorical predicates, which \"characterize the predicating acts a speaker may use and delineate the structural relation between propositions in a text.\" 2",

        "RST claims that, except for a small number of highly-stylized forms, all coherent texts have an RST decomposition.",
        "RST posits a small number of relations, comparable to McKeown's rhetorical predicates, that exist between segments of text.",
        "Because each relation has associated with it well-defined intended effects and conditions necessary for it to hold, RST lends itself well to a generation methodology based on a top-down, hierarchical planning formalism ([Sac77]).",

        "We contend that the characteristics exhibited by the primary segments of extended explanations, to be described in the next section, cannot be captured by recursive processes.",
