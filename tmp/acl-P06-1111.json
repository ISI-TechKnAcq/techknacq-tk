        "There has been a great deal of work on unsupervised grammar induction, with motivations ranging from scientific interest in language acquisition to engineering interest in parser construction (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Clark, 2001).",
        "Recent work has successfully induced unlabeled grammatical structure, but has not successfully learned labeled tree structure (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eis-ner, 2004) .",
        "In this paper, our goal is to build a system capable of producing labeled parses in a target grammar with as little total effort as possible.",
        "We investigate a prototype-driven approach to grammar induction, in which one supplies canonical examples of each target concept.",
        "For example, we might specify that we are interested in trees which use the symbol NP and then list several examples of prototypical NPs (determiner noun, pronouns, etc., see figure 1 for a sample prototype list).",
        "This prototype information is similar to specifying an annotation scheme, which even human annotators must be provided before they can begin the construction of a treebank.",
        "In principle, prototype-driven learning is just a kind of semi-supervised learning.",
        "However, in practice, the information we provide is on the order of dozens of total seed instances, instead of a handful of fully parsed trees, and is of a different nature.",
        "The prototype-driven approach has three strengths.",
        "First, since we provide a set of target symbols, we can evaluate induced trees using standard labeled parsing metrics, rather than the far more forgiving unlabeled metrics described in, for example, Klein and Manning (2004).",
        "Second, knowledge is declaratively specified in an interpretable way (see figure 1).",
        "If a user of the system is unhappy with its systematic behavior, they can alter it by altering the prototype information (see section 7.1 for examples).",
        "Third, and related to the first two, one does not confuse the ability of the system to learn a consistent grammar with its ability to learn the grammar a user has in mind.",
        "In this paper, we present a series of experiments in the induction of labeled context-free trees using a combination of unlabeled data and sparse prototypes.",
        "We first affirm the well-known result that simple, unconstrained PCFG induction produces grammars of poor quality as measured against treebank structures.",
        "We then augment a PCFG with prototype features, and show that these features, when propagated to non-prototype sequences using distributional similarity, are effective at learning bracket labels on fixed unlabeled trees, but are still not enough to learn good tree structures without bracketing information.",
        "Finally, we intersect the feature-augmented PCFG with the CCM model of Klein and Manning (2002), a high-quality bracketing model.",
        "The intersected model is able to learn trees with higher unlabeled F1 than those in Klein and Manning (2004).",
        "More impor",
        "tantly, its trees are labeled and can be evaluated according to labeled metrics.",
        "Against the English Penn Treebank, our final trees achieve a labeled F1 of 65.1 on short sentences, a 51.7% error reduction over naive PCFG induction."

        "We learned models on all or part of this data and compared their predictions to the manually annotated treebank trees for the sentences on which the model was trained.",

        "As an initial experiment, we used the inside-outside algorithm to induce a PCFG in the straightforward way (Lari and Young, 1990; Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999).",
        "For all the experiments in this paper, we considered binary PCFGs over the nonterminals and terminals occuring in WSJ10.",
        "The PCFG rules were of the following forms:",
        "• X – * Y Z, for nonterminal types X, Y, and Z, with Y 7� X or Z 7� X • X t Y, X – * Y t, for each terminal t • X t t', for terminals t and t' For a given sentence 5, our CFG generates labeled trees T over 5.2 Each tree consists of binary",
        "productions X(i, j) – * a over constituent spans (i, j), where a is a pair of non-terminal and/or terminal symbols in the grammar.",
        "The generative probability of a tree T for 5 is:",
        "In the inside-outside algorithm, we iteratively compute posterior expectations over production occurences at each training span, then use those expectations to re-estimate production probabilities.",
        "This process is guaranteed to converge to a local extremum of the data likelihood, but initial production probability estimates greatly influence the final grammar (Carroll and Charniak, 1992).",
        "In particular, uniform initial estimates are an (unstable) fixed point.",
        "The classic approach is to add a small amount of random noise to the initial probabilities in order to break the symmetry between grammar symbols.",
        "We randomly initialized 5 grammars using treebank non-terminals and trained each to convergence on the first 2000 sentences of WSJ-10.",
        "Viterbi parses were extracted for each of these 2000 sentences according to each grammar.",
        "Of course, the parses’ symbols have nothing to anchor them to our intended treebank symbols.",
        "That is, an NP in one of these grammars may correspond to the target symbol VP, or may not correspond well to any target symbol.",
        "To evaluate these learned grammars, we must map the models’ phrase types to target phrase types.",
        "For each grammar, we followed the common approach of greedily mapping model symbols to target symbols in the way which maximizes the labeled F1.",
        "Note that this can, and does, result in mapping multiple model symbols to the most frequent target symbols.",
        "This experiment, labeled PCFG x NONE in figure 4, resulted in an average labeled F1 of 26.3 and an unlabeled F1 of 45.7.",
        "The unlabeled F1 is better than randomly choosing a tree (34.7), but not better than always choosing a right branching structure (61.7).",
        "Klein and Manning (2002) suggest that the task of labeling constituents is significantly easier than identifying them.",
        "Perhaps it is too much to ask a PCFG induction algorithm to perform both of these tasks simultaneously.",
        "Along the lines of Pereira and Schabes (1992), we reran the inside-outside algorithm, but this time placed zero mass on all trees which did not respect the bracketing of the gold trees.",
        "This constraint does not fully",
        "eliminate the structural uncertainty since we are inducing binary trees and the gold trees are flatter than binary in many cases.",
        "This approach of course achieved the upper bound on unlabeled F1, because of the gold bracket constraints.",
        "However, it only resulted in an average labeled F1 of 52.6 (experiment PCFG x GOLD in figure 4).",

        "See section 7.3 for an experiment utilizing an automatically generated prototype list with comparable results.",
        "4I n our experiments we found that adding prototypes for more categories did not improve performance and took more bol in terms of an observable portion of the data, rather than attempting to relate unknown symbols to other unknown symbols.",
        "Broadly, we would like to learn a grammar which explains the observed data (EM’s objective) but also meets our prior expectations or requirements of the target grammar.",
        "How might we use such a list to constrain the learning of a PCFG with the inside-outside algorithm?",
        "We might require that all occurences of a prototype sequence, say DT NN, be constituents of the corresponding type (NP).",
        "However, human-elicited prototypes are not likely to have the property that, when they occur, they are (nearly) always constituents.",
        "For example, DT NN is a perfectly reasonable example of a noun phrase, but is not a constituent when it is part of a longer DT NN NN constituent.",
        "Therefore, when summing over trees with the inside-outside algorithm, we could require a weaker property: whenever a prototype sequence is a constituent it must be given the label specified in the prototype file.5 This constraint is enough to break the symmetry between the model labels, and therefore requires neither random initialization for training, nor post-hoc mapping of labels for evaluation.",
        "Adding prototypes in this way and keeping the gold bracket constraint gave 59.9 labeled Fl.",
        "The labeled F1 measure is again an improvement over naive PCFG induction, but is perhaps less than we might expect given that the model has been given bracketing information and has prototypes as a form of supervision to direct it.",
        "In response to a prototype, however, we may wish to conclude something stronger than a constraint on that particular POS sequence.",
        "We might hope that sequences which are similar to a prototype in some sense are generally given the same label as that prototype.",
        "For example, DT NN is a noun phrase prototype, the sequence DT JJ NN is another good candidate for being a noun phrase.",

        "In order to demonstrate that our system is somewhat language independent, we tested our model on CTB-10, the 2,437 sentences of the Chinese Treebank (Ircs, 2002) of length at most 10 after punctuation is stripped.",
        "Since the authors have no expertise in Chinese, we automatically extracted prototypes in the same way described in section 7.3.",
        "Since we did not have access to a large auxiliary POS tagged Chinese corpus, our distributional model was built only from the treebank text, and the distributional similarities are presumably degraded relative to the English.",
        "Our PCFG x CCM experiment gave 18.0 labeled F1 (43.4 unlabeled).",
        "The PROTO x CCM model gave 39.0 labeled F1 (53.2 unlabeled).",
        "Presumably with access to more POS tagged data, and the expertise of a Chinese speaker, our system would see increased performance.",
        "It is worth noting that our unlabeled F1 of 53.2 is the best reported from a primarily unsupervised system, with the next highest figure being 46.7 reported by Klein and Manning (2004).",
        "8 Conclusion We have shown that distributional prototype features can allow one to specify a target labeling scheme in a compact and declarative way.",
        "These features give substantial error reduction in labeled F1 measure for English and Chinese grammar induction.",
        "They also achieve the best reported unlabeled F1 measure.8 Another positive property of this approach is that it tries to reconcile the success of distributional clustering approaches to grammar induction (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002), with the CFG tree models in the supervised literature (Collins, 1999).",
        "Most importantly, this is the first work, to the authors’ knowl",
        "edge, which has learned CFGs in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting and can parse natural language language text with any reasonable accuracy.",
