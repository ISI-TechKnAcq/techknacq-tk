        "This demonstrator Senior Companion (SC) was built during the initial phase of the Companions project and aims to change the way we think about the relationships of people to computers and the internet by developing a virtual conversational 'Companion that will be an agent or 'presence' that stays with the user for long periods of time, developing a relationship and 'knowing its owners' preferences and wishes.",
        "The Companion communicates with the user primarily through speech, but also using other technologies such as touch screens and sensors.",
        "This paper describes the functionality and system modules of the Senior Companion, one of two initial prototypes built in the first two years of the project.",
        "The SC provides a multimodal interface for eliciting, retrieving and inferring personal information from elderly users by means of conversation about their photographs.",

        "It is assumed that most life information will soon be stored on the internet (as in the Memories for Life project:",
        "http://www.memoriesforlife.org/) and we have linked the SC directly to photo inventories in Facebook (see below).",
        "The overall aim of the SC project (not yet achieved) is to produce a coherent life narrative for its user from conversations about personal photos, although its short-term goals, reported here, are to assist, amuse and entertain the user.",
        "The technical content of the project is to use a number of types of machine learning (ML) to achieve these ends in original ways, initially using a methodology developed in earlier research: first, by means of an Information Extraction (IE) approach to deriving content from user input utterances; secondly, using a training method for attaching Dialogue Acts to these utterance and, lastly, using a specific type of dialogue manager (DM) that uses Dialogue Action Forms (DAF) to determine the context of any utterance.",
        "A stack of these DAFs is the virtual machine that models the ongoing dialogue by means of shared user and Companion initiative and generates appropriate responses.",

        "The Senior Companion prototype (Wilks, 2010) was designed to make a rapid advance in the first two years of the project so as to be basis for a second round of prototypes embodying more advanced ML.",
        "This strategy was deliberately chosen to avoid a well-known problem with experimental AI systems: that a whole project is spent in design so that a prototype never emerges until the very end, but which is then never fully evaluated and, most importantly, nothing is ever built on the experience obtained in its construction.",
        "The central function of the SC is engaging the user in discussion about their photographs: where and when they were taken, details about the people in them and their relationship to the user and each other.",
        "Once a photo is loaded, it is processed with face recognition software to identify any faces in it.",
        "The recognition software, OpenCV, provides positional information by identifying the face coordinates and this information is exploited in the Dialogue Manager by making explicit reference to the position of people in the photograph (the person on the left, right, center, etc.)",
        "as well as recognizing when there are groups of people.",
        "The system discusses properties of the photo as well as properties and relationships of the people in the photos.",
        "The news reading feature adds an interesting accompaniment to the photo domain and demonstrates the ability of the system to handle more than one kind of application at a time, and news has, of course, an unconstrained vocabulary.",
        "The following is a fairly typical example of its current capacity, depending of course on the images loaded, and comes from the middle part of a sample dialogue generated by the system when discussing a group photo from a vacation in Zanzibar, and after the system had already stored, from an earlier conversation, that the user has a daughter Zoe (using researchers' children to avoid any problems):",
        "SC: What is your relationship to the doctor7 User: There is no relationship.",
        "SC: Please tell me how you know the doctor U: Uh, he's a friend.",

        "I see.",
        "Octavia's sister is Zoe.",
        "SC: How old was your daughter Octavia when this photo was taken7 U: Octavia was 19 years old.",
        "SC: What was the occasion of this photo7 U: This was another family holiday.",
        "SC: Where was this photo taken7 U: This photo was taken in Tanzania.",
        "SC: have you ever been to Zanzibar7 U: Yes, I have.",
        "SC: Great place, I hope you saw the beaches.",
        "When was this photo taken7 U: last year.",
        "It is a key feature of the SC that it can make simple inferences from family relationships it already knows (e.g. that daughters of the same parent are siblings) and that it can access real-time information about places to show that it has some knowledge of what is being talked about, in this case the beaches on Zanzibar, and how this is done is discussed below.",
        "This real time access to unconstrained place information on the internet is an attempt to break out of classic AI systems that only know the budget of facts they have been primed with.",
        "This basic system provides the components for future development of the SC, as well as its main use as a device to generate more conversation data for machine learning research in the future.",
        "Key features of the SC are listed below followed by a description of the system architecture and modules.",
        "The SC:",
        "• Contains a visually appealing multimodal interface with a character avatar to mediate the system's functionality to the user.",
        "• Interacts with the user using multiple modalities - speech and touch.",
        "• Includes face detection software for identifying the position of faces in the photos.",
        "• Accepts pre-annotated (XML) photo inventories as a means for creating richer dialogues more quickly.",
        "• Engages in conversation with the user about topics within the photo domain: when and where the photo was taken, discussion of the people in the photo including their relationships to the user.",
        "• Reads news from three categories: politics, business and sports.",
        "Tells jokes taken from an internet-based joke website.",
        "Retains all user input for reference in repeat user sessions, in addition to the knowledge base that has been updated by the Dialogue Manager on the basis of what was said.",
        "Contains a fully integrated Knowledge Base for maintaining user information including:",
        "o Ontological information which is exploited by the Dialogue Manager and provides domain-specific relations between fundamental concepts.",
        "o A mechanism for storing information in a triple store (Subject-Predicate-Object) - the RDF Semantic Web format - for handling unexpected user input that falls outside of the photo domain, e.g. arbitrary locations in which photos might have been taken.",
        "o A reasoning module for reasoning over the Knowledge Base and world knowledge obtained in RDF format from the internet; the SC is thus a primitive Semantic Web device (see refernce8, 2008) Contains basic photo management capability allowing the user, in conversation, to select photos as well as display a set of photos with a particular feature.",

        "In this section we will review the components of the SC architecture.",
        "As can be seen from Figure 2, the architecture contains three abstract level components - Connectors, Input Handlers and Application Services together with the Dialogue Manager and the Natural Language Understander (NLU).",
        "Connectors form a communication bridge between the core system and external applications.",
        "The external application refers to any modules or systems which provide a specific set of functionalities that might be changed in the future.",
        "There is one connector for each external application.",
        "It hides the underlying complex communication protocol details and provides a general interface for the main system to use.",
        "This abstraction decouples the connection of external and internal modules and makes changing and adding new external modules easier.",
        "At this moment, there are two connectors in the system - Napier Interface Connector and CrazyTalk Avatar Connector.",
        "Both of them are using network sockets to send/receive messages.",
        "Input Handlers are a set of modules for processing messages according to message types.",
        "Each handler deals with a category of messages where categories are coarse-grained and could include one or more message types.",
        "The handlers separate the code handling inputs into different places and make the code easier to locate and change.",
        "Three handlers have been implemented in the Senior Companion system - Setup Handler, Dragon Events Handler and General Handler.",
        "The Setup Handler is responsible for loading the photo annotations if any, performing face detection if no annotation file is associated with the photo and checking the Knowledge Base in case the photo being processed has been discussed in earlier sessions.",
        "Dragon Event Handler deals with dragon speech recognition commands sent from the interface while the General Handler processes user utterances and photo change events of the interface.",
        "Application Services are a group of internal modules which provide interfaces for the Dialogue Action Forms (DAF) to use.",
        "It has an easy-to-use high-level interface for general DAF designers to code associated tests and actions as well as a low level interface for advanced DAFs.",
        "It also provides the communication link between DAFs and the internal system and enables DAFs to access system functionalities.",
        "Following is a brief summary of modules grouped into Application Services.",
        "News Feeders are a set of RSS Feeders for fetching news from the internet.",
        "Three different news feeders have been implemented for fetching news from BBC website Sports, Politics and Business channels.",
        "There is also a Jokes Feeder to fetch Jokes from internet in a similar way.",
        "During the conversation, the user can request news about particular topics and the SC simply reads the news downloaded through the feeds.",
        "The DAF Repository is a list of DAFs loaded from files generated by the DAF Editor.",
        "The Natural Language Generation (NLG) module is responsible for randomly selecting a system utterance from a template.",
        "An optional variable can be passed when calling methods on this module.",
        "The variable will be used to replace special symbols in the text template if applicable.",
        "Session Knowledge is the place where global information for a particular running session is stored.",
        "For example, the name of the user who is running the session, the list of photos being discussed in this session and the list of user utterances etc.",
        "The Knowledge Base is the data store of persistent knowledge.",
        "It is implemented as an RDF triplestore using a Jena implementation.",

        "The basic processes carried out by GATE are: tokenizing, sentence splitting, POS tagging, parsing and Named Entity Recognition.",
        "These components have been further enhanced for the SC system by adding 1) new and improved gazetteers including family relations and 2) accompanying extraction rules .The Named Entity (NE) recognizer is a key part of the NLU module and recognizes the significant entities required to process dialogue in the photo domain: PERSON NAMES, LOCATION NAMES, FAMILY RELATIONS and DATES.",
        "Although GATE recognizes basic entities, more complex entities are not handled.",
        "Apart from the gazetteers mentioned earlier and the hundreds of extraction rules already present in GATE, about 20 new extraction rules using the JAPE rule language were also developed for the SC module.",
        "These included rules which identify complex dates, family relationships, negations and other information related to the SC domain.",
        "The following is an example of a simple rule used to identify relationship in utterances such as \"Mary is my sister\":",
        "Macro: RELATIONSHIP_IDENTIFIER ({Token.string==\"is\"}) ({Token.string==\"my\"}):person1 ({Lookup.minorType==\"Relationship\"}):relation ship)",

        "This name is recognised by using the gazetteers we have in the system (which contain about 40,000 first names).",
        "The relationship is once again identified using the almost 800 unique relationships added to the gazetteer.",
        "With this information, the NLU module identifies Information Extraction patterns in the dialogue that represent significant content with respect to a user's life and photos.",
        "The information obtained (such as Mary=sister-of John) is passed to the Dialogue Manager (DM) and then stored in the knowledge base (KB).",
        "The DM filters what to include and exclude from the KB.",
        "Given, in the example above, that Mary is the sister of John, the NLU knows that sister is a relationship between two people and is a key relationship.",

        "Even though this information is important, it is too low level to be of any use by the SC with respect to the user, i.e. the user is not interested in the parts-of-speech of a word.",
        "Thus, this information is discarded by the DM and not stored in the KB.",
        "The NLU module also identifies a Dialogue Act Tag for each user utterance based on the DAMSL set of DA tags and prior work done jointly with the University of Albany (Webb et al., 2008).",
        "The KB is a long-term store of information which makes it possible for the SC to retrieve information stored between different sessions.",
        "The information can be accessed anytime it is needed by simply invoking the relevant calls.",
        "The structure of the data in the database is an RDF triple, and the KB is more commonly referred to as a triple store.",

        "Each triple is made up of a subject, a predicate and an object.",
        "So, if we took the previous example, Mary sister-of John; Mary would be the subject, sister-of would be the predicate and John would be the object.",

        "So, if the user informs the system that the photograph was taken in Paris, (in response to a system question asking where the photo was taken), the utterance is first processed by the NLU which discovers that \"Paris\" is a location using its semantic tagger ANNIE (A Nearly New Information Extraction engine).",

        "It also goes through the KB and retrieves any triples related to \"Paris\".",

        "The system already knows how to query these sites and interpret their output by using predefined wrappers.",
        "This is then used to extract relevant information from the mentioned sites webpages by sending an online query to these sites and storing the information retrieved in the triple-store.",
        "This information is then used by the DM to generate a reply.",
        "In the previous example, the system manages to extract the best sightseeing spots in Paris.",
