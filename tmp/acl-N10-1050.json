        "Machine translation relies heavily on word alignments, which are usually produced by training ibm-models (Brown et al., 1993) in both directions and combining the resulting alignments via some heuristic.",
        "Automatically training an Inversion Transduction Grammar (itg) has been suggested as a viable way of producing superior alignments (Saers and Wu, 2009).",
        "The main problem of using Bracketing itgs for alignment is that exhaustive biparsing runs in O(n) time.",
        "Several ways to lower the complexity of itgs has been suggested, but in this paper, a different approach is taken.",
        "instead of using full ITGs, we explore the possibility of subjecting the grammar to a linear constraint, making exhaustive biparsing of a sentence pair in O(n) time possible.",
        "This can be further improved by applying pruning."

        "A transduction is the bilingual version of a language.",
        "A language (Li) can be formally viewed as a set of sentences, sequences of tokens taken from a specified vocabulary (Vi).",
        "A transduction (Tef) between two languages (Le and Lf ) is then a set of sentence pairs, sequences of bitokens from the cross production of the vocabularies of the two languages being transduced (Vef = Vex Vf ).",
        "This adds an extra layer of complexity to finding transductions from raw bitexts, as an alignment has to be imposed.",
        "Simple (stg) and Syntax Directed (sdtg) Transduction Grammars (Aho and Ullman, 1972) can be used to parse transductions between context-free languages.",
        "Both work fine as long as a grammar is given and parsing is done as transduction, that is: a sentence in one language is rewritten into the other language.",
        "In nlp, interest has shifted away from hand-crafted grammars, towards stochastic grammars induced from corpora.",
        "To induce a stochastic grammar from a parallel corpus, expectations of all possible parses over a sentence pair are typically needed.",
        "Stgs can biparse sentence pairs in polynomial time, but are unable to account for the complexities typically found in natural languages.",
        "Sdtgs do account for the complexities in natural languages, but are intractable for biparsing.",
        "Inversion transductions (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) are a special case of transductions that are not monotone, but where permutations are severely limited.",
        "By limiting the possible permutations, biparsing becomes tractable.",
        "This in turn means that ITGs can be induced from parallel corpora in polynomial time, as well as account for most of the reorderings found between natural languages.",
        "An Inversion transduction is limited so that it must be expressible as non-overlapping groups, internally permuted either by the identity permutation or the inversion permutation (hence the name).",
        "This requirement also means that the grammar is bi-narizable, yielding a two-normal form.",
        "A production with the identity permutation is written inside square brackets, while productions with the inversion permutation is written inside angled brackets.",
        "This gives us a two-normal form that looks like this (where e/f is a biterminal):",
        "The time complexity for exhaustive itg biparsing is O(Gn), which is typically too large to be applicable to large grammars and long sentence.",
        "The grammar constant G can be eliminated by limiting the grammar to a bracketing itg (bitg), which only has one nonterminal symbol.",
        "Saers & Wu (2009) show that it is possible to apply exhaustive biparsing to a large parallel corpus (~ 100,000 sentence pairs) of short sentences (< 10 tokens in both language).",
        "The word alignments read off the Viterbi parse also increased translation quality when used instead of the alignments from bidirectional ibm alignments.",
        "The O(n) time complexity is somewhat prohibitive for large corpora, so pruning in some form is needed.",
        "Saers, Nivre & Wu (2009) introduce a beam pruning scheme, which reduces time complexity to O(bn).",
        "They also show that severe pruning is possible without significant deterioration in alignment quality.",
        "Haghighi et.",
        "al (2009) use a simpler aligner as guidance for pruning, which reduce the time complexity by two orders of magnitude, and also introduce block itg, which gives many-to-one instead of one-to-one alignments.",
        "Zhang et.",
        "al (2008) present a method for evaluating spans in the sentence pair to determine whether they should be excluded or not.",
        "The algorithm has a best case time complexity of O(n).",
        "In this paper we introduce Linear itg (litg), and apply it to a word-alignment task which is evaluated by the phrase-based statistical machine translation (pbsmt) system that can be built from that."

        "A Bracketing Linear Inversion Transduction Grammar (blitg) is a bitg where rules may have at most one nonterminal symbol in their production.",

        "where one but not both of the tokens in the biterminal may be the empty string e, if a nonterminal is produced.",
        "By associating each rule with a probability, we get a Stochastic blitg (sblitg).",
        "The sentence pair to be biparsed consists oftwo vectors of tokens (e and f).",
        "An item is represented as a nonterminal (X), and one span in each of the languages (es..t and fu..v).",
        "For notational convenience, an item will be written as the nonterminal with the spans as subscripts (XS)t)U)V).",
        "The length of an item is defined as the sum of the length of the two spans: |XS)t)U)V | = t – s + v – u.",
        "Items are gathered in buckets, Bn, according to their length so that Xs,t,u,v e B\\xs>t>u>v\\.",
        "The algorithm is initialized with the item spanning the entire sentence pair:",
        "Starting from this top bucket, buckets are processed in larger to smaller order: Bn, Bn_i,... ,B1.",
        "While processing a bucket, only smaller items are added, meaning that B0 is fully constructed by the time Bi has been processed.",
        "Each item in B0 can have the rule X - e/e applied to it, eliminating the nonterminal and halting processing.",
        "If there are no items in B0, parsing has failed.",
        "To process a bucket, each item is extended by all applicable rules, and the nonterminals in the productions are added to their respective buckets.",
        "Table 1 : Results for French-English.",
        "Note that there are two productions on each of the four last rows.",
        "These are distinct rules, but the symbols in the productions are identical.",
        "This phenomenon is due to the fact that the empty symbols can be \"read\" off either end of the span.",
        "In our experiments, such rules were merged into their non-inverting form, effectively eliminating the last four inverted rules (productions enclosed in angled brackets) above.",
        "Let n be the length of the longer sentence in the pair.",
        "The number of buckets will be O(n), since the longest item will be at most 2n long.",
        "Within a bucket, there can be O(n) starting points for items, but once the length of one of the spans is fixed, the length of the other follows, adding a factor O(n), making the total number of items in a bucket O(n).",
        "Each item in a bucket can be analyzed in 8 possible ways, requiring O(1) time.",
        "In summary, we have: O(n) x O(n) x O(1) = O(n)",
        "The pruning scheme works by limiting the number of items that are processed from each bucket, reducing the cost of processing a bucket from O(n) to O(b), where b is the beam width.",

        "The translation model is combined with a 5-gram language model (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Our experimental system uses alignments from the Viterbi parses, extracted during EM training ofan SBLITG on the training corpus, instead of GIZA++.",
        "Since EM will converge fairly slowly, it was limited to 10 iterations, after which it was halted.",
        "We used the French-English part of the wmt'08 shared task, but limited the training set to sentence pairs where both sentences were of length 20 or less.",
        "This was necessary in order to carry out exhaustive search in the sblitg algorithm.",
        "In total, we had 381,780 sentence pairs for training, and 2,000 sentence pairs each for tuning and testing.",
        "The language model was trained with the entire training set.",
        "To evaluate the systems we used bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and nist (Doddington, 2002)",
        "Results are presented in Table 1.",
        "It is interesting to note that there is no correlation between the number of phrases extracted and translation quality.",
        "The only explanation for the results we are seeing is that the SBLlTGs find better phrases.",
        "Since the only difference is the word alignment strategy, this suggests that the word alignments from SBLlTGs are better suited for phrase extraction than those from bidirectional IBM-models.",
        "The fact that sblitgs extract more phrases than bidirectional IBM-models under the grow-diag-x heuristics is significant, since more phrases means that more translation possibilities are extracted.",
        "The fact that sblitgs extract fewer phrases than bidirectional IBM-models under the intersect heuristic is also significant, since it implies that simply adding more phrases is a bad strategy.",
        "Combined, the two observations leads us to believe that there are some alignments missed by the bidirectional IBM-models that are found by the SBLiTG-models.",
        "It is also interesting to see that the pruned version outperforms the exhaustive version.",
        "We believe this to be because the pruned version approaches the correct grammar faster than the exhaustive.",
