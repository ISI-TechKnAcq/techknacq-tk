        "Landauer, P.W.",
        "Foltz, D. Laham, 1998).",
        "This technique can infer, from the matrix of co-occurrence rates of the words, a semantic space that reflects the semantic relations between words and phrases.",
        "This space has typically 300-400 dimensions and allows to represent words, phrases and entire texts in a vectorial form.",
        "In this way the semantic relation between two vectors can be estimated by their cosine (a measure that according to Kintsch can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient).",
        "This latter solution to the problem of the definition of LTWM puts a great and inevitable technical problem.",
        "How many objects must be retrieved from the semantic space for every word present in the text ?",
        "In some cases, when the textbase, i.e. the representation obtained directly from the text, is sufficiently expressed, the retrieval of knowledge from the LTM is not necessary.",
        "In other cases a correct comprehension of the text (or the relative situation model) requires the retrieval of knowledge from the LTM.",
        "After the creation of the LTWM the integration process begins i.e. the activation of the nodes correspondent to the meaning of the phrase.",

        "McClelland, D.E.",
        "Rumelhart, 1986).",

        "The adoption of a network of propositions for the knowledge representation presents certainly great advantages in comparison with the classic formalisms.",
        "While semantic networks, frames and scripts organize knowledge in a more ordered and logical way, the networks of propositions are definitely more disorganized and chaotic, but present the not negligible advantage that are capable to vary dynamically not only in time, on the basis of the past experiences, but also on the basis of the perceived context.",
        "But the technique worked out by Kintsch and Ericsson for the definition of LTWM presents some limits.",
        "Retrieving knowledge from the semantic space is only the first.",
        "Another problem is the evolution of the LTWM.",
        "The position occupied by a word in the LTWM is determined by the experience, i.e. its past use and this should be a lifetime experience.",
        "But this kind of knowledge cannot be reached practically and Kintsch resorts to the use of a dictionary for the definition of the semantic space that represents the LTWM.",
        "Furthermore the construction-integration process does not always assure the semantic disambiguation of the analysed phrase (W.Kintsch, 1998).",
        "The use of an external dictionary, as WordNet, (G. A. Miller, 1993) and of particular disambiguation procedures can overcome the last two limits.",
        "Instead the first problem can be fully solved only by dropping the intermediate representation of the semantic space and by developing new methods for the direct formation of networks of concepts and propositions.",
        "Let us describe now the system for the automatic acquisition of the knowledge that we developed on the basis of the LTWM model of Kintsch-Ericsson.",
        "The lack of adequate textual parsers able to convert the paragraphs of a text in the correspondent atomic propositions has driven us to develop, at least in this initial phase of our project, simple dynamic models of associative networks.",
        "The part of the document that is analysed (the content of the buffer) must be codified on the basis of the context before being elaborated by the working memory block.",
        "The context represents the theme, the subject of the processed text and for its correct characterization not only the information present in the document must be considered, but also the one that can be retrieved from the structure representing the knowledge accumulated during the analysis of the previous documents presented to the system (Long Term Memory).",
        "For the implementation of the working memory block, self organizing networks with suitable procedures for the labeling of their nodes could be used, but this solution requires a lot of computational time, especially for the analysis of entire repositories of documents.",
        "So we considered alternative models based on the theory of scale free graphs (R.Albert, A.L.Barabasi, 2001) for the implementation of an associative network.",
        "The graph theory dealed with regular graphs untill the 50s.",
        "Subsequently random graphs were introduced (P.Erdos, A.Renyi, 1959).",
        "They were the first simple forms of complex graphs that had ever been studied.",
        "Their model started with a network made by N isolated nodes.",
        "Successively each pair of nodes could be connected with a probability p, leading to a graph having approximately pN(N-1)/2 links.",
        "But this model was still far from real networks present in nature and artificial systems.",
        "So scientists defined other models characterized by an higher complexity level.",
        "The actual models have three main features.",
        "First their “small world” structure.",
        "That means there is a relatively short path between any two nodes (D.J.Watts, S.H.Strogatz, 1998).",
        "Second their inherent tendency to cluster that is quantified by a coefficient that was introduced by Watts and Strogatz.",
        "Given a node i of ki degree i.e. having ki edges which connect it to ki other nodes, if those make a cluster, they can establish ki(ki- 1)/2 edges at best.",
        "The ratio between the actual number of edges and the maximum number gives the cluster coefficient of node i.",
        "The clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of the all individual clustering coefficients.",
        "In a random graph the clustering coefficient is C = p. In real networks the clustering coefficient is much larger than p. Actual graph models are also characterized by a particular degree distribution.",
        "While in a random graph the majority of the nodes have approximately the same degree close to the average degree, the degree distribution P(k) of a real network has a power-law tail P(k)~k-�.",
        "For this reason these networks are called “scale free” (R.Albert, A.L.Barabasi, 2000).",
        "Recently it has been found that human knowledge seems to be structured as a scale free graph (M.Steyvers, J.Tenenbaum, 2001).",
        "Representing words and concepts with nodes, some of these (hubs) establish much more links compared with the other ones.",
        "In table 2 are reported the average shortest path length, the clustering coefficient and the power law exponent of two different types of semantic networks.",
        "This particular conformation seems to optimize the communication between nodes.",
        "Thanks to the presence of the hubs, every pair of nodes can be connected by a low number of links in comparison with a random network with the same dimensions.",
        "The definition and the eventual updating of a scale free network does not require a lot of time and the execution of particular processes, as the diffusion of the activation signal, is very fast.",
        "The textual analysis is performed through the following steps.",
        "The new text is analysed paragraph by paragraph.",
        "The buffer contains not only the words of the paragraph analysed, but also words retrieved from the long term memory using the diffusion of the activation procedure (the activation signal starts from the nodes in the LTM that represents the words in the paragraph).",
        "Theoretically, the buffer should contain also the words activated during the analysis of the previous paragraph, but this aspect has not been considered for its computational complexity.",
        "The buffer, the working memory and the activated part of the LTM block can be compared (but they are not the same structure) to the LTWM defined by Kintsch and Ericsson.",
        "During the acquisition of the content of the paragraph a stoplist of words that must not be considered (as articles, pronouns etc.)",
        "is used.",
        "For any word in the text, the paragraphs where it has appeared (or where it has been inserted after the retrieval procedure) are stored.",
        "When the entire text has been parsed and the data of all the N not filtered words have been memorized, the formation of the network of concepts in the working memory begins.",
        "The model adopted is similar to the one defined by Bianconi and Barabasi (G.Bianconi, A.Barabasi, 2001).",
        "The process starts with a net consisting of N disconnected nodes.",
        "At every step t=1..N each node (associated to one of the N words) establishes a link with other M units (M=5).",
        "If j is the selected unit, the probability that this node establishes a link with the unit i is: where ki is the degree of the unit i 1, i.e. the number of links established by it, while Ui is the fitness value associated to the node, and it can be computed as the ratio between the number of paragraphs that contain both i and j and the number of paragraphs that contain either i or j. LTM is an associative network that is updated with the content of the WM.",
        "Whenever a link of the WM corresponds to a link present in the LTM, the weight of this one is increased by “1”.",
        "Example : The WM links “Hemingway” to “writer”.",
        "In the LTM “Hemingway” is linked to “writer” with weight “7” and to “story” with weight “4”.",
        "In the updated LTM “Hemingway” is linked to “writer” with weight “8” and to “story” with weight “4” (unchanged).",
        "To perform the diffusion of the activation signal all the weights must be normalized.",
        "In this case “Hemingway” must be linked to “writer” with weight 8/(8+4) and to “story” with weight 4/(8+4).",
        "Since the scale free network that represents the content of the WM is used to update the content of LTM, this associative networks should take the form of a scale free graph.",
        "Unfortunately the modalities of evolution of the LTM does not allow the definition of a simple equivalent mathematic model, that is necessary to make useful previsions about its evolution.",
        "In the scale free graph models proposed by literature at each temporal step M new nodes are added to the graph, with M defined beforehand.",
        "These M nodes generally establish M links with M old units of the network.",
        "In the system that we have developed, after the analysis of a new document the links related to an unknown number of nodes of the LTM network are updated on the basis of the content of the WM.",
        "This number depends on the analysed document because it is the number of the words that have not been filtered by the stoplist.",
        "Another important difference with other scale free models presented in literature (S.N.",
        "Dorogovtsev, J.F.F.",
        "Mendes, 2001) is the particular fitness function that is used.",
        "This function does not depend on a single node but on the considered pair of nodes.",
        "If this value is choosen as proportional to the weights of the LTM associative network, the fitness value of a word is not constant but depends on the other word that could be linked to it.",
        "For example the noun “house” should present for the link with “door” a",
