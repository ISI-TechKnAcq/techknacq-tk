        "In comparison, the acquisition of second language has received little attention from the modeling community.",
        "Most of the child language acquisition models cannot be directly used for investigating how humans process and acquire foreign languages.",

        "The latter mostly simulate lexis and semantics acquisition (e.g., Li & Farkas, 2002; Li, 2009; Cup-pini, Magosso, & Ursino, 2013, etc.",
        "), and those that address a higher level of language structure usually do not model the existing L1 knowledge (e.g., N. C. Ellis & Larsen-Freeman, 2009; Rap-poport & Sheinman, 2005; but see Monner, Vatz, Morini, Hwang, & DeKeyser, 2013).",
        "At the same time, a number of theoretical SLA issues are not well explained yet, including general questions such as how existing knowledge of the first language influences the acquisition of second language.",
        "To give a specific example, it is not clear yet when L1 structures lead to interference and when they do not.",
        "In this paper, we use an existing model of early acquisition of argument structure constructions (Alishahi & Stevenson, 2008) and adapt it to bilingual input data, which allows us to investigate the acquisition process in second language learners.",
        "We demonstrate in a number of computational simulations that our model replicates natural L2 developmental patterns and two specific effects observed in human L2 learners, thus allowing us to make certain predictions about the issues under investigation."

        "There is an ongoing discussion in the literature on the supposed facilitatory effect of skewed input on constructional acquisition, summarized by Boyd and Goldberg (2009).",
        "In monolingual contexts, it has been demonstrated that children (Casenhiser & Goldberg, 2005) and adults (Goldberg, Casenhiser, & Sethuraman, 2004) acquire a novel construction with artificial verbs faster if one verb has higher token frequency in the input compared to the other verbs, and slower in case of balanced input, with all the verbs having equal token frequencies.",
        "As for SLA, N. C. Ellis and Ferreira-Junior (2009) showed that the distribution of verbs/constructions in input to L2 learners is Zip-fian, and that the most frequent verb in each construction is acquired first.",
        "However, they do not provide evidence for a facilitatory effect of skewed distribution on construction learning.",
        "At the same time, there is experimental evidence that high type frequency facilitates the acquisition of wh-questions in L2 (McDonough & Kim, 2009).",
        "Year and Gordon (2009) experimentally studied the facilitatory effect of skewed verb frequency in the input on L2 constructional learning.",
        "In their study, L1 Korean learners of English were presented with 5 English verbs in the ditransitive construction, where either all the verbs appeared equally often (balanced input), or one verb appeared 6 times more often than the other (skewed input).",
        "The learners?",
        "knowledge of the construction was assessed in the elicited production and acceptability judgement task.",
        "The exposure and testing procedures were distributed over 8 weeks, or over 4 weeks, or over 4 days, depending on the group.",
        "Surprisingly, in no group they found the evidence for the facilitatory effect of skewed input.",
        "These findings contrast with those in the other studies that we mentioned.",
        "In order to address this issue computationally, we ran simulations using our model.",
        "Unlike Year and Gordon (2009) who investigated the acquisition of one construction only, we assessed the general L2 knowledge of all constructions that the learner was exposed to, since our model is perfectly suited for this.",
        "The frequency distribution of verbs in our naturalistic L2 input was not uniform (79-81-61-5848-29), however the most frequent verb appeared approximately 3 times more often than the least frequent, which was not comparable to the ratio of 1:6 in the study by Year and Gordon (2009).",
        "Thus, in addition to the natural data we introduced two more conditions.",
        "First, we estimated the distribution of verbs over different constructions in our data and concluded that two verbs?go and show?accounted for most syntactic patterns in the input.",
        "Therefore, to prepare truly skewed input data, we set the frequencies for these two verbs to 30 and for the other verbs to 16.",
        "Second, we prepared the balanced input data by setting the frequency of each verb to 1.",
        "Using the three types of input, we ran the exact same simulations as for investigating the general developmental pattern, and compared the learner's L2 proficiency over time in the three conditions.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 5.",
        "balanced input As we can see, the learner's proficiencies with the natural and balanced input data do not differ much.",
        "However, the facilitatory effect of the skewed frequencies in the input is very evident.",
        "Thus, our findings constrast with the results of Year and Gordon (2009), but are in line with the general trend as summarized by Boyd and 6Although the ratio of 30:1 is much higher than that in the experiment being simulated, we had to account for the fact that individual frames within each verb were assigned their own frequencies, so a high-frequency frame of a low-frequency verb could still appear more often in the input than a low-frequency frame of a high-frequency verb.",
        "We excluded this possibility by setting the ratio to the high value.",
        "Goldberg (2009).",
        "We agree with Year and Gordon's (2009) explanation that the lack of facilitatory effect that they found can be explained by the presentation order of the high-frequency verbs.",
        "Goldberg et al. (2007) demonstrated the effect of the presentation order of high-and low-frequency stimuli on the learners?",
        "performance.",
        "We believe that due to the rather large ratio 30:1 that we set in the skewed data, the two high-frequency verbs prevailed in the L2 input from the very initial stage of L2 learning, therefore our simulations were closer to the ?skewed first?",
        "condition of Goldberg et al. (2007) than to the ?skewed random?",
        "condition.",
        "We have to note, however, that the facilitatory effect observed in our experiment could also be due to the fact that the distribution of the verbs in the test frames was also different for each of the three conditions, since the test data were sampled from the same distribution as the training data.",
        "We will further investigate this issue in the future."

        "Patterns of second language development have been studied for decades, starting from the morpheme learning studies in 1970s (e.g., Wode, 1976).",
        "Although some classroom studies allow SLA theorists to make inferences about general L2 developmental patterns (e.g., R. Ellis, 1994; VanPatten & Benati, 2010), scholars agree that a typical pattern of L2 development can hardly exist due to the inherent complexity of the SLA process.",
        "The enormous variability of L2 learning conditions makes it difficult to provide general conclusions about SLA development.",
        "Partly for this reason, most longitudinal studies have been focusing on the development of specific linguistic features in small number of individuals (see an overview by Ortega & Iberri-Shea, 2005).",
        "DeKeyser (2013) emphasizes the methodological difficulties in this domain, especially when it comes to studying age effects in the second language of immigrant population.",
        "The inherent problems of documenting the individuals?",
        "language experience and sampling those learners who match a number of specific criteria make the research in this field very laborious and time-consuming.",
        "In contrast, a computational framework can be effectively used for studying the complexities of learning a second language, specifically in relation to the characteristics of the first language.",
        "We present a computational model of second language acquisition which investigates grammatical L2 development in connection with the existing L1 knowledge, a setup that has not been properly addressed by the existing computational models of SLA (but see Monner et al., 2013).",
        "We evaluate the model's acquired grammatical knowledge (in the form of emergent argument structure constructions) through sentence production.",
        "Our simulations replicate the expected patterns of L2 development, such as gradual emergence of constructions and increased proficiency in sentence production.",
        "Moreover, we investigate two specific SLA phenomena: construction priming and the facilitative effect of skewed frequencies in the input.",
        "Priming effects have been demonstrated in second language learners (Gries & Wulff, 2005), although sometimes inconsistently (McDonough, 2006).",
        "We replicate a priming effect at the early stages of learning in our simulations, but this effect diminishes as the model receives more input.",
        "Systematic manipulation of various (potentially relevant) factors via computational simulation will shed more light on the nature of priming in SLA.",
        "The facilitative effect of skewed input on construction learning has been subject of much debate (Boyd & Goldberg, 2009).",
        "Our experiments show that skewed frequencies in the input can improve the performance of the model in sentence production, but more careful investigation of this pattern is needed for a clear picture of the interaction between different parameters.",
        "Although some of our results are inconclusive, we believe that our preliminary experiments clearly demonstrate the opportunities of the model for SLA research.",
        "In the future we plan investigating the described and other phenomena more thoroughly.",
        "Applying additional methods such as analysis of the frame categorization structure under different conditions, or quantitative comparison of the production data obtained in computational simulations and in the natural learner corpora (Gries & Wulff, 2005), could help us to draw specific implications for the SLA theory."
