        "In another comparative study (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2002) of five of the above WordNet-based measures, evaluated as part of a real-word spelling correction system, Jiang and Conrath (1997)'s similarity score performed best.",
        "Although performing relatively well under other evaluation criteria, these three measures seem less suited to measuring the kind of similarity occurring in coordinate noun pairs.",
        "One possible explanation for the unsuitability of the measures of (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) for the coordinate similarity task could be based on how context is defined when building context vectors.",

        "Words that form part of collocations such as disk drives or task force would then tend to have very similar contexts, and thus such word pairs, from non-coordinate modifier-head relations, could be given too high a similarity score.",
        "Although the difference between the mean similarity scores seems rather slight in all experiments, it is worth noting that not all coordinate head words are semantically related.",
