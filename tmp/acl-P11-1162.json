        "They employ patterns that specify the kind of information to be harvested, and usually bootstrap either the pattern learning or the term harvesting process (or both) in a recursive cycle, using data learned in one step to generate more seeds for the next.",
        "They therefore treat the source text corpus as a network, in which words are the nodes and relations linking them are the edges.",
        "The results of computational network analysis, especially from the world wide web, are thus applicable.",
        "Surprisingly, these results have not yet been broadly introduced into the computational linguistics community.",

        "Text mining / harvesting algorithms have been applied in recent years for various uses, including learning of semantic constraints for verb participants (Lin and Pantel, 2002) related pairs in various relations, such as part-whole (Girju et al., 2003), cause (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), and other typical information extraction relations, large collections of entities (Soderland et al., 1999; Etzioni et al., 2005), features of objects (Paşca, 2004) and ontologies (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "They generally start with one or more seed terms and employ patterns that specify the desired information as it relates to the seed(s).",
        "Several approaches have been developed specifically for learning patterns, including guided pattern collection with manual filtering (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) automated surface-level pattern induction (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichan-dran and Hovy, 2002) probabilistic methods for taxonomy relation learning (Snow et al., 2005) and kernel methods for relation learning (Zelenko et al., 2003).",
        "Generally, the harvesting procedure is recursive, in which data (terms or patterns) gathered in one step of a cycle are used as seeds in the following step, to gather more terms or patterns.",
        "This method treats the source text as a graph or network, consisting of terms (words) as nodes and inter-term relations as edges.",
        "Each relation type induces a different network.",
        "Text mining is a process of network traversal, and faces the standard problems of handling cycles, ranking search alternatives, estimating yield maxima, etc.",
        "The computational properties of large networks and large network traversal have been studied intensively (Sabidussi, 1966; Freeman, 1979; Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and especially, over the past years, in the context of the world wide web (Page et al., 1999; Broder et al., 2000; Kleinberg and Lawrence, 2001; Li et al., 2005; Clauset et al., 2009).",
        "Surprisingly, except in (Talukdar and Pereira, 2010), this work has not yet been related to text mining research in the computational linguistics community.",
        "The work is, however, relevant in at least two ways.",
        "It sometimes explains why text mining algorithms have the limitations and thresholds that are empirically found (or suspected), and it may suggest ways to improve text mining algorithms for some applications.",
        "In Section 2, we review some related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the general harvesting procedure, and follow with an examination of the various statistical properties of implicit semantic networks in Section 4, using our implemented harvester to provide illustrative statistics.",

        "The Natural Language Processing knowledge harvesting community has developed a good understanding of how to harvests various kinds of semantic information and use this information to improve the performance of tasks such as information extraction (Riloff, 1993), textual entailment (Zan-zotto et al., 2006), question answering (Katz et al., 2003), and ontology creation (Suchanek et al., 2007), among others.",
        "Researchers have focused on the automated extraction of semantic lexicons (Hearst, 1992; Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Girju et al., 2003; Paşca, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "While clustering approaches tend to extract general facts, pattern based approaches have shown to produce more constrained but accurate lists of semantic terms.",
        "To extract this information, (Lin and Pantel, 2002) showed the effect of using different sizes and genres of corpora such as news and Web documents.",
        "The latter has been shown to provide broader and more complete information.",
        "Researchers outside computational linguistics have studied complex networks such as the World Wide Web, the Social Web, the network of scientific papers, among others.",
        "They have investigated the properties of these text-based networks with the objective of understanding their structure and applying this knowledge to determine node impor-tance/centrality, connectivity, growth and decay of interest, etc.",
        "In particular, the ability to analyze networks, identify influential nodes, and discover hidden structures has led to important scientific and technological breakthroughs such as the discovery of communities of like-minded individuals (Newman and Girvan, 2004), the identification of influential people (Kempe et al., 2003), the ranking of scientists by their citation indexes (Radicchi et al., 2009), and the discovery of important scientific papers (Walker et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Sayyadi and Getoor, 2009).",
        "Broder et al.",
        "(2000) demonstrated that the Web link structure has a \"bow-tie\" shape, while (2001) classified Web pages into authorities (pages with relevant information) and hubs (pages with useful references).",
        "These findings resulted in the development of the PageRank (Page et al., 1999) algorithm which analyzes the structure of the hyperlinks of Web documents to find pages with authoritative information.",
        "PageRank has revolutionized the whole Internet search society.",
        "However, no-one has studied the properties of the text-based semantic networks induced by semantic relations between terms with the objective of understanding their structure and applying this knowledge to improve concept discovery.",
        "Most relevant to this theme is the work of Steyvers and Tenen-baum (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2004), who studied three manually built lexical networks (association norms, WordNet, and Roget's Thesaurus (Ro-get, 1911)) and proposed a model of the growth of the semantic structure over time.",
        "These networks are limited to the semantic relations among nouns.",
        "In this paper we take a step further to explore the statistical properties of semantic networks relating proper names, nouns, verbs, and adjectives.",
        "Understanding the semantics of nouns, verbs, and adjectives has been of great interest to linguists and cognitive scientists such as (Gentner, 1981; Levin and Somers, 1993; Gasser and Smith, 1998).",
        "We implement a general harvesting procedure and show its results for these word types.",
        "A fundamental difference with the work of (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2004) is that we study very large semantic networks built 'naturally' by (millions of) users rather than 'artificially' by a small set of experts.",
        "The large networks capture the semantic intuitions and knowledge of the collective mass.",
        "It is conceivable that an analysis of this knowledge can begin to form the basis of a large-scale theory of semantic meaning and its interconnections, support observation of the process of lexical development and usage in humans, and even suggest explanations of how knowledge is organized in our brains, especially when performed for different languages on the WWW."

        "Text mining algorithms such as those mentioned above raise certain questions, such as: Why are some seed terms more powerful (provide a greater yield) than others?, How can one find high-yield terms?, How many steps does one need, typically, to learn all terms for a given relation?, Can one estimate the total eventual yield ofa given relation?, and so on.",
        "On the face of it, one would need to know the structure of the network a priori to be able to provide answers.",
        "But research has shown that some surprising regularities hold.",
        "For example, in the text mining community, (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b) have shown that one can obtain a quite accurate estimate of the eventual yield of a pattern and seed after only five steps of harvesting.",
        "Why is this?",
        "They do not provide an answer, but research from the network community does.",
        "To illustrate the properties of networks of the kind induced by semantic relations, and to show the applicability of network research to text harvesting, we implemented a harvesting algorithm and applied it to a representative set of relations and seeds in two languages.",
        "Since the goal of this paper is not the development of a new text harvesting algorithm, we implemented a version of an existing one: the so-called DAP (doubly-anchored pattern) algorithm (Kozareva et al., 2008), because it (1) is easy to implement, (2) requires minimum input (one pattern and one seed example), (3) achieves very high precision compared to existing methods (Paşca, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2005; Paşca, 2007), (4) enriches existing semantic lexical repositories such as WordNet and Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007), (5) can be formulated to learn semantic lexicons and relations for noun, verb and verb+preposition syntactic constructions; (6) functions equally well in different languages.",
        "Next we describe the knowledge harvesting procedure and the construction of the text-mined semantic networks.",
        "For a given semantic class of interest say singers, the algorithm starts with a seed example of the class, say Madonna.",
        "The seed term is inserted in the lexico-syntactic pattern \"class such as seed and *\", which learns on the position of the * new terms of type class.",
        "The newly learned terms are then individually placed into the position of the seed in the pattern, and the bootstrapping process is repeated until no new terms are found.",

        "Similarly to the Web (Broder et al., 2000) and social networks like Orkut and Flickr, the text-mined semantic networks also exhibit a power-law distribution.",

        "This observation is consistent with Web degree distributions (Broder et al., 2000).",
        "The difference in the distributions can be explained by the link asymmetry of semantic terms: A discovering B does not necessarily mean that B will discover A.",
        "In the text-mined semantic networks, this asymmetry is caused by patterns of language use, such as the fact that people use first adjectives of the size and then of the color (e.g., big red car), or prefer to place male before female proper names.",
        "Harvesting patterns should take into account this tendency.",
        "Another relevant property of the semantic networks concerns sparsity.",

        "For the studied text-semantic networks, k is 1.08.",
        "Sparsity can be also captured through the density of the semantic network which is computed as V^1^.",
        "All networks have low density which suggests that the networks exhibit a sparse connectivity pattern.",
        "On average a node (semantic term) is connected to a very small percentage of other nodes.",

        "The above studies show that many of the properties discovered of the network formed by the web hold also for the networks induced by semantic relations in text mining applications, for various semantic classes, semantic relations, and languages.",
        "We can therefore apply some of the research from network analysis to text mining.",
        "The small-world phenomenon, for example, holds that any node is connected to any other node in at most six steps.",
        "Since as shown in Section 4.5 the semantic networks also exhibit this phenomenon, we can explain the observation of (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b) that one can quite accurately predict the relative 'goodness' of a seed term (its eventual total yield and the number of steps required to obtain that) within five harvesting steps.",
        "We have shown that due to the strongly connected components in text mining networks, not all elements within the harvested graph can discover each other.",
        "This implies that harvesting algorithms have to be started with several seeds to obtain adequate Recall (Vyas et al., 2009).",
        "We have shown that centrality measures can be used successfully to rank harvested terms to guide the network traversal, and to validate the correctness of the harvested terms.",
        "In the future, the knowledge and observations made in this study can be used to model the lexical usage of people over time and to develop new semantic search technology."

        "In this paper we describe the implicit 'hidden' semantic network graph structure induced over the text of the web and other sources by the semantic relations people use in sentences.",
        "We describe how term harvesting patterns whose seed terms are harvested and then applied recursively can be used to discover these semantic term networks.",
        "Although these networks differ considerably from the web in relation density, type, and network size, we show, somewhat surprisingly, that the same power-law, small-world effect, transitivity, and most other characteristics that apply to the web's hyperlinked network structure hold also for the implicit semantic term graphs – certainly for the semantic relations and languages we have studied, and most probably for almost all semantic relations and human languages.",
        "This rather interesting observation leads us to surmise that the hyperlinks people create in the web are of essentially the same type as the semantic relations people use in normal sentences, and that they form an extension of normal language that was not needed before because people did not have the ability within the span of a single sentence to 'embed' structures larger than a clause – certainly not a whole other page's worth of information.",
        "The principal exception is the academic citation reference (lexicalized as \"see\"), which is not used in modern webpages.",
        "Rather, the 'lexicalization' now used is a formatting convention: the hyperlink is colored and often underlined, facilities offered by computer screens but not available to speech or easy in traditional typesetting."
