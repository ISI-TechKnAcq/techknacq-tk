        "By considering four different target domains (news, medical, movie subtitles, technical documentation) in two source languages (German, French), we: (1) Ascertain the degree to which domain divergence causes increases in unseen words, and the degree to which this degrades translation performance.",
        "(For instance, if all unknown words are names, then copying them verbatim may be sufficient.)",

        "The only exception is the news domain, which is sufficiently similar to parliament proceedings (Europarl) that there are essentially no new, frequent words in news.",
        "By mining a dictionary and naively incorporating it into a translation system, one can only do slightly better than baseline.",
        "However, with a more clever integration, we can close about half of the gap between baseline (unadapted) performance and an oracle experiment.",
        "In most cases this amounts to an improvement of about 1.5 Bleu points (Papineni et al., 2002) and 1.5 Meteor points (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "The specific setting we consider is the one in which we have plentiful parallel (\"labeled\") data in a source domain (eg., parliament) and plentiful comparable (\"unlabeled\") data in a target domain (eg., medical).",
        "We can use the unlabeled data in the target domain to build a good language model.",
        "Finally, we assume access to a very small amount ofparallel (\"labeled\") target data, but only enough to evaluate on, or run weight tuning (Och, 2003).",

        "As expected, we shall see that unseen words pose a major challenge for adapting translation systems to distant domains.",
        "No machine learning approach to adaptation could hope to attenuate this problem.",
        "There have been a few attempts to measure or perform domain adaptation in machine translation.",
        "One of the first approaches essentially performs test-set relativization (choosing training samples that look most like the test data) to improve translation performance, but applies the approach only to very small data sets (Hildebrand et al., 2005).",
        "Later approaches are mostly based on a data set made available in the 2007 StatMT workshop (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), and have attempted to use monolingual (Civera and Juan, 2007; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009) or comparable (Snover et al., 2008) corpus resources.",

        "And the resulting feature vectors for each word are used for learning the CCA projections Since a word can have multiple translations, and that CCA uses only one translation, we form a bipartite graph with the training words in each language as nodes and the edge weight being the translation probability of the word pair.",
        "We then run Hungarian algorithm to extract maximum weighted bipartite matching (Jonker and Volgenant, 1987).",
        "We then run CCA on the resulting pairs of the bipartite matching to get the projection directions in each language.",
        "We retain only the top 35% of the eigenvectors.",
