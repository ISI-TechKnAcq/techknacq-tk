        "The final stage is the estimation of the part of speech of each extracted expression based on its context of occurence.",
        "Evaluation demonstrated that collocation measures alone are not effective in identifying target expressions.",

        "For natural language processing purposes, a naive definition of a word in English is 'a sequence of letters delimited by spaces'.",
        "By this definition, the expression ad hoc, which originally came from Latin, consists of two \"words\", ad and hoc.",
        "However, in isolation hoc is not a meaningful English word.",
        "It is always preceded by ad.",
        "This suggests that treating these two words as if they together form a single \"word with spaces\" more closely models their behaviour in text.",
        "A sequence of words which for one reason or another is more sensibly treated as a single lexical item, rather than as individual words, is known as a multiword expression (MWE).",
        "In other words, an MWE is a sequence of words which together behave as though they were a single word.",
        "MWEs are not limited to imported foreign phrases such as ad hoc.Theycover a large range of expression types including proper nouns such as New York,verb-particle constructions such as to call up (i.e. to telephone someone), and light",
        "* Supported by the Japanese government's MEXT scholarship programme.",
        "verbs such as to make a mistake.",
        "The justification for treating such expressions as MWEs is that their linguistic properties are odd in some way as compared to \"normal\" expressions: either their part of speech or their meaning is unpredictable despite full knowledge about the parts of speech or meanings of their constituent words.",
        "By fixed, we mean that this particular type of MWE consists of a contiguous sequence of words.",
        "Other MWE types can consist of discontinuous word sequences.",
        "For example, the verb-particle construction to call up takes an indirect object, the person who receives the telephone call.",
        "This person can appear after the verb-particle construction (e.g. \"I called up Mohammad\") but it can also appear in the middle of the verb-particle construction, (e.g. \"I called Mohammad up\").",
        "In contrast, fixed MWEs consist of contiguous word sequences.",
        "For example, by and large cannot be modified by insertion of other words (e.g. *\"by and very large\").",
        "The aim of our research is the development of a method for the automatic extraction and part of speech estimation of fixed MWEs.",
        "The ability to identify this type of MWE in texts is of potential use in a wide variety of natural language processing tasks because it should enable an improvement in the precision of sentence parsing.",
        "Sentence parsing is frequently the first step in more sophisticated language processing tasks, so an increase in parsing precision should improve results in a large number of natural language processing applications.",
        "A parser generally takes a sentence as input, together with the parts of speech of the tokens1 in the sentence.",
        "The parser then attempts to estimate the most probable syntactic structure for the sentence.",
        "Some kinds of MWE have the potential to disrupt this process because the part of speech of the MWE as a whole, cannot be predicted on the basis of the parts of speech of its constituent words.",
        "For example, the part of speech sequence for the expression by and large is Preposition + Conjunction + Adjective, which is a sequence almost certainly unique to this expression.",
        "A parser which is not explicitly informed about by and large will therefore struggle to cope with this part of speech sequence, and may incorrectly try to group one or more parts of the expression with words in the surrounding context.",
        "The solution to this problem of syntactically unpredictable MWEs is to add them to the dictionary used by the parser.",
        "When the parser comes across a sequence of words that matches an MWE in its dictionary, it can use the MWE's part of speech to parse the sentence treating the MWE as a single lexical item.",
        "Automatic Extraction of Fixed Multiword Expressions 567",
        "In reality, some sequences of words are an MWE only in specific contexts.",
        "For example, in the main is an MWE when it means \"overall\" or \"mostly\" as seen in the sentence \"In the main, the biggest improvements have been in child health\".",
        "In contrast, in a sentence such as \" Village hotels ought to be in the main square, not at the outskirts of a village\" the word sequence in the main is not an MWE, and can therefore be treated normally by the parser as separate words.",
        "We approach the task of extracting fixed MWEs by decomposing it into three sub-problems, as illustrated in Fig. 1.",
        "The first (ยง3.1, described in Section 3.1) is simple collocation extraction.",
        "We use a standard collocation measure to extract as many candidate bigram MWEs from the corpus as possible.",
        "Fig.",
        "1.",
        "Flowchart of processing",
        "The second problem (ยง3.2) is refinement of the list of candidate MWEs.",
        "Many of the candidates are not target multiword expressions.",
        "Distinguishing between word sequences that are MWEs, and those that never are, represents one sub-task.",
        "Hereafter, we refer to word sequences which are never MWEs as non-MWEs.",
        "Some word sequences have dual identities.",
        "In one context a word sequence may be an MWE, but in another, it may be just a normal, literal word sequence.",
        "For example, a child forced to help wash the family car, and acting petulantly, might be scolded \"Don't kick the bucket!\".",
        "In this case kick the bucket is a normal, compositional phrase; its meaning can be understood based on the literal meaning of its constituent words.",
        "When kick the bucket is used as a euphemism for \"to die\" however, its meaning is non-compositional, and thus in this context it is an MWE.",
        "In this paper we refer to occurrences of literal word sequences which have the appearance of being an MWE as pseudo-MWEs.We deal with these two subtasks simultaneously, using supervised machine learning.",
        "The third problem we tackle (ยง3.3) is estimation of the part of speech of MWEs.",
        "This problem is also solved using supervised machine learning.",
        "In this research we limit ourselves to MWEs containing only two words (i.e. bigrams).",
        "In the future, we plan to generalize the method so that it works with MWEs of arbitrary length."

        "Collocation extraction has been covered extensively in the literature.",
        "One of the earliest attempts to automatically extract collocations from a corpus was undertaken by Church and Hanks [1].",
        "The statistical measure they used to identify collocations was based on mutual information.",
        "Smadja [2] developed a tool called Xtract for the extraction of collocations.",
        "His definition of a collocation differed slightly from that of Church and Hanks because he claimed expressions such as doctors and nurses are not real collocations, just words related by virtue of their shared domain or semantics.",
        "Thanopoulos, Fakotakis and Kokkinakis in [3] reviewed the statistical measures most frequently used for collocation extraction, and evaluated them by comparing their performance with that of two new measures of their own.",
        "Their first novel measure, Mutual Dependency (MD) is pointwise mutual information minus self-information.",
        "The second measure attempts to introduce a slight frequency bias by combining the t-score with mutual dependency.",
        "Although frequency alone is not sufficient evidence of collocational status, they argue that candidate collocations that have a high frequency are more likely to be valid than those that are very rare.",
        "While collocations have received attention over a number of years, MWEs have only relatively recently emerged as a research topic within natural language processing.",
        "In consequence, there are relatively few articles specifically about MWEs.",
        "Sag et al.",
        "in [4] gave a linguistic categorisation of the different types of MWE, and described ways of representing them efficiently within a computational framework2.",
        "Although MWEs as a whole have yet to receive widespread investigation, attention has been paid to specific types of MWE.",
        "For example, verb-particle constructions have been the subject of several studies (see for example [5] and [6]).",
        "Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).",
        "Automatic Extraction of Fixed Multiword Expressions 569",
        "In order to extract information about fixed MWEs from a corpus, we use a three stage process.",
        "In the first stage we identify a list of candidate MWEs based on the statistical behaviour of the tokens in the corpus.",
        "Two words whose probability of appearing together is greater than that which would be expected based on their individual frequencies, are considered to constitute a potential MWE and are extracted for later processing.",
        "In other words, stage one is collocation extraction.",
        "In the second stage, we use this list of candidate MWEs as the basis for extracting from the corpus examples of candidates together with their contexts.",
        "These examples are then used as training data for supervised machine learning resulting in a classifier capable of distinguishing between, on the one hand, true MWEs, and on the other, non-MWEs and pseudo-MWEs.",
        "In the final stage we use supervised machine learning to train a classifier to perform MWE part of speech assignment.",
        "By examining the context surrounding an MWE, it is possible for the classifier to determine the most likely part of speech for the MWE in that context.",
        "Collocation extraction was performed using one of the statistical measures discussed in [3].",
        "The measures we experimented with were: frequency, x-square [7], log-likelihood ratio [8], t-score [7], mutual information (MI) [1], mutual dependency (MD - mutual information minus self-information) [3], and log-frequency biased mutual dependency (LFMD - a combination of the t-score and mutual dependency) [3].",
        "The equations of these measures are shown in Fig. 2.",
        "We compared the resulting ranked lists of bigrams with a list of target MWEs extracted from the British National Corpus (BNC)3.",
        "The target list was produced by starting with a list of all MWEs tagged as such in the BNC, and removing MWEs with a frequency of less than five, and MWEs with a part of speech of noun, or adjective.",
        "This reduction was performed for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, many MWE instances in the BNC can be considered noise in that they contain spelling variants, and features of spoken language.",
        "Secondly, a collocation consisting entirely of a combination of one or more nouns and adjectives is almost certainly a noun phrase, or part of a noun phrase.",
        "Noun phrases tend to be easily identifiable as such by parsers, and so are not relevant to our research aim.",
        "By removing the above MWEs we were able to reduce computational costs at later stages of processing.",
        "Verification was performed with the aim of extracting a much higher quality list of candidate MWEs from the list of candidate MWEs produced in the collocation stage.",

        "We also used the tokens in the candidate MWE itself and their parts of speech.",
        "The cutoff value of three is somewhat arbitrary, but most lexical dependencies can be assumed to be relatively local, so we can assume that it is large enough to capture the most useful information available from the context.",
        "Automatic Extraction of Fixed Multiword Expressions 571",
        "Contexts were not allowed to cross sentence boundaries.",
        "In cases where the available context surrounding a candidate MWE was shorter than the three token window, we inserted the appropriate number of dummy tokens and dummy parts of speech to fill up the deficit: \"BOS\" (Beginning Of Sentence) tokens in the left context, and \"EOS\" (End Of Sentence) tokens in the right context.",
        "Part of Speech Tagging.",
        "The part of speech information was provided by tagging the corpus using the part of speech tagger TnT4.",
        "The BNC is a part of speech tagged corpus, but retagging was necessary because although each MWE in the BNC is tagged with a part of speech, its constituent tokens are not.",
        "The tokens which make up each MWE must therefore be tagged with individual parts of speech.",
        "It might be argued that combining the original BNC tagging with the TnT tagging of the words in the MWEs would have produced more accurate training data, but in a real world application, the part of speech information in the classifier's input data will be produced entirely using a tagger such as TnT.",
        "By using the same part of speech tagger at both the training, and application stages, any systematic tagging mistakes will hopefully (at least in part) be learnt and compensated for by the classifier.",
        "The tagger was trained on a subset of BNC files containing just under 5.5 million tokens.",

        "Most of the bigrams in the corpus were negative examples, either non-MWEs, or pseudo-MWEs.",
        "We used TinySVM5 to create a binary classifier.",
        "Training was performed (using the software's default settings) on the training corpus.",
        "Several training runs were performed using different amounts of data in order to investigate the relationship between volume of training data and the resulting model's performance.",
        "Testing.",
        "Another sub-corpus of the BNC, independent of that used in training, was used for testing the classifier.",
        "This testing corpus contained approximately six million tokens and included texts from each domain in the corpus.",
        "We treated the estimation of the part of speech of a given MWE as a classification task using the same approach as we used for the classification of true and false MWEs.",
        "We trained a separate classifier for each target part of speech.",
        "A positive training example was an occurrence of an MWE with the target part of speech.",
        "A negative example was an occurrence of any MWE with a non-target part of speech.",
        "The features used were the token and part of speech of three tokens to the left and to the right of the target MWE, as well as the tokens and parts of speech of the words in the MWE itself.",
        "The training and testing corpora were the same as used at the verification stage described above (Section 3.2).",
        "This was acceptable because the two tasks are independent of each other.",
        "We chose the target parts of speech (adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions) because these relatively closed class, high frequency types are expected to be most useful in applications like parsing.",
        "We also experimented with an open class type (nouns) for comparison.",
        "Verbs could not be tested because there were insufficient numbers of them in the testing corpus.",

        "We also plan to check the effect on parsing accuracy of using the extracted multiword expressions in the input to a parser such as Collins' [9] or Yamada's [10].",
        "6Conclusion",
        "In this research we aimed to identify a method for the automatic extraction and part of speech estimation of fixed MWEs.",
        "Knowledge about fixed MWEs has",
        "Automatic Extraction of Fixed Multiword Expressions 575",
        "the potential to improve the accuracy of numerous natural language processing applications.",
        "Generating such a list therefore represents an important natural language processing task.",
        "Our method uses a collocation measure to produce a list of candidate bigrams.",
        "These candidates are then used to select training data for a classifier.",
        "The trained classifier was successfully able to distinguish between contexts containing a true MWE, from contexts containing a pseudo-MWE or no MWE at all.",
        "The classifier trained on one million example candidates identified using LFMD had precision of 96.56%, and recall of 89.11%, giving an F-measure of 92.69%.",
        "Part of speech classifiers were then trained and tested.",
        "The classifiers were able to identify the correct part of speech for an MWE with a precision and recall of over 95%.",
        "These results show that the local context surrounding an MWE contains sufficient information to identify its presence, and estimate its part of speech.",
        "If this information is detailed enough, we may be able to perform additional processing steps.",
        "For example, it may be possible to distinguish between specific subtypes of fixed MWE.",
        "The present method needs to be generalised so it can deal with MWEs of any length, not just bigrams.",
        "We plan to explore these issues in future research."
