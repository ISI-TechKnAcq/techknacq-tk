        "Annotated corpora of historical texts provide an important resource for studies of syntactic variation and change in diachronic linguistics.",
        "For example, the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English (PPCME) (Kroch and Taylor, 2000) has been used to show the existence of syntactic dialectal differences between northern and southern Middle English (Kroch et al., 2000) and to examine the syntactic evolution of the English imperative construction (Han, 2000).",
        "However, their utility rests on their having coverage of a significant amount of annotated material from which to draw patterns for such studies, and creating resources such as the PPCME require significant time and cost to produce.",
        "Corpus linguists interested in diachronic language studies thus need efficient ways to produce such resources.",
        "One approach to get around the annotation bottleneck is to use semi-automation.",
        "For example, when producing part-of-speech tags for the Tycho Brahe corpus of Historical Portuguese (Britto et al., 2002), a set of seed sentences was manually tagged, and the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) was then trained on those and consequently used to tag other sentences.",
        "The output was inspected for errors, the tagger was retrained and used again to tag new sentences, for several iterations.",
        "We also seek to reduce the human effort involved in producing part-of-speech tags for historical corpora.",
        "However, our approach does so by leveraging existing resources for a language's modern varieties along with parallel diachronic texts to produce accurate taggers.",
        "This general technique has worked well for bilingual bootstrapping of language processing resources for one language based on already available resources from the other.",
        "The first to explore the idea were Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), who induced a part-of-speech tagger for French and base noun phrase detectors for French and Chinese via transfer from English resources.",
        "They built a highly accurate POS tagger by labeling English text with an existing tagger (trained on English resources), aligning that text with parallel French, projecting the automatically assigned English POS tags across these alignments, and then using the automatically labeled French text to train a new French tagger.",
        "This technique has since been used for other languages and tasks, e.g. morphological analysis (Yarowsky et al., 2001), fine-grained POS tagging for Czech (Drabek and Yarowsky, 2005), and tagging and inducing syntactic dependencies for Polish (Ozdowska, 2006).",
        "This methodology holds great promise for producing tools and annotated corpora for processing diachronically related language pairs, such as Modern English to Middle or Old English.",
        "Historical languages suffer from a paucity ofmachine readable text, inconsistencies in orthography, and grammatical diversity (in the broadest sense possible).",
        "This diversity is particularly acute given that diachronic texts of a given language encompass texts and genres spanning across centuries or millenia with a plethora of extralinguistic influences to complicate the data.",
        "Furthermore, even in historically contemporaneous texts, possible dialectal variations further amplify the differences in already idiosyncratic orthographies and syntactic structure.",
        "The present study goes further than Britto et al.",
        "(2002) by fully automating the alignment, POS tag induction, and noise elimination process.",
        "It is able to utilize the source language to a greater degree than the previously mentioned studies that attempted language neutrality; that is, it directly exploits the genetic similarity between the source and target language.",
        "Some amount of surface structural similarity between a diachronic dialect and its derivatives is to be expected, and in the case of Middle English and Modern English, such similarities are not negligible.",
        "The automation process is further aided through the use of two versions of the Bible, which obviates the need for sentence alignment.",
        "The modern Bible is tagged using the C&C maximum entropy tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003), and these tags are transferred from source to target through high-confidence alignments aquired from two alignment approaches.",
        "A simple bigram tagger is trained from the resulting target texts and then used to relabel the same texts as Middle English training material for the C&C tagger.",
        "This tagger utilizes a rich set of features and a wider context, so it can exploit surface similarities between the source and target language.",
        "By training it with both the original (Modern English) Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal (WSJ) material and our automatically tagged Middle English Wycliffe material, we achieve an accuracy of 84.8% on predicting coarse tags, improving upon a 63.4% baseline of training C&C on the WSJ sentences alone.",
        "Furthermore, we show that the bootstrapped tagger greatly reduces the error rate on out-of-domain, non-Biblical Middle English texts.",
        "English provides an ideal test case for our study because of the existence of publically accessible diachronic texts of English and their translations in electronic format and because of the availability of the large, annotated Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English.",
        "The former allows us to create a POS tagger via alignment and projection; the latter allows us to evaluate the tagger on large quantities of human-annotated tags.",
        "We take two versions of the Bible as our parallel corpus.",
        "For modern English, we utilize the NET Bible.",
        "For Middle English (ME), we utilize John Wycliffe's Bible.",
        "The first five lines of Genesis in both Bibles are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The Bible offers some advantages beyond its availability.",
        "All its translations are numbered, facilitating assessment of accuracy for sentence alignment models.",
        "Also, the Bible is quite large for a single text: approximately 950,000 words for Wycliffe's version and 860,000 words for the NET bible.",
        "Finally, Wycliffe's Bible was released in the late 14th century, a period when the transition of English from a synthetic to analytical language was finalized.",
        "Hence, word order was much closer to Modern English and less flexible than Old English; also, nominal case distinctions were largely neutralized, though some verbal inflections such as distinctions for the first and second person singular in the present tense were still in place (Fennell, 2001).",
        "This places Wycliffe's Bible as far back as possible without introducing extreme nominal and verbal inflections in word alignment.",
        "The two Bibles were cleaned and processed for the present task and then examined for levels of correspondence.",
        "The two texts were compared for 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
        "2 Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water.",
        "3 God said, \"Let there be light.\"",
        "And there was light!",
        "4 God saw that the light was good, so God separated the light from the darkness.",
        "5 God called the light day and the darkness night.",
        "There was evening, and there was morning, marking the first day.",
        "1 In the bigynnyng God made of nouyt heuene and erthe.",
        "2 Forsothe the erthe was idel and voide, and derknessis weren on the face of depthe; and the Spiryt ofthe Lord was borun on the watris.",
        "3 And God seide, Liyt be maad, and liyt was maad.",
        "4 And God seiy the liyt, that it was good, and he departide the liyt fro derknessis; and he clepide the liyt, 5 dai, and the derknessis, nyyt.",
        "And the euentid and morwetid was maad, o daie.",
        "whether there were gaps in the chapters and whether one version had more chapters over the other.",
        "If discrepancies were found, the non-corresponding chapters were removed.",
        "Next, because we assume sentences are already aligned in our approach, discrepancies in verses between the two Bibles were culled.",
        "A total of some two hundred lines were removed from both Bibles.",
        "This processing resulted in a total of 67 books, with 920,000 words for the Wycliffe Bible and 840,000 words for the NET Bible.",
        "The Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English is a collection of text samples derived from manuscripts dating 1150-1500 and composed during the same period or earlier.",
        "It is based on and expands upon the Diachronic Part of the Helsinki Corpus of English Texts.",
        "It contains approximately 1,150,000 words of running text from 55 sources.",
        "The texts are provided in three forms: raw, POS tagged, and parsed.",
        "Among the texts included are portions of the Wycliffe Bible.",
        "They comprise partial sections of Genesis and Numbers from the Old Testament and John I.1-XI.56 from the New Testament.",
        "In total, the sections of Wycliffe annotated in PPCME have some 25,000 words in 1,845 sentences.",
        "This was used as part of the test material.",
        "It is important to note that there are significant spelling differences from the full Wycliffe text that we use for alignment - this is a common issue with early writings that makes building accurate taggers for them more difficult than for the clean and consistent, edited modern texts typically used to evaluate taggers.",
        "The PPCME uses a part-of-speech tag set that has some differences from that used for the Penn Treebank, on which modern English taggers are generally trained.",
        "It has a total of 84 word tags compared to the widely used Penn Treebank tag set's 36 word tags.",
        "One of the main reasons for the relative diversity of the PPCME tag set is that it maintains distinctions between the do, have, and be verbs in addition to non-auxiliary verbs.",
        "The tag set is further complicated by the fact that composite POS tags are allowed as in another_D+OTHER, midnyght^LDJ+N, or armholesJV+NS.",
        "To measure tagging accuracy, we consider two different tag sets: ptb, and coarse.",
        "A measurement of accuracy is not possible with a direct comparison to the PPMCE tags since our approach labels target text in Middle English with tags from the Penn Treebank.",
        "Therefore, with PTB, all non-corresponding PPCME tags were conflated if necessary and mapped to the Penn Treebank tag set.",
        "Between the two sets, only 8 tags, EX, FW, MD, TO, VB, VBD, VBN, VBP, were found to be fully identical.",
        "In cases where tags from the two sets denoted the same category/subcategory, one was simply mapped to the other.",
        "When a PPCME tag made finer distinctions than a related Penn tag and could be considered a subcategory of that tag, it was mapped accordingly.",
        "For example, the aforementioned auxiliary verb tags in the PPMCE were all mapped to corresponding subcategories of the larger VB tag group, a case in point being the mapping of the perfect participle of haveJKVN to VBN, a plain verbal participle.",
        "For coarse, the ptb tags were even further reduced to 15 category tags, which is still six more than the core consensus tag set used in Yarkowsky and Ngai (2001).",
        "Specifically, coarse was measured by comparing the first letter of each tag.",
        "For example, NN and NNS are conflated to N.",
        "The POS tagged Wall Street Journal, sections 2 to 21, from the Penn Treebank Release 3 (Marcus et al., 1994) was used to train a Modern English tagger to automatically tag the NET Bible.",
        "It was also used to enhance the maximum likelihood estimates of a bigram tagger used to label the target text."

      "text": [
        "Our approach involves three components: (1) projecting tags from Modern English to Middle English through alignment; (2) training a bigram tagger; and (3) bootstrapping the C&C tagger on Middle English texts tagged by the bigram tagger.",
        "This section describes these components in detail.",
        "Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) were the first to propose the use of parallel texts to bootstrap the creation of taggers.",
        "The approach first requires an alignment to be induced between the words of the two texts; tags are then projected from words ofthe source language to words of the target language.",
        "This naturally leads to the introduction of noise in the target language tags.",
        "Yarowsky and Ngai deal with this by (a) assuming that each target word can have at most two tags and interpolating the probability of tags given a word between the probabilities of the two most likely tags for that word and (b) interpolating between probabilities for tags projected from 1-to-1 alignments and those from 1-to-n alignments.",
        "Each of these interpolated probabilities is parameterized by a single variable; however, Yarowsky and Ngai do not provide details for how the two parameter values were determined/optimized.",
        "Here, we overcome much of the noise by using two alignment approaches, one of which exploits word level similarities (present in genetically derived languages such as Middle English and Present Day English) and builds a bilingual dictionary between them.",
        "We also fill in gaps in the alignment by using a bigram tagger that is trained on the noisy tags and then used to relabel the entire target text.",
        "The C&C tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003) was trained on the Wall Street Journal texts in the Penn Treebank and then used to tag the NET Bible (the source text).",
        "The POS tags were projected from the source to the Wycliffe Bible based on two alignment approaches, the Dice coefficient and Giza++, as described below.",
        "A dictionary file is built using the variation of the Dice Coefficient (Dice (1945)) used by Kay and Roscheisen (1993):",
        "Here, c is the number of cooccurring positions and NT (x) is the number of occurrences of word x in corpus T. c is calculated only once for redundant occurrences in an aligned sentence pair.",
        "For example, it is a given that the will generally occur more than once in each aligned sentence.",
        "However, even if the occurs more than once in each ofthe sentences in aligned pair sa and sb, c is incremented only once.",
        "v and w are placed in the word alignment table if they exceed the threshold value 6, which is an empirically determined, heuristic measure.",
        "The dictionary was structured to establish a sur-jective relation from the target language to the source language.",
        "Therefore, no lexeme in the Wycliffe Bible was matched to more than one lexeme in the NET Bible.",
        "The Dice Coefficient was modified so that for a given target word v Dv = argmax D(v,w) would be mapped to a corresponding word from the source text, such that the Dice Coefficient would be maximized.",
        "Dictionary entries were further culled by removing (v, w) pairs whose maximum Dice Coefficient was lower than the 6 threshold, for which we used the value 0.5.",
        "Finally, each word which had a mapping from the target was sequentially mapped to a majority POS tag.",
        "For example, the word like which had been assigned four different POS tags, IN, NN, RB, VB, by the C&C tagger in the NET Bible was only mapped to IN since the pairings of the two occurred the most frequently.",
        "The result is a mapping from one or more target lexemes to a source lexeme to a majority POS tag.",
        "In the case of like, two words from the target, as and lijk, were mapped thereto and to the majority tag IN.",
        "Later, we will refer to the Wycliffe text (partially) labeled with tags projected using the Dice coefficient as Dice_1to1.",
        "Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) was also used to derive 1-to-n word alignments between the NET Bible and the Wycliffe Bible.",
        "This produces a tagged version of the Wycliffe text which we will refer to as Giza_1toN.",
        "In our alignment experiment, we used a combination of IBM Model 1, Model 3, Model 4, and an HMM model in configuring Giza++.",
        "Giza_1toN was further processed to remove noise from the transferred tag set by creating a 1-to-1 word alignment: each word in the target Middle English text was given its majority tag based on the assignment of tags to Giza_1toN as a whole.",
        "We call this version of the tagged Wycliffe text Giza_1to1.",
        "Note that because the projected tags in the Wycliffe materials produced from the alignments are incomplete, there are words in the target text which have no tag.",
        "Nonetheless, a bigram tagger can be trained from maximum likelihood estimates for the words and tag sequences which were successfully projected.",
        "This serves two functions: (1) it creates a useable bigram tagger and (2) the bigram tagger can be used to fill in the gaps so that the more powerful C&C tagger can be trained on the target text.",
        "A bigram tagger selects the most likely tag sequence T for a word sequence W by:",
        "Computing these terms requires knowing the transition probabilities P(ti \\ti-1) and the emission probabilities P(wi\\ti).",
        "We use straightforward maximum likelihood estimates from data with projected tags:",
        "Estimates for unseen events were obtained through add-one smoothing.",
        "In order to diversify the maximum likelihood estimates and provide robustness against the errors of any one alignment method, we concatenate several tagged versions of the Wycliffe Bible with tags projected from each of our methods (Dice_1to1, Giza_1toN, and Giza_1to1) and the net Bible (and its tags from the C&C tagger).",
        "The bigram tagger learned from the aligned text has very limited context and cannot use rich features such as prefixes and suffixes of words in making its predictions.",
        "In contrast, the C&C tagger, which is based on that of Ratnaparkhi (1996), utilizes a wide range of features and a larger contextual window including the previous two tags and the two previous and two following words.",
        "However, the C&C tagger cannot train on texts which are not fully tagged for POS, so we use the bigram tagger to produce a completely labeled version of the Wycliffe text and train the C&C tagger on this material.",
        "The idea is that even though it is training on imperfect material, it will actually be able to correct many errors by virtue of its greater discriminitive power.",
        "We will refer to the version of the Wycliffe text (fully) tagged in this way as bootstrap."

        "The accuracy of the C&C tagger increases rapidly, and the accuracy exceeds our automated method on PPCME Test with just 50 labeled sentences and on the PPCME Wycliffe with 400 examples.",
        "This shows the domain of the target text is served much better with the projection approach.",
        "To see how much gold-standard PPCME Wycliffe material is necessary to beat our best bootstrapped tagger, we trained the tagger as in (g) of Figure 2 with varying amounts of material.",
        "Roughly 600 labeled sentences were required to beat the performance of 61.9%/68.5% (line (f), on both metrics).",
        "These learning curves suggest that when the domain for which one wishes to produce a tagger is significantly different from the aligned text one has available (in this and in many cases, the Bible), then labeling a small number of examples by hand is a quite reasonable approach (provided random sampling is used).",
        "However, if one is not careful, considerable effort could be put into labeling sentences",

        "Even though this accuracy figure is based on a reduced tag set smaller than the coarse used in this study, it is still a significant increase over that achieved here.",
        "However, their method had the advantage of working in a domain that overlaps with the training data for their POS tagger.",
        "Second, the the French tag set utilized in that study is considerably smaller than the Penn Helsinki tag set, a possible source of greater noise due to its size.",
        "Drabek and Yarowsky (2005) create a finegrained tagger for Czech and French by enriching the tagset for parallel English text with additional morphological information, which, though not directly attested by the impoverished English morphological system (e.g. number on adjectives), typically does appear in other languages.",
        "that are not optimal overall (imagine getting unlucky and starting out by manually annotating primarily Wycliffe sentences).",
        "The automated methods we present here start producing good taggers immediately, and there is much room for improving them further.",
        "Additionally, they could be used to aid manual annotation by proposing high-confidence labels even before any annotation has begun."

      "text": [
        "The purpose of the study was to implement a POS tagger for diachronic texts of maximal accuracy with minimal cost in terms of labor, regardless of the shortcuts taken.",
        "Such taggers are the building blocks in the design of higher level tools which depend on POS data such as morphological analyzers and parsers, all of which are certain to contribute to diachronic language studies and genetic studies of language change.",
        "We showed that using two conservative methods for projecting tags through alignment significantly improves bigram POS tagging accuracies over a baseline of applying a Modern English tagger to Middle English text.",
        "Results were improved further by training a more powerful maximum entropy tagger on the predictions of the bootstrapped bigram tagger, and we observed a further, small boost by using Modern English tagged material in addition to the projected tags when training the maximum entropy tagger.",
        "Nonetheless, our results show that there is still much room for improvement.",
        "A manually annotated training set of 400-800 sentences surpassed our best bootstrapped tagger.",
        "However, it should be noted that the learning curve approach was based on domain neutral, fully randomized, incremental texts, which are not easily replicated in real world applications.",
        "The domain effect is particularly evident in training on the sample Wycliffe and tagging on the test PPCME set.",
        "Of course, our approach can be integrated with one based on annotation by using our bootstrapped taggers to perform semi-automated annotation, even before the first human-annotated tag has been labeled.",
        "It is not certain how our method would fare on the far more numerous parallel diachronic texts which do not come prealigned.",
        "It is also questionable whether it would still be robust on texts predating Middle English, which might as well be written in a foreign language when compared to Modern English.",
        "These are all limitations that need to be explored in the future.",
        "Immediate improvements can be sought for the algorithms themselves.",
        "By restricting the mapping of words to only one POS tag in the Wycliffe Bible, this seriously handicapped the utility of a bigram tagger.",
        "It should be relatively straightforward to transfer the probability mass of multiple POS tags in a modern text to corresponding words in a diachronic text and include this modified probability in the bigram tagger.",
        "When further augmented for automatic parameter adjustment with the forward-backward algorithm, accuracy rates might increase further.",
        "Furthermore, different algorithms might be better able to take advantage of similarities in orthography and syntactic structure when constructing word alignment tables.",
        "Minimum Edit Distance algorithms seem particularly promising in this regard.",
        "Finally, it is evident that the utility of the Bible as a potential resource of parallel texts has largely gone untapped in NLP research.",
        "Considering that it has probably been translated into more languages than any other single text, and that this richness of parallelism holds not only for synchrony but di-achrony, its usefulness would apply not only to the most immediate concern of building language tools for many of the the world's underdocumented languages, but also to cross-linguistic studies of unprecedented scope at the level of language genera.",
        "This study shows that despite the fact that any two Bibles are rarely in a direct parallel relation, standard NLP methods can be applied with success.",
