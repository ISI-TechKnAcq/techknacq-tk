        "The challenges of irony processing involve the following issues: (1) No comprehensive irony corpus is available.",
        "(2) Irony analysis is related to semantics, pragmatics and discourse studies, which are the most challenging in natural language processing.",
        "(3) Contextual information and background knowledge are necessary, but they are hard to obtain and process.",
        "(4) Non-linguistic or non-verbal fac-tors, e.g., intonations, gestures and talking speed in speech, and spaces, punctuations and typography in writing, have to be considered.",

        "(1) Which patterns should be used is decided.",
        "At the very beginning of the bootstrapping procedure, the [degree adverb + positive adjective] pattern mentioned above is used.",
        "(2) Messages containing the patterns in step (1) are automatically retrieved from the candidates.",
        "NTUSD is used to determine sentiment polarity, and CKIP parser is used to get parts of speech2.",
        "(3) Messages retrieved in step (2) were reviewed by the annotator to decide which of them are actually ironic.",
        "(4) If the annotator finds new irony patterns in the reviewed messages, then the procedure starts again from step (1) and uses the patterns to repeat the process.",
        "This process was repeated for four times.",
        "After the fourth iteration, no more new patterns were found by the annotator.",
        "Finally, 2,825 messages are found to have any of the patterns, and 1,005 of them are confirmed to be ironic and make up the NTU Irony Corpus.3 Examples of these patterns and ironic messages are shown in Section 4.",
        "4 Irony Patterns All the patterns mined by the approach used in Section 3 are categorized into the following five groups.",

        "1271 (a) Degree adverb phrase + positive adjective phrase (b) Negative context The negative context can occur either before or after the component (a).",
        "For example, the following expression is used when someone has to wait for a long time to start ordering in a restaurant.",
        "In total, 13.03% of all the messages in the corpus contain this pattern.",
        "(s1) ????????????????",
        "I have to wait for half an hour to order.",
        "The service is definitely really good.",
        "The underlined expression is the contextual information described in (b), and the double-underlined expression is the linguistic form described in (a).",
        "In the second clause the adverbs ???",
        "(h?i) and ???",
        "(really) are combined to form a degree adverb phrase for intensification or hyperbole.",
        "Although the positive word good is used, the speaker means the opposite.",
        "The first clause indicates why they think the service is not good, and, therefore, provides the contextual information.",
        "4.2 The Use of Positive Adjective with High Intensity In this pattern, the following two components must exist: (a) Positive adjective with high intensity (b) Negative context Specific positive adjectives with high intensity are used to form ironic expressions with or without other rhetorical elements.",
        "Since the context is negative, the positive adjective is used to express non-literal meanings.",
        "The adjectives we found in the corpus include ????",
        "(great), ?????",
        "(remarkable) and ????",
        "(genius).",
        "Only 2.09% of the messages in the corpus contain this pattern.",
        "For example, the word great is used in the following message: (s2) ??",

        "My Plurk account encountered an unknown error ?again??",
        "This is indeed the greatest invention in the century.",
        "4.3 The Use of Positive Noun with High Intensity In this pattern, the following two components must exist: (a) Positive noun with high intensity (b) Negative context Specific nouns that represent highly positive meanings are also used to express irony.",
        "These nouns include ????",
        "(superstar), ????",
        "(big gift) and ????",
        "(wonderful state).",
        "When they are used with a negative context, an ironic expression is formed.",
        "This is pattern is not found frequently in the corpus.",
        "Only 2.00% of the messages in the corpus contain this pattern.",
        "An example is listed below: (s3) ?????????.......?????",
        "The big gift I received in the Mid Autumn Festival was??",
        "a lot of fat in my body.",
        "4.4 The Use of ????",
        "(very good) In this pattern, the following two components must exist: (a) Sentence boundary + ??",
        "+ punctuation (b) Negative context 1272 A sentence boundary occurs before the word ????",
        "(very good) because there is no subject.",
        "Multiple punctuations, and particularly exclamation marks and ellipses, can be used after ????",
        "to increase the intensity.",
        "In the following example, exclamation marks are used: (s4) ??...",
        "??!!",
        "??????",
        "I caught a cold?",
        "Very good!!",
        "My vacation is gone.",
        "Sometimes this pattern is followed by an exclamation word, such as ???",
        "(a), ???",
        "(ya), and ???",
        "(ma).",
        "These exclamations, like punctuations, can help strengthen the level of the speaker's feelings.",
        "In our irony corpus, this pattern is used in 50.84% of all ironic messages.",
        "Obviously, this is a common way when people want to express their negative feelings with an ironic expression.",
        "4.5 ????????",
        "(It's okay to be worse) In this pattern, the following expression must exist: ???",
        "+ negative adjective + ??",
        "(It is okay to be more + negative adjective) This pattern literally states that it is okay for something to become worse and is a commonly used pattern to express irony in our corpus.",
        "It can be found in 33.53% of the messages in the corpus.",
        "In most cases, even when no proper contextual information is present, the listener can tell the literal meaning is not meant because it violates most people's inclinations.",
        "Thus, the use of this pattern is usually non-literal and ironic.",
        "An example is shown below.",
        "(s5) ?????...???????",
        "It's -11?C?It is okay to be colder A message can contain more than one pattern, causing the sum of the percentages of the above five patterns to be greater than 100%.",
        "For example, both patterns 4.4 and 4.5 are used in the following message: (s6)??!!!!???????",
        "?????...",
        "Very Good!!!!",
        "It is okay for me to be more idiotic?",
        "The patterns in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 are mainly based on their linguistic forms and frequently used in ironic expressions.",
        "We argue that these patterns are more static than the others, and we call them the customary patterns.",
        "On the other hand, the patterns in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are called non-customary patterns.",
        "5 Collecting Ironic Expressions from Blogs In order to understand how irony is conveyed in different types of media, we use the methodology and mined patterns described in Sections 3 and 4 to collect irony expressions from the Yahoo Kimo Blogs corpus.",
        "5.1 The Yahoo Blog Corpus The Yahoo Kimo Blog corpus, referred to the Yahoo corpus in the following sections, contains blog articles from November 1, 2005 to August 20, 2007 (Yang, Lin and Chen, 2009).",
        "Out of all the posts in the dataset, 2,764,202 posts have at least one emoticon.",
        "The articles posted in July 2006 are used here, and they are divided into 341,932 smaller units by the full stop symbol.",
        "All articles are in Traditional Chinese.",
        "Since the Plurk platform can be used as an instant messaging system, and readers of the message are usually on the author's friend list, these messages are usually conversational.",
        "On the other hand, Ya-1273 hoo blogs are not limited in length and a blog article itself is not part of the conversation.",
        "Thus, the blog articles are usually more formal compared to microblog messages.",
        "Although the articles are separated by a full stop into shorter units, these units are not necessarily identical to sentences due to the conventional usage of the Chinese period symbol.",
        "They can consist of multiple sentences and thus contain a discourse structure, which makes them suitable for this corpus study.",
        "5.2 Extract Ironic Expressions A similar approach to the steps described in Section 3.3, is used to collect ironic expressions from the Yahoo corpus, but four patterns of irony found in Plurk are used to perform step (1).",
        "These patterns, as listed below, are adopted because they are the most frequently used ones in our Plurk irony corpus.",
        "They can also reflect the uses of customary and non-customary irony patterns as the first two patterns are customary, and the last two are non-customary.",
        "Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 are the same patterns as mentioned in Section 4.4 and Section 4.5, respectively.",
        "Pattern 3 and Pattern 4 are two forms from the pattern described in Section 4.1.",
        "Only step (1) to step (3) are performed, and step (4) is bypassed; that is, the process is not repeated.",
        "Pattern 1: (a) Sentence boundary + ??",
        "+ punctuation (b) Negative context Pattern 2: ???",
        "+ negative adjective + ??",
        "Pattern 3: (a) ??",
        "+ positive adjective (b) Negative context Pattern 4: (a) ??",
        "+ positive expression (b) Negative context 5.3 Results and Discussion A total of 36 ironic texts is obtained.",
        "All the four irony patterns seen in Plurk can be found in Yahoo.",
        "The final results are shown in Table 1.",
        "Number of Ironic Expressions Percentage Pattern 1 14 38.89% Pattern 2 10 27.78% Pattern 3 5 13.89% Pattern 4 7 19.44% Table 1: Ironic texts found for the four Patterns in Yahoo.",
        "The proportions of the four patterns in Plurk and Yahoo are also compared.",
        "The percentages are calculated by dividing the occurrence of each pattern by the occurrence of all four patterns in the same datasets.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1, the proportions of patterns (1) and (2) in Plurk are significantly higher than in Yahoo, and the proportions of patterns (3) and (4) in Plurk are significantly lower than in Yahoo (p<0.05 according to the t-test).",
        "This suggests that patterns (1) and (2) tend to be used in informal and conversational texts while patterns (3) and (4) tend to be used in formal articles to convey irony.",
        "Also, this may suggest that customary patterns are more likely to be used in conversations, and authors of formal articles prefer an indirect way to express irony, although more data are required for further studies in the future.",

        "6 Error Analysis In this section, we analyze why non-ironic messages were retrieved by the automatic processes.",
        "The 1,820 wrong messages specified in Section 3.3 are classified into the following two categories.",
        "(1) Sentiment identification Using the patterns to find possible ironic messages involves the correct sentiment identification.",
        "NTUSD does not cover some new words used on Internet informal conversations.",
        "The sentiment of a word can also be changed depending on its context.",
        "For example, ????",
        "(so strong) is listed as a positive term in NTUSD.",
        "However, it is used to indicate a negative condition in the example (s7).",
        "(s7) ??????????????????",
        "The side effect of the pain reliever was so strong, making me sleep through the whole night.",
        "(2) Opinion targets In a Plurk message, even though the message poster is talking about the same topic, more than one entity with associated opinions can be present.",
        "For example: (s8) ????????????",
        "The business of our company is running so well.",
        "I am so tired.",
        "The poster expresses negative sentiment by using the word ?tired.?",
        "Although the positive word ??",
        "??",
        "(very good) is also used, it modifies the word ?business?",
        "rather than the poster's condition.",
        "That is, the opinion targets of the two words are different, and this causes problems when automatically retrieving ironic messages.",
        "7 Linguistic Structure of Irony In this section, the linguistic structure of irony is analyzed based on our observations on the corpus.",
        "7.1 Ironic Word As described, the literal meaning of an ironic word or phrase is opposite to the actual meaning.",
        "An ironic word/phrase is necessary to separate irony from regular utterances.",
        "If the ironic word of an utterance is reverted, the speaker's actual sentiment or intention is reconstructed.",
        "However, it is not easy to identify the ironic word in an utterance.",
        "Sometimes more than one word can be an ironic word.",
        "In our corpus, 94.93% of the ironic words are adjectives, while others are used as adverbs, verbs or nouns.",
        "The recognition of ironic word/phrase is a challenging task, but other ironic elements described in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 can be analyzed side by side to help improve the performance.",
        "7.2 Contextual Information Contextual information is usually provided as part of ironic utterances to help convey irony.",
        "For example, the underlined sentence in the following utterance is crucial for irony interpretation: 1275 (s9) ???????????",
        "I was injured.",
        "I was really lucky.",
        "Without the first sentence, it is hard to tell if lucky is actually meant.",
        "Although a speaker can still use ironic words/phrases without providing contextual information, this can be an ineffective way to communicate the actual meanings of irony.",
        "According to the cooperative principle proposed by Grice (1975), the speaker must give enough information in order to enable successful communication and implicatures.",
        "The four maxims of the cooperative principle include: (1) Maxim of Quantity: The speaker should make their contribution as informative as is required.",
        "Do not make the contribution more informative than is required.",
        "(2) Maxim of Quality: The speaker should not say what they believe to be false, and should not say that for which they lack adequate evidence.",
        "(3) Maxim of Relation: The speaker should be relevant.",
        "(4) Maxim of Manner: The speaker should avoid obscurity of expression, avoid ambiguity, be brief and be orderly.",
        "Based on Grice's maxims, it is assumed enough, correct, relevant, and understandable contextual information should be provided with ironic expressions.",
        "However, the speaker sometimes assumes the listener already knows about the conditions where the irony takes place and has the required background knowledge; thus the contextual information is hidden in the ironic utterance.",
        "Four types of context can be used to interpret irony: (1) Linguistic context: The linguistic context refers to the words that are expressed before and/or after the irony words in a sentence or discourse.",
        "It is easier to obtain and analyze than the other three types of context.",
        "(2) Physical context: Physical context refers to what is actually present and/or happening in the environment or circumstance where the conversation is taking place.",
        "It is also related to the timing.",
        "In online conversations, participants are not usually in the same location, but they can be aware of the same ongoing events and situations.",
        "It is not necessary for the speaker to provide physical context information if they assume the objects or situations are noticeable to the listeners.",
        "(3) Epistemic context: The background knowledge shared by the participants in a conversion can also be used to interpret the irony.",
        "This type of context does not change over time.",
        "For example, people know rocks are hard, so they can understand the expression the bed is as soft as a rock is not literal.",
        "(4) Social context: Social relationship can be important for expressing and interpreting irony, especially in online messages.",
        "We argue that at least one type of contextual information must exist, but it can be hidden if the speaker thinks the listener is already aware of it.",
        "Physical, epistemic and social context can be hidden, while linguistic contextual information must be present.",
        "7.3 Rhetoric As shown in Section 4, degree adverbs, punctuations and exclamations can be used to convey irony.",
        "Some of them can even be repeated to intensify the effects.",
        "These elements increase contradiction and strengthen the degree of negative opinions.",
        "Unlike ironic words and context, rhetoric elements are not necessary to convey irony.",
        "Liebrecht et al. (2013) call the words used to strengthen evaluative utterances intensifiers.",
        "In their experiments, non-hyperbolic sarcastic messages often contain an explicit marker on Twitter.",
        "They argue that sarcasm is often signaled by hyperbolic words, including intensifiers and exclamations, and sarcastic utterances with hyperbolic words are easier to identify by listeners/readers than sarcastic utterances without hyperbolic words.",
        "It can be seen that adverbs, adjectives, punctuations and exclamations with high intensity observed in our irony patterns have very similar effects.",
        "Among the 113 messages containing the #??",
        "(#irony) hashtag in Weibo, which was mentioned in Section 2, 83.19% do not exhibit hyperbole or uses of intensifiers.",
        "This observation is similar to the argument suggested in Liebrecht et al. (2013) and is one of the reasons why the hashtag is not suitable 1276 for the irony pattern mining task in this study.",
        "In comparison, this methodology helps find more clues of irony that can be seen from their linguistic forms.",
        "7.4 Corpus Labeling To increase the usefulness of the corpus, ironic element tags are added to each message.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 2: An example message with ironic element tags.",
        "As can be seen in the example, ???",
        "(good) is the word that is used in the opposite way, so it is marked with the ironic word/phrase label <ironic>.",
        "The preceding sentence states what actually hap-pened, and is marked with the label <context>.",
        "The message poster also uses the degree adverb ???",
        "(extremely) and used the exclamation ???",
        "(ba, a sentence-final partical).",
        "These two words are marked with the <rhetoric> label.",
        "The sentiment polarity marks of the ironic word and contextual information, shown as either pos or neg, are also added.",
        "8 Conclusion In this paper, five types of irony patterns are mined, and an irony corpus is constructed based on linguistic forms and sentiment classification.",
        "Four verbal forms in Plurk and Yahoo were further examined.",
        "The former platform restricts short text conversation, and the latter platform allows for the long text description.",
        "The experimental results show that the customary forms tend to be used in informal and conversational texts while the non-customary forms tend to be used in formal articles to convey irony.",
        "The three basic elements that form a successful ironic speech act were also analyzed.",
        "These elements, including the words/phrases with reversed meanings, contextual information and rhetorical words, should be identified first in order to properly process ironic expressions and perform linguistic analysis.",
        "In the mined patterns, it was found that hyperbole was frequently present.",
        "In future work, we will explore other opinion mining and sentiment analysis algorithms, and focus on automatic recognition of hyperbole and the ironic elements.",
