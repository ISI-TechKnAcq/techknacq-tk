        "Recently, deep linguistic analysis has successfully been applied to real-world texts.",
        "Several parsers have been implemented in various grammar formalisms and empirical evaluation has been reported: LFG (Riezler et al., 2002; Cahill et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2004), LTAG (Chiang, 2000), CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003), and HPSG (Miyao et al., 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004).",
        "However, their accuracy was still below the state-of-the-art PCFG parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) in terms of the PARSEVAL score.",
        "Since deep parsers can output deeper representation of the structure of a sentence, such as predicate argument structures, several studies reported the accuracy of predicate-argument relations using a treebank developed for each formalism.",
        "However, resources used for the evaluation were not available for other formalisms, and the results cannot be compared with each other.",
        "In this paper, we employ PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) for the evaluation of the accuracy of HPSG parsing.",
        "In the PropBank, semantic arguments of a predicate and their semantic roles are manually annotated.",
        "Since the PropBank has been developed independently of any grammar formalisms, the results are comparable with other published results using the same test data.",
        "Interestingly, several studies suggested that the identification of PropBank annotations would require linguistically-motivated features that can be obtained by deep linguistic analysis (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Chen and Rambow, 2003).",
        "They employed a CCG (Steedman, 2000) or LTAG (Schabes et al., 1988) parser to acquire syntactic/semantic structures, which would be passed to statistical classifier as features.",
        "That is, they used deep analysis as a preprocessor to obtain useful features for training a probabilistic model or statistical classifier of a semantic argument identifier.",
        "These results imply the superiority of deep linguistic analysis for this task.",
        "Although the statistical approach seems a reasonable way for developing an accurate identifier of PropBank annotations, this study aims at establishing a method of directly comparing the outputs of HPSG parsing with the PropBank annotation in order to explicitly demonstrate the availability of deep parsers.",
        "That is, we do not apply statistical model nor machine learning to the post-processing of the output of HPSG parsing.",
        "By eliminating the effect of post-processing, we can directly evaluate the accuracy of deep linguistic analysis.",

        "(2002) reported the successful application of a hand-crafted LFG (Bresnan, 1982) grammar to the parsing of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) by exploiting various techniques for robust parsing.",
        "The study was impressive because most researchers had believed that deep linguistic analysis of real-world text was impossible.",
        "Their success owed much to a consistent effort to maintain a wide-coverage LFG grammar, as well as var",
        "ious techniques for robust parsing.",
        "However, the manual development of wide-coverage linguistic grammars is still a difficult task.",
        "Recent progress in deep linguistic analysis has mainly depended on the acquisition of lexicalized grammars from annotated corpora (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a; Cahill et al., 2002; Frank et al., 2003; Miyao et al., 2004).",
        "This approach not only allows for the low-cost development of wide-coverage grammars, but also provides the training data for statistical modeling as a by-product.",
        "Thus, we now have a basis for integrating statistical language modeling with deep linguistic analysis.",
        "To date, accurate parsers have been developed for LTAG (Chiang, 2000), CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003), and LFG (Cahill et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2004).",
        "Those studies have opened up the application of deep linguistic analysis to practical use.",
        "However, the accuracy of those parsers was still below PCFG parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) in terms of the PARSEVAL score, i.e., labeled bracketing accuracy of CFG-style parse trees.",
        "Since one advantage of deep parsers is that they can output a sort of semantic representation, e.g. predicate-argument structures, several studies have reported the accuracy of predicate-argument relations (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003; Miyao et al., 2003).",
        "However, their evaluation employed a treebank developed for a specific grammar formalism.",
        "Hence, those results cannot be compared fairly with parsers based on other formalisms including PCFG parsers.",
        "At the same time, following the great success of machine learning approaches in NLP, many research efforts are being devoted to developing various annotated corpora.",
        "Notably, several projects are underway to annotate large corpora with semantic information such as semantic relations of words and coreferences.",
        "PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) are large English corpora annotated with the semantic relations of words in a sentence.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of the annotation of the PropBank.",
        "As the target text of the PropBank is the same as the Penn Treebank, a syntactic structure is given by the Penn Treebank.",
        "The PropBank includes additional annotations representing a predicate and its semantic arguments in a syntactic tree.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, REL denotes a predicate, “choose”, and ARGX represents its semantic arguments: “they” for the 0th argument (i.e., subject) and “this particular moment” for the 1st argument (i.e., object).",
        "Existing studies applied statistical classifiers to the identification of the PropBank or FrameNet annotations.",
        "Similar to many methods of applying machine learning to NLP tasks, they first formulated the task as identifying in a sentence each argument of a given predicate.",
        "Then, parameters of the identifier were learned from the annotated corpus.",
        "Features of a statistical model were defined as a pattern on a partial structure of the syntactic tree output by an automatic parser (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Several studies proposed the use of deep linguistic features, such as predicate-argument relations output by a CCG parser (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and derivation trees output by an LTAG parser (Chen and Rambow, 2003).",
        "Both studies reported that the identification accuracy improved by introducing such deep linguistic features.",
        "Although deep analysis has not outperformed PCFGparsers in terms of the accuracy of surface structure, these results are implicitly supporting the necessity of deep linguistic analysis for the recognition of semantic relations.",
        "However, these results do not directly reflect the performance of deep parsers.",
        "Since these corpora provide deeper structure of a sentence than surface parse trees, they would be suitable for the evaluation of deep parsers.",
