        "This paper presents the Unisys Spoken Language System, as applied to the Air Travel Planning (ATIs) domain.' This domain provides a rich source of interactive dialog, and has been chosen as a common application task for the development and evaluation of spoken language understanding systems.",
        "The Unisys approach to developing a spoken language system combines SUMMIT (the MIT speech recognition system [6]), PUNDIT (the Unisys language understanding system [3]) and an Ingres database of air travel information for eleven cities and nine airports (the ATIS database).",
        "Access to the database is mediated via a general knowledge-base/database interface (the Intelligent Database Server [4]).",
        "To date, we have concentrated on the language understanding and database interface components.",
        "A Dialog Manager integrates the overall user-system interaction.",
        "The Dialog Manager accepts user requests in the form of strings of words and calls PUNDIT to interpret the input; it then calls the database indirectly, via the IDS database interface.",
        "An important function of the Dialog Manager is to maintain a record of the discourse context, so that the system can successfully process connected dialog.",
        "We first describe our architecture in more detail, then give a short discussion of dialog management, a topic we feel will be crucial to successful systems interacting with users via natural language.",
        "We conclude with the presentation and analysis of results from the ATIS common evaluation task and from data gathered at Unisys using our system."

        "The IDI was designed to be compatible with a logic-based knowledge representation scheme and has been used to implement a query server supporting the ATIS database access for PUNDIT.",
        "The query language of the IDI is the Intelligent Database Interface Language (IDIL) and is based on a restricted subset of function-free Horn clauses where the head of a clause represents the target list (i.e., the form of the result relation) and the body is a conjunction of literals which denote database relations or operations on the relations and/or their attributes (e.g., negation, aggregation, and arithmetic operations).",

        "The IDI architecture also contains a cache; the IDI currently caches results of database queries.",
        "Our caching concept also includes the notion of advice provided to the cache.",

        "For ATIS, the DB answers are kept, and mechanisms for referencing data in that form have been added to PUNDIT, to enable it to interpret subsequent inputs in the context of both previous user queries and previous system responses.",
