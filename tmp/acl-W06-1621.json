        "A fundamental task for text understanding applications is to identify semantically equivalent pieces of text.",

        "Summarization systems need to recognize (redundant) semantically matching parts in multiple sentences that are phrased differently.",
        "Other applications, such as information extraction and retrieval, face pretty much the same semantic matching task.",
        "The degree of semantic matching found is typically factored into systems’ scoring and ranking mechanisms.",
        "The recently proposed framework of textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2006) attempts to formulate the generic semantic matching problem in an application independent manner.",
        "The most commonly implemented semantic matching component addresses the lexical level.",
        "At this level the goal is to identify whether the meaning of a lexical item of one text is expressed also within the other text.",
        "Typically, lexical matching models measure the degree of literal lexical overlap, augmented with lexical substitution criteria based on resources such as Wordnet or the output of statistical similarity methods (see Section 2).",
        "Many systems apply semantic matching only at the lexical level, which is used to approximate the overall degree of semantic matching between texts.",
        "Other systems incorporate lexical matching as a component within more complex models that examine matching at higher syntactic and semantic levels.",
        "While lexical matching models are so prominent within semantic systems they are rarely evaluated in a direct manner.",
        "Typically, improvements to a lexical matching model are evaluated by their marginal contribution to overall system performance.",
        "Yet, such global and indirect evaluation does not indicate the absolute performance of the model relative to the sheer lexical matching task for which it was designed.",
        "Furthermore, the indirect application-dependent evaluation mode does not facilitate improving lexical matching models in an application dependent manner, and does not allow proper comparison of such models which were developed (and evaluated) by different researchers within different systems.",
        "This paper proposes a generic definition for the lexical matching task, which we term lexical reference.",
        "This definition is application independent and enables annotating test datasets that evaluate directly lexical matching models.",
        "Consequently, we created a dataset annotated for lexical reference, using a sample of sentence pairs (text-hypothesis) from the 1 st Recognising Textual Entailment dataset.",
        "Further analysis identified sev",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics eral subtypes of lexical reference, pointing at the many interesting cases where lexical reference is derived from a complete context rather than from a particular matching lexical item.",
        "Next, we used the lexical reference dataset to evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art approaches for lexical matching.",
        "Having a direct evaluation task enabled us to capture the actual performance level of these models, to reveal their relative strengths and weaknesses, and even to construct a simple combination of two models that outperforms all the original ones.",
        "Overall, we suggest that it is essential to decompose global semantic matching and textual entailment tasks into proper subtasks, like lexical reference.",
        "Such decomposition is needed in order to fully understand the behavior of individual system components and to guide their future improvements."

      "text": [
        "One of the major observations of the 1st Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-1) challenge referred to the rich structure of entailment modeling systems and the need to evaluate and optimize individual components within them.",
        "When building such a compound system it is valuable to test each component directly during its development, rather than indirectly evaluating the component’s performance via the behavior of the entire system.",
        "If given tools to evaluate each component independently researchers can target and perfect the performance of the subcomponents without the need of building and evaluating the entire end-to-end system.",
        "A common subtask, addressed by practically all participating systems in RTE-1, was to recognize whether each lexical meaning in the hypothesis is referenced by some meaning in the corresponding text.",
        "We suggest that this common goal can be captured through the following definition:",
        "from a set of words in t to a possible meaning of w. Lexical reference may be viewed as a natural extension of textual entailment for sub-sentential hypotheses such as words.",
        "In this work we focus on words meanings, however this work can be directly generalized to word compounds and phrases.",
        "A concrete version of detailed annotation guidelines for lexical reference is presented in the next section.1 Lexical Reference is, in some sense, a more general notion than paraphrases.",
        "If the text includes a paraphrase for w then naturally it does refer to w’s meaning.",
        "However, a text need not include a paraphrase for the concrete meaning of the referenced word w, but only an implied reference.",
        "Accordingly, the referring part might be a large segment of the text, which captures information different than w’s meaning, but still implies a reference to w as part of the text’s meaning.",
        "It is typically a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for textual entailment that the lexical concepts in a hypothesis h are referred in a given text t. For example, in order to infer from a text the hypothesis “a dog bit a man,” it is a necessary that the concepts of dog, bite and man must be referenced by the text, either directly or in an implied manner.",
        "However, for proper entailment it is further needed that the right relations would hold between these concepts 2.",
        "Therefore lexical entailment should typically be a component within a more complex entailment modeling (or semantic matching) system."

      "text": [
        "We created a lexical reference dataset derived from the RTE-1 development set by randomly choosing 400 out of the 567 text-hypothesis examples.",
        "We then created sentence-word examples for all content words in the hypotheses which do not appear in the corresponding sentence and are not a morphological derivation of a word in it (since a simple morphologic module could easily identify these cases).",
        "This resulted in a total of 708 lexical reference examples.",
        "Two annotators annotated these examples as described in the next section.",
        "1 These terms should not be confused with the use of lexical entailment in WordNet, which is used to describe an entailment relationship between verb lexical types, nor with the related notion of reference in classical linguistics, generally describing the relation between nouns or pronouns and objects that are named by them (Frege, 1892) 2or quoting the known journalism saying – “Dog bites man” isn’t news, but “Man bites dog” is.",
        "Taking the same approach as of the RTE-1 dataset creation (Dagan et al., 2006), we limited our experiments to the resulting 580 examples that the two annotators agreed upon3.",
        "3.2.1 Annotation guidelines We asked two annotators to annotate the sentence-word examples according to the following guidelines.",
        "Given a sentence and a target word the annotators were asked to decide whether the target word is referred by the sentence (true) or not (false).",
        "Annotators were guided to mark the pair as true in the following cases: Word: if there is a word in the sentence which, in the context of the sentence, implies a meaning of the target word (e.g. a synonym or hyponym), or which implies a reference to the target word’s meaning (e.g. blind – *see, sight).",
        "See examples 1 2 in Table 1 where the word that implies the reference is emphasized in the text.",
        "Note that in example 2 murder is not a synonym of died nor does it share the same meaning of died; however it is clear from its presence in the sentence that it refers to a death.",
        "Also note that in example 8 although home is a possible synonym for house, in the context of the text it does not appear in that meaning and the example should be annotated as false.",
        "Phrase: if there is a multi-word independent expression in the sentence that implies the target (implication in the same sense that a Word does).",
        "See examples 3-4 in Table 1.",
        "Context: if there is a clear reference to the meaning of the target word by the overall meaning of some part(s) of the sentence (possibly all the sentence), though it is not referenced by any single word or phrase.",
        "The reference is derived from the complete context of the relevant sentence part.",
        "See examples 5-7 in Table 1.",
        "If there is no reference from the sentence to the target word the annotators were instructed to choose false.",
        "In example 9 in Table 1 the target word “HIV-positive” should be considered as one word that cannot be broken down from its unit and although both the general term “HIV status” and the more specific term “HIV negative” are referred to, the target word cannot be understood or derived from the text.",
        "In example 10 although the year 1945 may refer to a specific war, there is no ”war” either specifically or generally understood by the text.",
        "We measured the agreement on the lexical reference binary task (in which Word, Phrase and Context are conflated to true).",
