        "The aim of parsing is to obtain the linguistic interpretation of sentences, that is, their underlying syntactic structure.",
        "This task is one of the fundamental pieces needed by a computer to uns-derstand language as used by humans, and has many applications in Natural Language Processing (Lease et al., 2006).",
        "A wide array of parsing methods exist, including those based on Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs).",
        "(Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2003; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
        "The most impressive results are achieved by subtree reranking systems, as shown in the semi-supervised method of (McClosky et al., 2006), or the forest reranking approximation of (Huang, 2008) in which packed parse forests (compact structures that contain many possible tree derivations) are used.",
        "These state-of-the-art parsers provide trees of excelent quality.",
        "However, perfect results are virtually never achieved.",
        "If the need of one-hundred-percent error free trees arises, the supervision of a user that post-edits and corrects the errors is unavoidable.",
        "Error free trees are needed in many tasks such as handwritten mathematical expressions recognition (Yamamoto et al., 2006), or creation of new gold standard treebanks (Delaclergerie et al., 2008)).",
        "For example, in the creation of the Penn Treebank grammar, a basic two-stage setup was employed: a rudimentary parsing system providad a skeletal syntactic representation, which then was manually corrected by human annotators (Marcus etal., 1993).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new formal framework that tightly integrates the user within the parsing system itself, rather than keeping him isolated from the automatic tools used in a classical two-step approach.",
        "This approach introduces the user into the parsing system, and we will call it \"interactive predictive parsing\", or simply IPP.",
        "An IPP system is interactive because the user is in continuous contact with the parsing process, sending and receiving feedback.",
        "An IPP system is also predictive because it reacts to the user corrections: it predicts and suggest new parse trees taking into account the new gold knowledge received from the user.",
        "Interactive predictive methods have been studied and successfully used in fields like Automatic Text Recognition (Toselli et al., 2008) and Statistical Machine Translation (Barrachina et al., 2009; Vidal et al., 2006) to ease the work of tran-scriptor and translators.",

        "t = argmax pG(t|x) ter where pG(t|x) is the probability of parse tree t given the input string x using model G, and T is the set of all possible parse trees for x.",
        "In an interactive predictive scenario, after obtaining the (probably incorrect) best tree t , the user is able to modify the edges that are incorrect.",
        "The system reacts to each of the corrections introduced by the human by proposing a new t that takes into account the corrected edge.",

        "When the user find an incorrect edge he modifies it, setting the correct label and span.",
        "This action implicitly validates a subtree that is composed by the corrected edge plus all its ancestor edges, which we will call the validated prefix tree tp.",

        "First, the system provides a proposed parse tree (Fig.",
        "1.a).",

        "As the user does this correction, the system automatically validates the correct prefix: all the ancestors of the modified constituent (dashed line in the figure, tp(ciA) from expression (2)).",
