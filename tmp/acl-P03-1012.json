        "Word alignments were first introduced as an intermediate result of statistical machine translation systems (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Since their introduction, many researchers have become interested in word alignments as a knowledge source.",
        "For example, alignments can be used to learn translation lexicons (Melamed, 1996), transfer rules (Car-bonell et al., 2002; Menezes and Richardson, 2001), and classifiers to find safe sentence segmentation points (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "In addition to the IBM models, researchers have proposed a number of alternative alignment methods.",
        "These methods often involve using a statistic such as φ2 (Gale and Church, 1991) or the log likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) to create a score to measure the strength of correlation between source and target words.",
        "Such measures can then be used to guide a constrained search to produce word alignments (Melamed, 2000).",
        "It has been shown that once a baseline alignment has been created, one can improve results by using a refined scoring metric that is based on the alignment.",
        "For example Melamed uses competitive linking along with an explicit noise model in (Melamed, 2000) to produce a new scoring metric, which in turn creates better alignments.",
        "In this paper, we present a simple, flexible, statistical model that is designed to capture the information present in a baseline alignment.",
        "This model allows us to compute the probability of an alignment for a given sentence pair.",
        "It also allows for the easy incorporation of context-specific knowledge into alignment probabilities.",
        "A critical reader may pose the question, “Why invent a new statistical model for this purpose, when existing, proven models are available to train on a given word alignment?” We will demonstrate experimentally that, for the purposes of refinement, our model achieves better results than a comparable existing alternative.",
        "We will first present this model in its most general form.",
        "Next, we describe an alignment algorithm that integrates this model with linguistic constraints in order to produce high quality word alignments.",
        "We will follow with our experimental results and discussion.",
        "We will close with a look at how our work relates to other similar systems and a discussion of possible future directions."

        "We define the null link l(ei, f0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation for any French word in F. The null link l (e0, fj) is defined similarly.",
        "An alignment A for two sentences E and F is a set of links such that every word in E and F participates in at least one link, and a word linked to e0 or f0 participates in no other links.",
        "If e occurs in E x times and f occurs in F y times, we say that e and f co-occur xy times in this sentence pair.",
        "We define the alignment problem as finding the alignment A that maximizes P(A|E, F).",
        "This corresponds to finding the Viterbi alignment in the IBM translation systems.",
        "Those systems model P(F, A|E), which when maximized is equivalent to maximizing P(A|E, F).",
        "We propose here a system which models P(A|E, F) directly, using a different decomposition of terms.",
        "In the IBM models of translation, alignments exist as artifacts of which English words generated which French words.",
        "Our model does not state that one sentence generates the other.",
        "Instead it takes both sentences as given, and uses the sentences to determine an alignment.",
        "An alignment A consists of t links {l1, l2, ... , lt}, where each lk = l(eik, fjk) for some ik and jk.",
        "We will refer to consecutive subsets of A as lji = {li, li+1, ... , lj }.",
        "Given this notation, P(A|E, F) can be decomposed as follows:",
        "At this point, we must factor P(lk I E, F, li−1) to make computation feasible.",
        "Let Ck = {E, F, li−1 } represent the context of lk.",
        "Note that both the context Ck and the link lk imply the occurrence of eik and fjk.",
        "We can rewrite P (lk |Ck) as:",
        "Here P(lk |eik , fjk) is link probability given a co-occurrence of the two words, which is similar in spirit to Melamed’s explicit noise model (Melamed, 2000).",
        "This term depends only on the words involved directly in the link.",
        "The ratio P(a( k 1|l k) ,fjk ) modifies the link probability, providing context-sensitive information.",
        "Up until this point, we have made no simplifying assumptions in our derivation.",
        "Unfortunately, Ck = {E, F, lk−1 1} is too complex to estimate context probabilities directly.",
        "Suppose FTk is a set of context-related features such that P(lk|Ck) can be approximated by P(lk|eik, fjk, FTk).",
        "Let Ck = {eik, fjk}∪FTk.",
        "P(lk|C�k) can then be decomposed using the same derivation as above.",
        "In the second line of this derivation, we can drop eik and fjk from Ck, leaving only FTk, because they are implied by the events which the probabilities are conditionalized on.",
        "Now, we are left with the task of approximating P (FTk |lk) and P(FTk|eik , fjk) .",
        "To do so, we will assume that for all ft ∈ FTk, ft is conditionally independent given either lk or (eik, fjk).",
        "This allows us to approximate alignment probability P(A|E, F) as follows:",
        "In any context, only a few features will be active.",
        "The inner product is understood to be only over those features f t that are present in the current context.",
        "This approximation will cause P(A|E, F) to no longer be a well-behaved probability distribution, though as in Naive Bayes, it can be an excellent estimator for the purpose of ranking alignments.",
        "If we have an aligned training corpus, the probabilities needed for the above equation are quite easy to obtain.",
        "Link probabilities can be determined directly from |lk |(link counts) and |eik , fj,k | (co-occurrence counts).",
        "For any co-occurring pair of words (eik , fjk) , we check whether it has the feature ft.",
        "If it does, we increment the count of = Ift, eik, fjk I.",
        "If this pair is also linked, then we increment the count of If t, lk I.",
        "Note that our definition of FTk allows for features that depend on previous links.",
        "For this reason, when determining whether or not a feature is present in a given context, one must impose an ordering on the links.",
        "This ordering can be arbitrary as long as the same ordering is used in training1 and probability evaluation.",
        "A simple solution would be to order links according their French words.",
        "We choose to order links according to the link probability P(lk Ieik , fjk) as it has an intuitive appeal of allowing more certain links to provide context for others.",
        "We store probabilities in two tables.",
        "The first table stores link probabilities P(lk Ieik, fjk ).",
        "It has an entry for every word pair that was linked at least once in the training corpus.",
