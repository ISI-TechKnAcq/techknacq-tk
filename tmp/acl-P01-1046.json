        "On the other hand, powerful car is highly plausible, whereas strong car is less plausible.",
        "It has been argued in the theoretical literature that the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair is largely a collocational (i.e., idiosyncratic) property, in contrast to verb-object or noun-noun plausibility, which is more predictable (Cruse, 1986; Smadja, 1991).",
        "The collocational hypothesis has recently been investigated in a corpus study by Lapata et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "This study investigated potential statistical predictors of adjective-noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus-derived measures: co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun frequency, conditional probability of the noun given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure.",
        "All predictors but one were positively correlated with plausibility; the highest correlation was obtained with co-occurrence frequency.",
        "Resnik’s selectional association measure surprisingly yielded a significant negative correlation with judged plausibility.",
        "These results suggest that the best predictor of whether an adjective-noun combination is plausible or not is simply how often the adjective and the noun collocate in a record of language experience.",
        "As a predictor of plausibility, co-occurrence frequency has the obvious limitation that it cannot be applied to adjective-noun pairs that never occur in the corpus.",
        "A zero co-occurrence count might be due to insufficient evidence or might reflect the fact that the adjective-noun pair is inherently implausible.",
        "In the present paper, we address this problem by using smoothing techniques (distance-weighted averaging and class-based smoothing) to recreate missing co-occurrence counts, which we then compare to plausibility judgements elicited from human subjects.",
        "By demonstrating a correlation between recreated frequencies and plausibility judgements, we show that these smoothing methods produce realistic frequency estimates for missing co-occurrence data.",

        "The smoothing methods proposed in the literature (overviews are provided by Dagan et al.",
        "(1999) and Lee (1999)) can be generally divided into three types: discounting (Katz, 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993), and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "Discounting methods decrease the probability of previously seen events so that the total probability of observed word co-occurrences is less than one, leaving some probability mass to be redistributed among unseen co-occurrences.",
        "Class-based smoothing and distance-weighted averaging both rely on an intuitively simple idea: inter-word dependencies are modelled by relying on the corpus evidence available for words that are similar to the words of interest.",
        "The two approaches differ in the way they measure word similarity.",
        "Distance-weighted averaging estimates word similarity from lexical co-occurrence information, viz., it finds similar words by taking into account the linguistic contexts in which they occur: two words are similar if they occur in similar contexts.",
        "In class-based smoothing, classes are used as the basis according to which the co-occurrence probability of unseen word combinations is estimated.",
        "Classes can be induced directly from the corpus (Pereira et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1992) or taken from a manually crafted taxonomy (Resnik, 1993).",
        "In the latter case the taxonomy is used to provide a mapping from words to conceptual classes.",
        "In language modelling, smoothing techniques are typically evaluated by showing that a language model which uses smoothed estimates incurs a reduction in perplexity on test data over a model that does not employ smoothed estimates (Katz, 1987).",

        "In our experiments we recreated co-occurrence frequencies for unseen adjective-noun pairs using two different approaches: taxonomic class-based smoothing and distance-weighted averaging.",
        "1 We evaluated the recreated frequencies by comparing them with plausibility judgements elicited from human subjects.",
        "In contrast to previous work, this type of evaluation does not presuppose that the recreated frequencies are needed for a specific natural language processing task.",

        "Selectional association is defined as the amount of information a given predicate carries about its argument, where the argument is represented by its corresponding classes in a taxonomy such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "This means that predicates which impose few restrictions on their arguments have low selectional association values, whereas predicates selecting for a restricted number of arguments have high selectional association values.",
        "Consider the verbs see and polymerise: intuitively there is a great variety of things which can be seen, whereas there is a very specific set of things which can be polymerised (e.g., ethylene).",
        "Resnik demonstrated that his measure of selectional association successfully captures this intuition: selectional association values are correlated with verb-argument plausibility as judged by native speakers.",
        "However, Lapata et al.",
        "(1999) found that the success of selectional association as a predictor of plausibility does not seem to carry over to adjective-noun plausibility.",
        "There are two potential reasons for this: (1) the semantic restrictions that adjectives impose on the nouns with which they combine appear to be less strict than the ones imposed by verbs (consider the adjective superb which can combine with nearly any noun); and (2) given their lexicalist nature, adjective-noun combinations may defy selectional restrictions yet be intuitively plausible (consider the pair sad day, where sadness is not an attribute of day).",
        "To address these problems, we replaced Resnik’s information-theoretic measure with a simpler measure which makes no assumptions with respect to the contribution of a semantic class to the total quantity of information provided by the predicate about the semantic classes of its argument.",
        "We simply substitute the noun occurring in the adjective-noun combination with the concept by which it is represented in the taxonomy and estimate the adjective-noun co-occurrence frequency by counting the number of times the concept corresponding to the noun is observed to co-occur with the adjective in the corpus.",
        "Because a given word is not always represented by a single class in the taxonomy (i.e., the",
        "noun co-occurring with an adjective can generally be the realisation of one of several conceptual classes), we constructed the frequency counts for an adjective-noun pair for each conceptual class by dividing the contribution from the adjective by the number of classes to which it belongs (Lauer, 1995; Resnik, 1993): where f(a, n') is the number of times the adjective a was observed in the corpus with concept c E classes (n�) and I classes (n')I is the number of conceptual classes noun n' belongs to.",
        "Note that the estimation of the frequency f(a, c) relies on the simplifying assumption that the noun co-occurring with the adjective is distributed evenly across its conceptual classes.",
        "This simplification is necessary unless we have a corpus of adjective-noun pairs labelled explicitly with taxonomic information.2 Consider the pair proud chief which is not attested in the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995).",
        "The word chief has two senses in WordNet and belongs to seven conceptual classes ((causal agent), (entity), (leader), (life form), (person), (superior), and (supervisor)) This means that the co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair will be constructed for each of the seven classes, as shown in Table 1.",
        "Suppose for example that we see the pair proud leader in the corpus.",

        "As an example refer to Table 6, which displays the ten most distributionally similar words to the adjectives guilty and dangerous and to the nouns stop and giant discovered by the Jensen-Shannon measure.",
        "The set of similar words is far from semantically coherent.",
        "As far as the adjective guilty is concerned the measure discovered antonyms such as innocent and honest.",
        "Semantically unrelated adjectives such as injured, democratic, or interested are included; it seems that their syntactic behaviour is similar to that of guilty, e.g., they all co-occur with party.",
        "The same pattern can be observed for the adjective dangerous, to which none of the discovered adjectives are intuitively semantically related, perhaps with the exception of bad.",
        "The set of words most similar to the noun stop also does not appear to be semantically coherent.",
        "This problem with distance-weighted averaging is aggravated by the fact that the adjective or noun that we smooth over can be polysemous.",
        "Take the set of similar words for giant, for instance.",
        "The words company, manufacturer, industry and firm are similar to the ‘enterprise’ sense of giant, whereas artist, star, master are similar to the ‘important/influential person’ sense of giant.",
        "However, no similar word was found for either the ‘beast’ or ‘heavyweight person’ sense of giant.",
        "This illustrates that the distance-weighted averaging approach fails to take proper account of the polysemy of a word.",
        "The class-based approach, on the other hand, relies on WordNet, a lexical taxonomy that can be expected to cover most senses of a given lexical item.",
        "Recall that distance-weighted averaging discovers distributionally similar words by looking at simple lexical co-occurrence information.",
        "In the case of adjective-noun pairs we concentrated on combinations found in the corpus in a head-modifier relationship.",
        "This limited form of surface-syntactic information does not seem to be sufficient to reproduce the detailed knowledge that people have about the semantic relationships between words.",
        "Our class-based smoothing method, on the other hand, relies on the semantic taxonomy of WordNet, where fine-grained conceptual knowledge about words and their relations is encoded.",
        "This knowledge can be used to create semantically coherent equivalence classes.",
        "Such classes will not contain antonyms or items whose behaviour is syntactically related, but not semantically similar, to the words of interest.",
        "To summarise, it appears that distance-weighted averaging smoothing is only partially successful in reproducing the linguistic dependencies that characterise and constrain the formation of adjective-noun combinations.",
        "The class-based smoothing method, however, relies on a predefined taxonomy that allows these dependencies to be inferred, and thus reliably estimates the plausibility of adjective-noun combinations that fail to co-occur in the corpus."

        "This paper investigated the validity of smoothing techniques by using them to recreate the frequencies of adjective-noun pairs that fail to occur in a 100 million word corpus.",
        "We showed that the recreated frequencies are significantly correlated with plausibility judgements.",
        "These results were then extended by applying the same smoothing techniques to adjective-noun pairs that occur in the corpus.",
        "These recreated frequencies were significantly correlated with the actual frequencies, as well as with plausibility judgements.",
        "Our results provide independent evidence for the validity of the smoothing techniques we employed.",
        "In contrast to previous work, our evaluation does not presuppose that the recreated frequencies are used in a specific natural language processing task.",
        "Rather, we established an independent criterion for the validity of smoothing techniques by comparing them to plausibility judgements, which are known to correlate with co-occurrence frequency.",
        "We also carried out a comparison of different smoothing methods, and found that class-based smoothing outperforms distance-weighted averaging.4 From a practical point of view, our findings provide a very simple account of adjective-noun plausibility.",
        "Extending the results of Lapata et al.",
        "(1999), we confirmed that co-occurrence frequency can be used to estimate the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair.",
        "If no co-occurrence counts are available from the corpus, then counts can be recreated using the corpus and a structured source of taxonomic knowledge (for the class-based approach).",
        "Distance-weighted averaging can be seen as a ‘cheap’ way to obtain this sort of taxonomic knowledge.",
        "However, this method does not draw upon semantic information only, but is also sensitive to the syntactic distribution of the target word.",
        "This explains the fact that distance-weighted averaging yielded a lower correlation with perceived plausibility than class-based smoothing.",
        "A taxonomy like WordNet provides a cleaner source of conceptual information, which captures essential aspects of the type of knowledge needed for assessing the plausibility of an adjective-noun combination."
