        "in the media The issue of framing (Goffman, 1974; Scheufele, 1999; Benford and Snow, 2000) is of great importance in understanding how public opinion is formed.",
        "In their Annual Review of Political Science survey, Chong and Druckman (2007) describe framing effects as occurring ?when (often small) changes in the presentation of an issue or an event produce (sometimes large) changes of opinion?",
        "(p. 104); as an example, they cite a study wherein respondents answered differently, when asked whether a hate group should be allowed to hold a rally, depending on whether the question was phrased as one of ?free speech?",
        "or one of ?risk of violence?.",
        "The genesis of our work is in a framing question motivated by a relatively current political issue.",
        "In media coverage of transgenic crops and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food, do pro-GMO vs. anti-GMO articles differ not just with respect to word choice, but in adopting a more ?scientific?",
        "discourse, meaning the inclusion of more uncertainty and fewer emotionally-laden words?",
        "We view this as an interesting question from a text analysis perspective (with potential applications and implications that lie outside the scope of this article).",
        "1.2 Hedging as a sign of scientific discourse To obtain a computationally manageable characterization of ?scientific discourse?, we turned to studies of the culture and language of science, a body of work spanning fields ranging from sociology to applied linguistics to rhetoric and communication (Gilbert and Mulkay, 1984; Latour, 1987; Latour and Woolgar, 1979; Halliday and Martin, 1993; Baz-erman, 1988; Fahnestock, 2004; Gross, 1990).",
        "One characteristic that has drawn quite a bit of attention in such studies is hedging (Myers, 1989;",
        "Hyland, 1998; Lewin, 1998; Salager-Meyer, 2011).1 Hyland (1998, pg.",
        "1) defines hedging as the expression of ?tentativeness and possibility?",
        "in communication, or, to put it another way, language corresponding to ?the writer withholding full commitment to statements?",
        "(pg.",
        "3).",

        "Hyland (1998, p. 6) writes, ?Despite a widely held belief that professional scientific writing is a series of impersonal statements of fact which add up to the truth, hedges are abundant in science and play a critical role in academic writing?.",
        "Indeed, Myers (1989, p. 13) claims that in scientific research articles, ?The hedging of claims is so common that a sentence that looks like a claim but has no hedging is probably not a statement of new knowledge?.3 Not only is understanding hedges important to understanding the rhetoric and sociology of science, but hedge detection and analysis ?",
        "in the sense of identifying uncertain or uncertainly-sourced information (Farkas et al., 2010) ?",
        "has important applications to information extraction, broadly construed, and has thus become an active sub-area of natural-language processing.",

        "Shared Task was devoted to this problem (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "Putting these two lines of research together, we see before us what appears to be an interesting interdisciplinary and, at least in principle, straightforward research program: relying on the aforementioned rhetoric analyses to presume that hedging is a key characteristic of scientific discourse, build a hedge-detection system to computationally ascertain which proponents in the GMO debate tend to use more hedges and thus, by presumption, tend to adopt a more ?scientific?",

        "Our technical goal here, at this workshop, where hedge detection is one of the most relevant topics to the broad questions we have raised, is not to learn to classify texts as being pro-vs. anti-GMO, or as being scientific or not, per se.5 Our focus is on whether hedging specifically, considered as a single feature, is correlated with these different document classes, because of the previous research attention that has been devoted to hedging in particular and because of hedging being one of the topics of this workshop.",

        "We would welcome hearing the results of other people's efforts.",
        "2 How should we test whether hedging distinguishes scientific text?",
        "One very important point that we have not yet addressed is: While the literature agrees on the importance of hedging in scientific text, the relative degree of hedging in scientific vs. non-scientific text is a matter of debate.",
        "On the one side, we have assertions like those of Fahnestock (1986), who shows in a clever, albeit small-scale, study involving parallel texts that when scientific observations pass into popular accounts, changes include ?removing hedges ... thus conferring greater certainty on the reported facts?",
        "(pg.",
        "275).",
        "Similarly, Juanillo, Jr. (2001) refers to a shift from a forensic style to a ?celebratory?",
        "style when scientific research becomes publicized, and credits Brown (1998) with noting that ?celebratory scientific discourses tend to pay less attention to caveats, contradictory evidence, and qualifications that are highlighted in forensic or empiricist discourses.",
        "By downplaying scientific uncertainty, it [sic] alludes to greater certainty of scientific results for public consumption?",
        "(Juanillo, Jr., 2001, p. 42).",
        "However, others have contested claims that the popularization process involves simplification, distortion, hype, and dumbing down, as Myers (2003) colorfully puts it; he provides a critique of the relevant literature.",
        "Varttala (1999) ran a corpus analysis in which hedging was found not just in professional medical articles, but was also ?typical of popular scientific articles dealing with similar topics?",

        "Moreover, significant variation in use of hedging has been found across disciplines and authors?",
        "native language; see Salager-Meyer (2011) or Varttala (2001) for a review.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies validating the hypothesis that hedges appear more or less frequently in scientific discourse.",
        "Proposed procedure Given the above, our first step must be to determine whether hedges are more or less prominent in ?professional scientific?",

        "(henceforth ?pop-science?)",
        "discussions of GMOs.",

        "First, we can see that the performance degraded significantly compared to the performance for in-domain cross validation.",
        "Second, of the three different models, Bio showed the best performance.",
        "Bio+Wiki gave the worst performance, which hints that combining two datasets and cue words may not be a promising strategy: although Bio+Wiki shows very good recall, this can be attributed to its larger feature set, which contains all available cues and perhaps as a result has a very high false-positive rate.",
        "We further investigated and compared performance on LEXIS and WOS for the best model (Bio).",
        "Not surprisingly, our classifier works better in WOS than in LEXIS.",
        "It is clear that there exist domain differences between the CoNLL dataset and WOS+LEXIS.",
        "To better understand the poor cross-domain performance of the classifier, we tuned another model based on the performance on the 153 labeled sentences using Bio as training data.",
        "As we can see in Table 6, the performance on WOS improved significantly, while the performance on LEXIS decreased.",
        "This is probably caused by the fact that WOS is a collection of scientific paper abstracts, which is more similar to the training corpus than LEXIS, which is a collection of news media articles15.",
        "Also, LEXIS articles are hard to classify even with the tuned model, which challenges the effectiveness of a cue-words frequency approach beyond professional scientific texts.",
        "Indeed, the simplicity of our reimplementation of Georgescul's algorithm seems to cause longer sentences to be classified as uncertain, because cue phrases (or n-grams extracted from 15The Wiki model performed better on LEXIS than on WOS.",
        "Though the performance was not good, this result further reinforces the possibility of a domain-dependence problem.",

        "of uncertain sentences in WOS and LEXIS according to our trained classifiers, although we regard these results as unreliable since those classifiers have low accuracy.",
        "Bio refers to the best model trained on Bio only in Section 5.1, while Tuned refers to the model in Table 6 that is tuned based on the 153 labeled sentences in WOS+LEXIS.",
        "While the cross-domain results were not reliable, we produced preliminary results on whether there exist fewer hedges in scientific text.",
        "We can see that the relative difference in certain/uncertain ratios predicted by the two different models (Bio, Tuned) are different in Table 7.",
        "In the tuned model, the difference between LEXIS and WOS in terms of the percentage of uncertain sentences was not statistically significant, while in the Bio model, their difference was statistically significant.",
        "Since the performance of our hedge classifier on the 153 hand-annotated WOS+LEXIS sentences was not reliable, though, we must abstain from making conclusive statements here."

        "To develop a hedge classifier, we took advantage of the CoNLL dataset and a small annotated WOS and LEXIS dataset.",
        "Our preliminary results show there may exist a gap which indicates that hedging may, in fact, distinguish prof-science and pop-science documents.",
        "In fact, this computational analysis suggests the possibility that hedges occur less frequently in scientific prose, which contradicts several prior assertions in the literature.",
        "To confirm the argument that pop-science tends to use more hedging than prof-science, we need a hedge classifier that performs more reliably in the WOS and LEXIS dataset than ours does.",
        "An interesting research direction would be to develop transfer-learning techniques to generalize hedge classifiers for different datasets, or to develop a general hedge classifier relatively robust to domain differences.",
        "In either case, more annotated data on WOS and LEXIS is needed for better evaluation or training.",
        "Another strategy would be to bypass the first step, in which we determine whether hedges are more or less prominent in scientific discourse, and proceed directly to labeling and hedge-detection in pro-GMO and anti-GMO texts.",
        "However, this will not answer the question of whether advocates in debates other than on GMO-related topics employ a more scientific discourse.",
        "Nonetheless, to aid those who wish to pursue this alternate strategy, we have collected two sets of opinionated articles on GMO (pro-and anti-); see appendix for more details."
