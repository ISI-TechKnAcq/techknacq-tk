        "It is not realistic to expect that exclusively using tree-distance measures in this rather pure way will give state-of-the-art question-answering performance, but the contribution of this paper is the (start of an) exporation of the syntactic parameters which effect the use of tree-distance in question answering.",
        "More work needs to be done in systematically varying the parsers, question-answering tasks, and parametrisations of tree-distance over all the possibilities.",
        "There are many possibilities to be explored involving adapting cost functions to enriched node descriptions.",
        "Already mentioned above, is the possibility to involve semantic information in the cost functions.",

        "Interestingly Punyakonok(2004) themselves speculate: each node in a tree represents only a word in the sentence; we believe that appropriately combining nodes into meaningful phrases may allow our approach to perform better.",
        "We found working with constituency trees that it was the sub-traversal distance measure that performed best, and it needs to be seen whether this holds also for dependency trees.",
        "Also to be explored is the role of structural weighting in a system using dependency trees.",
        "A final speculation that it would be interesting to explore is whether one can use feedback from performance on a QATD task as a driver in the machine-learning of probabilities for a parser, in an approach analogous to the use of the language-model in parser training."

        "This appendix briefly summarises the algorithm to compute the tree-distance, based on (Zhang and Shasha, 1989) (see Section 2.1 for definition of tree-distance).",
        "The algorithm operates on the left-to-right post-order traversals of trees.",
        "Given source and target trees S and T, the output is a table T, indexed vertically by the traversal of S and horizontally by the traversal of T, and position T[i] [j] is the tree-distance from the S subtree rooted at i, to the T subtree rooted at j.",
        "Thus the bottom righthand corner of the table represents the tree distance between S and T. If k is the index of a node of the tree, the leftmost leaf, l(k), is the index of the leaf reached by following the left-branch down.",
        "For a given leaf there is a highest node of which it is the leftmost leaf.",
        "Let such a node be called a key-root.",
        "Let KR(T) be the sequence of key-roots in T. The algorithm is a doubly nested loop ascending throught the key-roots of S and T, in which for each pair of key-roots (i, j), a routine tree dist(i, j) updates the T table.",
        "Suppose i is any node of S. Then for any is with l (i) ≤ is ≤ i, the subsequence of S from l(i) to is can be seen as a forest of subtrees of S, denoted F(l(i),is).",
        "tree dist(i, j) creates a table F, indexed vertically from l (i) to i and horizontally from l(j) to j, such that F[is][jt] represents the distance between the forests F(l(i), is) and F (l (j ), jt) .",
        "Also the F table should be seen as having an extra leftmost column, representing for each is, l(i) ≤ is ≤ i, the F(l(i), is) to ∅ mapping (pure deletion), and an extra uppermost row representing for each for each jt, l(j) ≤ jt ≤ j, the ∅ to F (l (j), jt) mapping (pure insertion).",
        "F[i3] [jt] = min of delete, insert, for + tree, where swap, delete, insert as before and",
        "In case 1, the ‘forests’ F(l(i), is) and F (l (j), jt) are both single trees and the computed forest distance is transferred to the tree-distance table T. In case 2, at least one of F(l(i), is) or F (l (j ), jt) represents a forest of more than one tree.",
        "This means there is the possibility that the final trees in the two forests are mapped to each other.",
        "This quantity is found from the T table.",
        "This formulation gives the whole-tree distance between S and T. For the sub-tree distance, you take the minimum of the final column of T. For the sub-traversal case, you do the same but on the final iteration, you set the pure deletion column of F to all 0s, and take the minimum of the final column ofF.",
        "To accommodate wild-card target trees, case 1 in the above is extended to allow T[is][jt] = F[is][jt] = 0 in case jt is the root of a wild-card tree.",
        "To accommodate self-effacing source trees, case 2 in the above is extended to also consider for + tree del = F[l(is) − 1, jt]."
