        "L REL English in Terms of Modern Linguistics REL, a Rapidly Extensible Language System, is an integrated information system operating in conversational interaction with the computer.",
        "It is intended for work with large or small data bases by means of highly individualized languages.",
        "The architecture of REL is based on theoretical assumptions about human information dynamics [1], among them the expanding process of conceptualization in working with data, and the idiosyncratic language use of the individual workers.",
        "The result of these assumptions is a system which allows the construction of highly individualized languages which are closely knit with the structure of the data and which can be rapidly extended and augmented with new concepts and structures through a facile definitional capability.",
        "The REL language processor is designed to accommodate a variety of languages whose structural characteristics may be considerably divergent.",
        "The REL English is one of the languages within the REL system.",
        "It is intended to facilitate sophisticated work with computers without the need-for mastering programming languages.",
        "The structural power of REL English matches the extremely flexible organization of data in ring forms.",
        "Extensions of the basic REL English language can be achieved either through",
        "defining new concepts and structures in terms of the existing ones or through addition of new rules.",
        "The REL dialect and idiolects English is our primary mode of verbal communication, therefore everyone has the right to know what someone else means by it.",
        "We use the term \"English\" in its most ordinary sense, i. e. we bear in mind the fact that there really is no one English language.",
        "Rather, the term English refers to as many idiolects as there are speakers, these idiolects being grouped into dialects.",
        "The REL English is one such dialect.",
        "It shares with natural language also the characteristic of being, in its design and functioning, a conglomerate of idiolects, which we call versions.",
        "Thompson's design philosophy of REL [2] defines the theoretical basis for the assumption of individual, idiolectal approach to the use of information.",
        "REL English as a formal language The second basic characteristic is that REL English is a formal language.",
        "The characteristics of English as a formal language are discussed in an earlier paper [3].",
        "The central thesis of that paper is that English becomes a formal language when the subject matter which it talks about is limited to material whose interrelationships, are specifiable in a limited number of precisely structured categories.",
        "It is the type of",
        "structuration of the subject matter and not the nature of the subject matter itself that produces the necessary limitations.",
        "Natural language encompasses a multitude of formal languages and it is the complexities of the memory structures on which natural language can and does operate that account for the complexities, flexibility and richness of natural language.",
        "These latter give rise to the notorious problem of ambiguities in natural language analysis.",
        "Ambiguities What about ambiguities in REL English?",
        "The purpose of REL English grammar is to provide a language facilitating work with computers.",
        "It is thus assumed that the language is used for a specific purpose in a specific context.",
        "Allowance for ambiguities at the phrase level, with subsequent disambiguition through context, is a powerful mechanism in a language.",
        "It is this aspect of ambiguity we wish to include.",
        "Ambiguities, in the general case and in our case, are due to different semantic interpretations (data structuration) arising from different deep structures.",
        "Ambiguous constructions are of two main types: (1) those which are structurally ambiguous, e.g., 'Boston ships\" is ambiguous over all relations existing between \"Boston\" and \"ships\" (built in Bostai, with home port in Boston, etc.",
        "); and (2) those which are semantically ambiguous, e. g. , \"location of King\" if \"King\" can refer both to Captain King and the",
        "destroyer King in the data elements.",
        "Ambiguities of the first type can be resolved by the specification of the relation, those of the second type by inclusion of larger context.",
        "Chomsky's well-known example of an ambiguous sentence \"Flying planes can be dangerous\" is of the first type; Katz and Fodor's \"bachelor\" is of the second type.",
        "The purpose of REL sentence analysis is not to find all possible interpretations of ambiguous sentences irrespective of context.",
        "Rather, the purpose is maximal disambiguation where such disambiguation is possible in terms of semantic interpretation, providing for the preservation of ambiguities present in memory structures if the syntactic form of the query is ambiguous.",
        "Nature of restrictions How does our English compare with English as discussed by modern linguists?",
        "On the level of surface structure, they are essentially the same.",
        "Some more complex transformationally derived strings, such as certain forms of elipsis are not handled as yet.",
        "However, most of the common forms are treated in a straightforward manner.",
        "Although some constructions which can be formed in natural conversational English are not provided in the basic English package, such deficiencies can to a large extent be overcome by the capability for definitional extension provided by the system.",
        "The level of deep structure presents more problems.",
        "As 4 distinct from surface structure, deep structure is that level of syntactic analysis which constitutes the input to semantic analysis, both in Chomsky's [4] terms and ours.",
        "What is the nature of this semantic interpretation?",
        "In the general case, little is known.",
        "In our case, as in most types of computer analysis, interpretation is in terms of the internal forms of organization of the data in memory.",
        "To the extent that the constituents of deep structure can be directly correlated with corresponding structures in the data, semantic analysis, and therefore sentence analysis, can be carried to completion.",
        "It is important to distinguish, in this regard, between two quite distinct though related ways in which language use can be restricted.",
        "The first is by the ways in which the data is organized, that is the structural forms used and the interlinkages which are formed for the manipulation of these structures.",
        "This type we will call \"structural\" restrictions.",
        "The second is by restrictions of the subject matter, or the universe of discourse; this we will call \"discourse\" restrictions.",
        "When one restricts the universe of discourse to a body of material which is naturally formal or has been formalized, one often tacitly accepts the structural restrictions thus imposed.",
        "To the uninitiated, it may appear that it is the discouse limitations and not the implied structural limitations that make the material amenable to machine analysis.",
        "However, it is the estab5 lishment of relatability between deep structural constituents and data structural forms, rather than discourse restrictions that make computer processing of the semantic component possible.",
        "Any content area whose data is organized into these given structural forms can be equally efficiently processed by a system establishing such interrelationships.",
        "The restrictions on REL English are a function of the first type of restrictions, i. e., structural restrictions.",
        "Not all deep structures found in natural English are brought out by our analysis, because constituents of these deep structures do not correspond to structural relations in the organization of our data.",
        "For instance, \"collections of boys\" and \"boys' collections\" are considered synonymous, although they are not in English.",
        "Consider: \"At the fair, I saw collections of boys.",
        "\" and \"At the fair, I saw boys' collections.\" Finally, a limitation in reverse, as it were, is the fact that we have emphasized the inclusion of grammatical strings rather than attending to strict insistence on grammaticality.",
        "Organization of the REL English grammar* The REL English grammar consists of a syntactic component and a semantic component.",
        "The syntactic component consists of a We are indebted to Norton Greenfeld for many valuable insights and comments as well as for the excellent programming of a large portion of the current English rules.",
        "set of rewrite rules, context-free and general, which build the deep structure Phrase-markers in the form of kernel sentences, and a number of transformational rules.",
        "The semantic component consists of semantic transformation rules acting on the memory structures of the data bases.",
        "The language processor, described in detail in the accompanying paper [5], builds a sentence analysis Phrase-marker.",
        "The sentence is interpreted by successive application of the corresponding semantic transformations in accordance with the parsing.",
        "The application of semantic rules to the constituents of a complex phrase produces the interpretation of the phrase or, if the phrase is semantically meaningless, an indication of that to the language processor.",
        "The parts of speech of REL English are given in Figure 1, together with examples.",
        "These parts of speech are inclusive terms for syntactic classes (labels on the parsing tree), and semantic categories (memory structures).",
        "Function words, e. g. , all, of, what, are distinct from referent words; the former are empty in the sense of not being associated with memory structures.",
        "Other aspects of the grammar, namely features, name and relation modification, verbs, clauses, quantifiers and conjunctions, are discussed in detail in the remainder of the paper."

        "Structural Power of Language and Structural Power of Data Organization The case of English as a programming language against other programming languages needs a defense.",
        "There are obvious justifications.",
        "For a user for whom the computer is only a tool facilitating interaction with his data, English, being his natural mode of language communication, is a medium allowing maximum concentration on the problem itself by minimizing the need for concern with the medium.",
        "The flexibility of natural-like language augmented by the extensibility of such a language provides a means for facile manipulation of existing data structures and for new concept formation.",
        "We believe that a deeper justification lies in the relationship between language structure and data structuration.",
        "There must exist a correspondence between the power of language and the power of data organization.",
        "Given the following extreme alternatives:",
        "rich language for work with highly formatted data introduces too many alternatives and ambiguities which may actually lower efficiency.",
        "Conversely, the use of a formatted language for work with powerfully structured data precludes full and efficient exploitation of the organization of the data by imposing a restricted medium of access.",
        "Ring Structure of REL English Data Bases Since effective communication requires the maximization of information, the structuration of the process must be a compromise between the communicating entities -- in our case, the human user and the computer.",
        "Ring structures are a very flexible medium, suitable for the organization of data on which natural language operates and formalized enough to be amenable to manipulation by computer programs.",
        "[6] The semantic component of REL English, mentioned above, consists of the interpretation part of the rules of grammar.",
        "These interpretation rules constitute checks on the ring structures.",
        "Let us take as our data base the following environment:",
        "1) There are three ships: Maru, Pinta and Nina.",
        "2) The-respective locations of these ships are: Boston, Boston and New York.",

        "The arrow at intersection points on the SHIP ring pointing down and on the Maru, Pinta and Nina pointing up indicate the class-member relationship: Pinta is a member of the class SHIP.",
        "This exemplifies ring structures which relate classes of objects and individual objects.",
        "The other type of ring structure are binary relations between rings.",
        "If we follow now the link from the Pinta ring through the location ring, we reach the Boston ring.",
        "The relation of location holds between Pinta and Boston, thus, in predicate notation, we can say: location (Pinta, Boston).",
        "The symbols 0, 1 and 2 refer to the order in this relationship.",
        "Number relations, such as population, relate a ring to a number: population (Boston, 3205).",
        "They exist as links within the respective rings to which they refer.",
        "However, the numerical data itself is in the ring to which it applies.",
        "Thus one finds a referent to population on the Boston ring; and associated with the referent to population is the data entry.",
        "The structural methods used to handle the time aspects of time-related data are not discussed in this paper for reasons of space.",
        "Ring structures are also built during analysis of sentences and undone on their completion.",
        "Thus in the processing of the sentence:",
        "What are the locations of ships?",
        "the semantic transformation associated with the 'N R of N' rule will build a scratch ring of all locations of ships, in the particular case at hand, Boston and New York.",
        "This scratch ring will be interrelated to the data base in the same manner as permanent rings and thus will participate in further analysis in a straightforward way.",
        "Upon completion of the analysis and response to the given sentence, the links to this scratch ring and the scratch ring itself will be deleted from other rings of the data base.",
        "A second type of scratch ring is a number ring, that is a ring all of whose entries are numerical data.",
        "For example, the phrase: 'populations of cities' will result in the creation of such a number ring containing the numbers 3205, 11366, 6689.",
        "The syntactic result of 'population of cities' has part of speech U, and the number ring feature (discussed below) designates the character of the underlying structure.",
        "Rules such as 'U average U', or 'U a sum of U' apply to number rings.",
        "New data can be entered simply from the console, for example that the Santa Maria is a ship located in Boston: def: Santa Maria: = name The Santa Maria is a ship!",
        "The location of the Santa Maria is Boston!",
        "This will result in the creation of a ring for Santa Maria and a",

        "Some aspects of the operation of features from the point of view of the language processor are discussed in [5].",

        "Since 1948 is within the time interval '0 to 1950', the answer will be affirmative If the input is a negative question, we use the time for which the relation does not hold.",

        "These are supplied by the clause processing routine as either subjects or objects.",

        "The output of rule (iii) is a time (or time list) at which the relation indicated in the verb table holds.",
        "The output may be ambiguous.",
