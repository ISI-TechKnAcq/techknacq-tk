        "Although the methods above can improve the translation performance for OOV term to a certain degree, there are still three common problems in the OOV term translation based on Web mining.",
        "(1) Chinese key term extraction pattern from Web documents is over complex and the complexity is always higher.",
        "Because of the inherent property of having no segmentation delimitation in Chinese, it's very difficult for English-Chinese OOV term translation to extract Chinese key terms from Web documents.",

        "The branch node stands for the comparison bit (Comp-bit), which represents the position of different bit in binary strings.",
        "Some binary strings have the value of 0 in such a bit and are classified into the left branch, while others have 1 and turn to the right branch.",
        "In the extraction process, the PAT-tree is traversed first, and the branch nodes with the Comp-bit values larger than 32 are selected.",
        "This is because the minimum length of a Chinese common string is 2 characters and each has 16 binary bits.",
        "Next, the frequency values of both two child nodes are added as the frequency of the common string (i.e., the parent branch node).",
        "At last, the common strings with the frequency values larger than 2 are extracted as the key terms.",

        "7.6 Analysis and Discussion Through analyzing the results for translation extraction and ranking, it can be found that the translation quality is highly related to the following aspects.",
        "(1) The translation results are associated with the search engine used, especially for some specific OOV terms.",
        "For example, given an OOV term \"Cross-Strait Three-links\", the mining result based on Google in China is \"Sj^^-H-Ãœ\", while some meaningless information is mined by Live Trans.",
        "(2) Some terms are conventional terminologies and cannot be translated literally.",
        "For example, \"Woman Pace-Setter\", a proper noun with the Chinese characteristic, should be translated into \"-=-/VÂ£L^-f-\", rather than 'St ^fiftiH^\" (women's pace) or \"ijs'J/t\" (establishment) given by Google Translate.",
        "(3) The proposed model is sensitive to the notability degree of OOV term.",
        "This phenomenon is the main reason why there is obvious difference among the translation performance for PRN, LCN and OGN.",
        "(4) There is a \"fragment effect\" in PAT-Tree-based Chinese key term extraction.",
        "The fragments of Chinese terms have become the main noisy data.",
        "Such a problem should be solved by setting the specific threshold for additional features like heuristic rules and occurrence distance.",
        "(5) Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) should be added to improve the translation performance.",
        "Although most of OOV terms have a unique semantic definition, there are still a few OOV terms with ambiguity, e.g., \"AARP\" (American Association of Retired Persons or AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol).",
        "(6) The ranking pattern based on the supervised learning is able to synthesize various feature representations for translation candidates.",
        "Thus the rank for a candidate can be precisely predicted through tagging and training."
