        "It has been recognized for quite some time that sustainable data formats play an important role in the development and curation of linguistic resources.",
        "As witnessed by the success of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and of published standards issued by the International Standards Organization (ISO), markup languages such as XML (short for: Extensible Markup Language) have become lingua francas for encoding linguistic resources of different types, including phonetic transcrip-",
        "Erhard Hinrichs",
        "erhard.hinrichs@uni-tuebingen.de",
        "tions, (annotated) text corpora, and dictionaries.",
        "It is fair to say that it has become common practice among developers of new linguistic resources to consult TEI guidelines and ISO standards in order to develop standard-conformant encoding schemes that serve as an interchange format and that can be documented and validated by Document Type Definitions (DTD) and XML schemata.",
        "However, for resources that were developed prior to or largely in parallel with the emerging acceptance of markup languages and of emerging encoding standards, the situation is far more heterogeneous.",
        "A wide variety of legacy formats exists, many of which have persisted due to existing user communities and the availability of tools that can process only such idiosyncratic formats.",
        "The development of wordnets for a large number of languages is a typical example of a type of linguistic resource, where legacy formats still persist as a de facto standard.",
        "WordNet 1.6 is encoded in the data format of lexicographer files that was designed for the English Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "It is a plain-text format for storing wordnet data and allows lexicographers to encode lexical and conceptual relations among lexical units and synsets by use of special-purpose diacritics.",
        "There exist numerous tools that can process WordNet 1.6 lexicographer files to extract relevant information or to transform the data into other special-purpose formats such as Prolog-fact databases.",
        "Even tough still widely used for the reasons just mentioned, the complexity of the format itself has a number of undesirable consequences.",
        "As Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have pointed out, the editing of lexicographer files is highly error-prone and time-consuming in actual lexicographic development.",
        "Moreover, format validation of the data as well as development of new tools for data visualization and data extraction become increasingly difficult since they cannot be based on generic state-of-the-art tools, that are, for example, available for XML-based encodings.",
        "For exactly these reasons, XML-based interchange formats have been proposed in recent years also for wordnets.",
        "One of the first, if not the first, example is the XML format for Ger-maNet, a wordnet for German (Lemnitzer and Kunze, 2002; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010).",
        "An even more recent development along these lines is the specification of Wordnet-LMF (see Soria et al., 2009), an instantiation of the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, (Francopoulo et al., 2006)) customized for wordnets.",
        "Since LMF is an ISO standard (ISO-24613), it is a particularly attractive candidate for encoding wordnets.",
        "Everything else being equal, ISO standards have a high chance of being adopted by a wide user community and of being recognized as an interchange format.",
        "Such agreed-upon interchange formats are a crucial prerequisite for interoperable linguistic resources in the context of web services and of processing pipelines for linguistic resources.",
        "The purpose of this paper is threefold:",
        "1.",
        "To compare and contrast the GermaNet XML initially proposed by Lemnitzer and Kunze (2002) with the Wordnet-LMF.",
        "This comparison is instructive since it reveals two completely different conceptions of representing semantic knowledge at the lexical level.",
        "2.",
        "To point out a number of open issues that need to be resolved if Wordnet-LMF is to be adopted widely among wordnets for a steadily increasing number of languages.",
        "3.",
        "To show how these open issues can be resolved in a customized version of Wordnet-LMF suitable for GermaNet.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a general introduction to GermaNet.",
        "Details about the adapted XML format used for GermaNet up until now are provided in section 3.",
        "Section 4 introduces the challenge of how to represent a wordnet in the Lexical Markup Framework.",
        "As one possibility, Wordnet-LMF is regarded.",
        "Issues that arise during the conversion of GermaNet into Wordnet-LMF lead to a modified version of Wordnet-LMF.",
        "Finally, section 5 concludes with a comparison of the two representation formats."
