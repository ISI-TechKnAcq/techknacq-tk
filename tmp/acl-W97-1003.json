        "Every headword is propagated up through the tree such that every parent receives a headword from the head-child.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example of a parse tree with headwords.",
        "Following the techniques suggested by (Collins, 1996), a parse tree can subsequently be described as a set of dependencies.",
        "Every word except the headword of the sentence depends on the lowest headword it is covered by.",
        "The syntactic relation is then given by the triple of nonterminals: the modifying nonterminal, the modified nonterminal, and the nonterminal that covers the joint phrase.",
        "Table 1 gives an example of such a description.",
        "On one point our method is different from the method suggested by Collins.",
        "Collins uses a reduced sentence in which every basic noun phrase (i.e., a noun phrase that has no noun phrase as a child) is reduced to its headword.",
        "The reason for this is that it improves co-occurrence counts and adjacency statistics.",
        "We however do not reduce the sentence",
        "since we do not need to consider adjacency statistics or unresolved ambiguities, and therefore never face the problem that a word in a basic noun phrase, that is not the headword, is adjacent to or modifies something outside of the basic noun phrase.",
        "Table 1 gives the relations for one sentence, but instead of considering one sentence we collect such patterns for the whole corpus and study statistics for individual words.",
        "In this way it can be discovered that, for example, a particular verb is often used transitively, or that a particular preposition is mostly used to produce locative prepositional phrases.",
        "Words can be distinct or similar in this respect, but note that this is not related to semantic similarity.",
        "Words such as eat and drink have a semantic similarity, but may be completely different in their syntactic behavior, whereas tend and appear do not have an obvious semantic relation, but they do have a similarity since they can both be used as raising verbs, as will be exemplified later.",

        "We have tried this distance measure, but in many cases we have found it to have undesirable effects, primarily because the goal of our algorithm is joining words (and their statistics) together to make one cluster, and a distorted image results from this measure when words have different total frequencies.",

        "In some of these applications words with a low frequency cannot be ignored because of their quantity, but at the same time the algorithm cannot rely too heavily on their observations.",
        "A possible solution is to carry out clustering without these words, and distribute the low-frequency words over the leaves of the tree afterwards.",
        "A solution along this line was chosen for co-occurrence based clustering in (McMahon and Smith, 1996), where a first algorithm handles more frequent words, and a second algorithm adds the low-frequency words afterwards."

        "We have presented a method which constructs classes of words with similar syntactic behavior, or binary trees that reflect word similarity, by clustering words using treebank data.",
        "In this way it is possible to discover particular types of behavior, such as the peculiar behavior of the gerund including, verbs that modify an entire clause (raising verbs), nouns that prefer either subject position or object position, or prepositions that prefer locative phrases.",
        "Most of the classes found in this way would not be found if clustering were performed on the basis of co-occurrences, as has been described in the literature.",
        "For example, the verbs [tend, plan, continue, want, need, seem, appear] share a particular sentence structure rather than, say, the sort of noun that becomes the object.",
        "As became clear from the case study of prepositions, the clustering process reveals similarities in the syntactic structure in which words appear which in some cases can be clearly felt by intuition.",
        "For example, the words in, on and at often are the head of locative prepositional phrases, and a preposition such as within usually is the head of a temporal prepositional phrase.",
        "Using this method these intuitions can be quantified.",
        "One of the applications we described is that of a decision-tree based system for syntactic analysis.",
        "We are currently applying the method in this application, which will be described in later publications."
