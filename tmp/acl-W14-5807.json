        "In recent years considerable amount of research has been performed on extracting semantic information from sentences.",
        "Revealing such information is usually achieved by identifying the complements (argu- ments) of a predicate and assigning meaningful labels to them.",
        "Each label represents the argument's relation to its predicate and is referred to as a semantic role and this task is named as semantic role labeling (SRL).",
        "There exists some comprehensive semantically interpreted corpora such as FrameNet and PropBank.",
        "These corpora, annotated with semantic roles, help researchers to specify SRL as a task, furthermore are used as training and test data for supervised machine learning methods (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006).",
        "These resources differ in type of semantic roles they use and type of additional information they provide.",
        "FrameNet (FN) is a semantic network, built around the theory of semantic frames.",
        "This theory describes a type of event, relation, or entity with their participants which are called frame elements (FEs).",
        "All predicates in same semantic frame share one set of FEs.",
        "A sample sentence annotated with FrameNet, VerbNet and PropBank conventions respectively, is given in Ex.",
        "1.",
        "The predicate ?buy?",
        "belongs to ?Commerce buy?, more generally ?Commercial transaction?",
        "frame of FrameNet which contains ?Buyer?, ?Goods?",
        "as core frame elements and ?Seller?",
        "as a non-core frame element as in Ex.",
        "1.",
        "FN also provides connections between semantic frames like inheritance, hierarchy and causativity.",
        "For example the frame ?Commerce buy?",
        "is connected to ?Importing?",
        "and ?Shopping?",
        "frames with ?used by?",
        "relation.",
        "Contrary to FN, VerbNet (VN) is a hierarchical verb lexicon, that contains categories of verbs based on Levin Verb classification (Schuler, 2006).",

        "is contained in ?get-13.5.1?",
        "class of VN, among with the verbs ?pick?, ?reserve?",
        "and ?book?.",
        "Members of same verb class share same set of semantic roles, referred to as thematic roles.",

        "Also, the only available morphologically and syntactically annotated treebank corpus: METU-Sabanci Dependency Treebank (Eryi?git et al., 2011), (Oflazer et al., 2003), (Atalay et al., 2003) has only about 5600 sentences, which has presumably a low coverage of Turkish verbs.",
        "VerbNet defines possible syntaxes for each class of verbs.",
        "However, due to free word order and excessive case marking system, syntactic information is already encoded with case markers in Turkish.",
        "Thus the structure of VerbNet does not fit well to the Turkish language.",
        "PropBank simplifies semantic roles, but defines neither relations between verbs nor all possible syntaxes for each verb.",
        "Moreover only Arg0 and Arg1 are associated with a specific semantic content, which reduces the consistency among labeled arguments.",
        "Due to lack of a large-scale treebank corpus, building a high coverage PropBank is currently not possible for Turkish.",
        "FrameNet defines richer relations between verbs, but the frame elements are extremely fine-grained and building such a comprehensive resource requires a great amount of manual work for which human resources are not currently available for Turkish.",
        "In this paper, we discuss how the semantic information supplied by morphemes, named as morphose-mantics, can be included in the construction of semantic resources for languages with less resources and rich morphologies, like Turkish.",
        "We try to show that we can decrease manual effort for building such banks and increase consistency and connectivity of the resource by exploiting derivational morphology of verbs; eliminate mapping costs by associating syntactic information with semantic roles and increase the performance of SRL and word sense disambiguation by directly using morphosemantic information supplied with inflectional morphology.",
        "Then, we perform a pilot study to build a lexical semantic resource that contains syntactic information as well as semantic information that is defined by semantic roles both in VerbNet and PropBank fashion, by exploiting morphological properties of Turkish language.",

        "In a similiar work (Mititelu, 2012), morphosemantic information is added to Romanian WordNet and the proposed application areas in Bilgin et al. (2004) are examined and shown to be feasible.",
        "Previous studies based on building Basque PropBank focus on the building process of Basque Prop-Bank, rather than analysis of the regularity of case markers and the relation between semantic roles and case markers.",
        "Furthermore, the study related to building Arabic Morphological Pattern Net, aims to build a seperate dataset and map it to other resources such as Arabic VerbNet, WordNet and PropBank.",
        "Word-47 Net has rich cross-language morphosemantic links however it does not list all arguments of predicates, thus its structure is not convenient for NLP tasks like semantic role labeling.",

        "This means 425 verbs can be automatically framed by applying the valency patterns to 233 root verbs.",
        "In this analysis we have only considered one sense of the verb since there may be cases where valency changing morpheme can not be applied to another sense of the verb.",

        "Moreover, a verb stem may have multiple senses.",
        "In that case automatically extracted argument transformation may be wrong, because the verb stem may have a completely different meaning.",
        "Turkish is not among rich languages by means of computational resources as discussed before.",
        "Turkish Language Association (TDK) is a trustworthy source for lexical datasets and dictionaries.",
        "To run this pilot study, we have used the list of Turkish root verbs provided by TDK and the TNC corpus 4 .",
        "The interface built for searching the TNC corpus gives the possibility to see all sentences that were built with the verb the user is searching for (Aksan and Aksan, 2012).",
        "The senses of the verbs and case marking of their arguments are decided by manually investigating the sentences appear in search results of the TNC corpus.",
        "Then, the arguments of the predicates are labeled with VerbNet thematic roles and PropBank argument numbers, by checking the English equivalent of Turkish verb sense.",
        "This process is repeated for all verb senses.",
        "For framing purposes, we have adjusted an already available open source software, cornerstone (Choi et al., 2010) 5 .",
        "To supply case marking information of the argument, a drop down menu containing six possible case markers in Turkish is added as shown in Fig 4a.",
        "Finally, another drop down menu that contains all possible suffixes that a Turkish verb can have is added, shown in Fig 4b.",
        "Theoretically, the number of possible derivations may be infinite for some Turkish verbs, due to its rich generative property.",
        "However, practically the average number of inflectional groups in a word is less than two (Oflazer et al., 2003).",
        "TDK provides a lexicon 6 for widely used verb stems derived from root verbs by a valency changing morpheme.",
        "To avoid framing a nonexisting verb, we have used a simple interface shown in Fig 4b to enter only the stems given by TDK.",
        "An example with the Turkish verb bin ?to ride?",
        "is given in Fig 4b.",
        "The first line defines that one can generate a stem bin-il ?to be ridden by someone?",
        "from the root bin by using the suffix l. Similiarly, second line illustrates a two layer derivational morphology, which can be interpreted as producing two verbs: bin-dir ?cause someone to ride something?",
        "and bin-dir-il ?to be caused by someone to ride something?.",
        "5 Experiments and Results In Table 8, number of co-occurences of each thematic role with each case marker are given.",
        "Since in PropBank only Arg0 and Arg1 have a certain semantic interpretation, we have used VerbNet thematic roles in our analysis.",
        "Some roles look highly related with a case marker, while some look arbitrary.",
        "Results can be interpreted in two ways: 1) If the semantic roles are known and case marker information is needed, Agent will be marked with NOM, Destination with DAT, Source with ABL and Recipient with DAT case with more than 0.98 probability, furthermore Patient and Theme can be restricted to NOM or ACC cases; 2) If case markers are known and semantic role information is needed, only restrictions and prior probabilities can be provided.",
        "Highest probabilities occur with COM-instrument, LOC-location, DAT-destination, ACC-Theme and NOM-Agent pairs.",

        "Our experimental results on 814 arguments showed that the first feature, case markers, are not arbitrarily linked with a semantic role.",
        "This brings us to a conclusion that they can be a distinguishing feature for SRL, word sense disambiguation and language generation tasks.",
        "We ran some experiments for the second feature, valency changing morphemes and observed that the transformation of the argument structures of root to stem follows a specific pattern, hence proposed transformation seems to be regular and predictable.",
        "The results suggest that argument configuration of the root verb may be enough to label any verb stem derived with valency changing morphemes.",
        "This gives us the ability to build a semantic resource in a shorter time and reduce the human error, as well as provide a direct relationship like ?causativity?, ?reflexivity?",
        "and ?reciprocity?",

        "5.",
        "To conclude, this study encourages us to continue using morphosemantic features and increase the size of this resource.",
