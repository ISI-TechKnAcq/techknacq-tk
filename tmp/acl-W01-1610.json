        "Compared to many other systems, spoken dialogue systems (SDS) tend to have more difficulties in correctly interpreting user input.",
        "Whereas a car will normally go left if the driver turns the steering wheel in that direction or a vacuum cleaner will start working if one pushes the on-button, interactions between a user and a spoken dialogue system are often hampered by mismatches between the action intended by the user and the action executed by the system.",
        "Such mismatches are mainly due to errors in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and/or the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component of these systems.",
        "To solve these mismatches, users often have to put considerable effort in trying to make it clear to the system that there was a problem, and trying to correct it by re-entering misrecognized or misinterpreted information.",
        "Previous research has already brought to light that it is not always easy for users to determine whether their intended actions were carried out correctly or not, in particular when the dialogue system does not give appropriate feedback about its internal representation at the right moment.",
        "In addition, users' corrections may miss their goal, because corrections themselves are more difficult for the system to recognize and interpret correctly, which may lead to so-called cyclic (or spiral) errors.",
        "That corrections are difficult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyper-articulated higher, louder, longer ... than other turns (Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al., 1996; Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999; Shimojima et al., 1999), where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style.",
        "The current paper focuses on user corrections, and looks at places where people first become aware of a system problem (\"aware sites\").",
        "In other papers (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001; Litman et al., 2001), we have already given some descriptive statistics on corrections and aware sites and we have been looking at methods to automatically predict these two utterance categories.",
        "One of our major findings is that prosody, which had already been shown to be a good predictor of misrecognitions (Litman et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2000), is also useful to correctly classify corrections and aware sites.",
        "In this paper, we will elaborate more on the exact labeling scheme we used, and add further descriptive statistics.",
        "More in particular, we address the question whether there is much variance in the way people react to system errors, and if so, to what extent this variance can be explained on the basis of particular properties of the dialogue system.",
        "In the following section we first provide details on the TOOT corpus that we used for our analyses.",
        "Then we give information on the labels for corrections and aware sites, and on the actual labeling procedure.",
        "The next section gives the results of some descriptive statistics on properties of corrections and aware sites and on their distributions.",
        "We will end the paper with a general discussion of our findings."

        "Our corpus consists of dialogues between human subjects and TOOT, a spoken dialogue system that allows access to train information from the web via telephone.",
        "TOOT was collected to study variations in dialogue strategy and in user-adapted interaction (Litman and Pan, 1999).",
        "It is implemented using an IVR (interactive voice response) platform developed at AT&T, combining ASR and text-to-speech with a phone interface (Kamm et al., 1997).",
        "The system's speech recognizer is a speaker-independent hidden Markov model system with context-dependent phone models for telephone speech and constrained grammars defining vocabulary at any dialogue state.",
        "The platform supports barge-in.",
        "Subjects performed four tasks with one of several versions of the system that differed in terms of locus of initiative (system, user, or mixed), confirmation strategy (explicit, implicit, or none), and whether these conditions could be changed by the user during the task (adaptive vs. non-adaptive).",
        "TOOT's initiative",
        "strategy specifies who has control of the dialogue, while TOOT's confirmation strategy specifies how and whether TOOT lets the user know what it just understood.",
        "The fragments in Figure 1 provide some illustrations of how dialogues vary with strategy.",
        "Subjects were 39 students; 20 native speakers and 19 nonnative, 16 female and 23 male.",
        "Dialogues were recorded and system and user behavior logged automatically.",
        "The concept accuracy (CA) of each turn was manually labeled.",
        "If the ASR correctly captured all task-related information in the turn (e.g. time, departure and arrival cities), the turn's CA score was 1 (semantically correct).",
        "Otherwise, the CA score reflected the percentage of correctly recognized task information in the turn.",
        "The dialogues were also transcribed and automatically scored in comparison to the ASR recognized string to produce a word error rate (WER) for each turn.",
        "For the study described below, we examined 2328 user turns (all user input between two system inputs) from 152 dialogues."

      "text": [
        "To identify corrections' in the corpus two authors independently labeled each turn as to whether or not it constituted a correction of a prior system failure (a rejection or CA error, which were the only system failure subjects were aware of) and subsequently decided upon a consensus label.",
        "Note that much of the discrepancies between labels were due to tiredness or incidental sloppiness of individual annotators, rather than true disagreement.",
        "Each turn labeled `correction' was further classified as belonging to one of the following categories: REP (repetition, including repetitions with differences in pronunciation or fluency), PAR (paraphrase), ADD (task-relevant content added, OMIT (content omitted), and ADD/OMIT (content both added and omitted).",
        "Repetitions were further divided into repetitions with pronunciation variation (PRON) (e.g. yes correcting yeah), and repetitions where the correction was pronounced using the same pronunciation as the original turn, but this distinction was difficult to make and turned out not to be useful.",
        "User turns which included both corrections and other speech acts were so distinguished by labeling them \"2+\".",
        "For user turns containing a correction plus one or more additional dialogue acts, only the correction is used for purposes of analysis below.",
        "We also labeled as restarts user corrections which followed non-initial system-initial prompts (e.g. \"How may I help you?\" or \"What city do you want to go to?\"); in such cases system and user essentially started the dialogue over from the beginning.",
        "Figure 2 shows examples of each correction type and additional label for corrections of system failures on I want to go to Boston on Sunday.",
        "Note that the utterance on the last line of this figure is labeled 2+PAR, given that this turn consist of two speech acts: the goal of the no-part of this 'The labels discussed in this section for corrections and aware sites may well be related to more general dialogue acts, like the ones proposed by (Allen and Core, 1997), but this needs to be explored in more detail in the future.",
        "turn is to signal a problem, whereas the remainder of this turn serves to correct a prior error.",
        "Each correction was also indexed with an identifier representing the closest prior turn it was correcting, so that we could investigate \"chains\" of corrections of a single failed turn, by tracing back through subsequent corrections of that turn.",
        "Figure 3 shows a fragment of a TOOT dialogue with corrections labeled as discussed above.",
        "We also identified aware sites in our corpus turns where a user, while interacting with a machine, first becomes aware that the system has misrecognized a previous user turn.",
        "For our corpus, we tried to determine whether there was some evidence in the user turn indicating that the user had become aware of a mistake in the system's understanding of a previous user turn, and, if so, which previous turn had occasioned that error.",
        "Note that such aware sites may or may not also be corrections (another type of post-misrecognition turn), since a user may not immediately provide correcting information.",
        "Also, it may take a while before the user is able to notice a system error.",
        "Figure 4 shows an example that illustrates cases in which both the user's awareness and correction of a misrecognition occur in the same turn (e.g. turns 1159 and 1160, after system prompts for information already given in turn 1158).",
        "It also illustrates cases in which aware sites and corrections occur in different turns.",
        "For example, after the immediate explicit system confirmation of turn 1162, the user first becomes aware of the system errors",
        "(turn 1163), then separately corrects them (turn 1164).",
        "When no immediate confirmation of an utterance occurs (as with turn 1158), it may take several turns before the user becomes aware of any misrecognition errors.",
        "For example, it is not until turn 1161 that the user first becomes aware of the error in date and time from 1158; the user then corrects the error in 1162.",
        "Of all turns in our corpus, 13% represent cases of turns that are only corrections, 14% are only aware sites, and 16% are turns where aware sites and corrections co-occur.",
        "Also, note that turns 1162 and 1164 in this dialogue fragment represent cases of restarts after a system-initial, non-initial prompt ( �How may I help you?\") ."

        "We identified 29% of the turns in the corpus as corrections.",
        "These were a serious problem for the system, being misrecognized in terms of transcription error about twice as often (61%) as non-corrections (33%) and in terms of concept error in 53% of cases for corrections compared with 21% concept error for non-corrections.",
        "Corrections differed from non-corrections in other ways as well, which are suggestive of how they might be identified by an SDS.",
        "We have previously discussed the prosodic and acoustic differences between corrections and non-correction (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001).",
        "In particular, in line with previous studies, we found that corrections more often tend to be hyperarticulated (longer, louder, with great pitch excursions,...) than other turns.",
        "More recently we have also discovered differences in other dimensions.",
        "First, corrections appear to be longer than non-corrections in numbers of words, when we examine actual human transcriptions of",
        "them, both in absolute terms (T=17.68; df=2326; p=0) and also controlling for speaker (T=5.32; df=38; p=0).",
        "Even the ASR hypotheses show this difference, with hypotheses of corrections being longer in absolute terms (T=13.72; df=2326; p=0) and across speakers (T=5.18; df=38; p=0).",
        "Of the correction types we labeled, the largest number were REPs and OMITs, as shown in Table 1, which shows overall distribution of correction types, and distributions for each type of system failure corrected.",
        "Table 1 shows that 39% of TOOT corrections were simple repetitions of the previously misrecognized turn.",
        "While this strategy is often suboptimal in correcting ASR errors (Levow, 1998), REPs (45% error) and OMITs (52% error) were better recognized than ADDs (90% error) and PARs (72% error).",
        "Thus, overall, users tend to have a preference for correction types that are more likely to be succesful.",
        "That REPs and OMITs are more often correctly recognized can be linked to the observation that they tend to be realized with prosody which is less marked than the prosody on ADDs and PARs.",
        "Table 2 shows that REPs and OMITs are closer to normal utterances in terms of their prosodic features than ADDs, which are considerably higher, longer and slower.",
        "This is in line with our previous observations that marked settings for these prosodic features more often lead to recognition errors.",
        "What the user was correcting also influenced the type of correction chosen.",
        "Table 1 shows that corrections of misrecognitions (Post-Mrec) were more likely to omit information present in the original turn (OMITs), while corrections of rejections (Post-Rej) were more likely to be simple repetitions.",
        "The latter finding is not surprising, since the rejection message for tasks was always a close paraphrase of \"Sorry, I can't understand you.",
        "Can you please repeat your utterance?\" However, it does suggest the surprising power of system directions, and how important it is to craft prompts to favor the type of correction most easily recognized by the system.",
        "Corrections following system restarts differed in type somewhat from other corrections, with more turns adding new material to the correction and fewer of them repeating",
        "the original turn.",
        "Dialogue strategy clearly affected the type of correction users made.",
        "For example, users more frequently repeat their misrecognized utterance in the SystemExplicit condition, than in the MixedImplicit or UserNoConfirm; the latter conditions have larger proportions of OMITs and ADDs.",
        "This is an important observation given that this suggests that some dialogue strategies lead to correction types, such as ADDs, which are more likely to be misrecognized than correction types elicited by other strategies.",
        "As noted above, corrections in the TOOT corpus often take the form of chains of corrections of a single original error.",
        "Looking back at Figure 3, for example, we see two chains of corrections: In the first, which begins with the misrecognition of turn 776 (\"Um, tomor-row\"), the user repeats the original phrase and then provides a paraphrase (\"Saturday\"), which is correctly recognized.",
        "In the second, beginning with turn 780, the time of departure is misrecognized.",
        "The user omits some information (\"am\") in turn 781, but without success; an ADD correction follows, with the previously omitted information restored, in turn 783.",
        "Elsewhere (Swerts et al.",
        "2000), we have shown that chain position has an influence on correction behaviour in the sense that more distant corrections tend to be misrecognized more often than corrections closer to the original error."

        "If a system would be able to detect aware sites with a reasonable accuracy, this would be useful, given that the system would then be able to correctly guess in the majority of the cases that the problem occurred in the preceding turn.",

        "In other words, both types of post-error utterances, i.e., corrections and aware sites, share the fact that they tend to lead to additional errors.",
        "But whereas we have shown above that for corrections this is probably caused by the fact that these utterances are uttered in a hyperarticulated speaking style, we do not find differences in hyper-articulation between aware sites and `normal utterances' (T= 0.9085; df=38; p=0.3693).",
        "This could mean that these sites are realized in a speaking style which is not perceptibly different from normal speaking style",
        "when judged by human labelers, but which is still sufficiently different to cause problems for an ASR system.",
        "In terms of distinguishing features which might explain or help to identify these turns, we have previously examined the acoustic and prosodic features of aware sites (Litman et al., 2001).",
        "Here we present some additional features.",
        "Aware sites appear to be significantly shorter, in general, than other turns, both in absolute terms and controlling for speaker variation, and whether we examine the ASR transcription (absolute: T=4.86; df=2326; p=0; speaker-controlled: T=5.37; df=38; p=0) or the human one (absolute: T=3.45; df=2326; p<.0001; speaker-controlled: T=4.69; df=38; p=0).",
        "A sizable but not overwhelming number of aware sites in fact consist of a simple negation (i.e., a variant of the word `no') (see Table 4).",
        "This at the same time shows that a simple no-detector will not be sufficient as an indicator of aware sites (see also (Krahmer et al., 1999; Krahmer et al., to appear)), given that most aware sites are more complex than that, such as turns 1159 and 1160 in the example of Figure 4.",
        "More concretely, Table 4 shows that a single no would correctly predict that the turn is an aware site with a precision of only 57% and a recall of only 23%."

        "If aware sites are detectable, they can function as backward-looking error-signaling devices, making it clear to the system that something has gone wrong in the preceding context, so that, for example, the system can reprompt for information.",
        "In this way, they are similar to what others have termed `go-back' signals (Krahmer et al., 1999).",
        "Aware sites can also be used as forward-looking signals, indicating upcoming corrections or more drastic changes in user behavior, such as complete restarts of the task.",
        "Given that, in current systems, both corrections and restarts often lead to recognition error (Swerts et al., 2000), aware sites may be useful in preparing systems to deal with such problems.",
