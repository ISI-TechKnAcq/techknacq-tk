        "Over the last decade technological advances have been made which enable us to envision real-world applications of speech technologies.",

        "Other applications may require accurate identification of the speaker for security reasons, including control of access to confidential information or for telephone-based transactions.",
        "Ideally, the speaker's identity can be verified continually during the transaction, in a manner completely transparent to the user.",
        "With these views in mind, this paper presents a unified approach to identifying non-linguistic speech features from the recorded signal using phone-based acoustic likelihoods.",
        "This technique is shown to be effective for text-independent language, sex, and speaker identification and can enable better and more friendly human-machine interaction.",
        "With 2s of speech, the language can be identified with better than 99% accuracy.",
        "Error in sex-identification is about 1% on a per-sentence basis, and speaker identification accuracies of 98.5% on TIMIT (168 speakers) and 99.2% on BREF (65 speakers), were obtained with one utterance per speaker, and 100% with 2 utterances for both corpora.",

        "As speech recognition technology advances, so do the aims of system designers, and the prospects of potential applications.",
        "One of the main efforts underway in the community is the development of speaker-independent, task-independent large vocabulary speech recognizers that can easily be adapted to new tasks.",
        "It is becoming apparent that many of the portability issues may depend more on the specification of the task, and the ergonomy, than on the performance of the speech recognition component itself.",
        "The acceptance of speech technology in the world at large will depend on how well the technology can be integrated in systems which simplify the life of the users.",
        "This in turns means that the service provided by such a system must be easy to use, and as fast as other providers of the service (i.e., such as using a human operator).",
        "While the focus has been on improving the performance of the speech recognizers, it is also of interest to be able to identify what we refer to as some of the \"non-linguistic\" speech features present in the acoustic signal.",
        "For example, it is possible to envision applications where the spoken query is to be recognized without prior knowledge of the language being spoken.",
        "This is the case for information centers in public places, such as train stations and airports, where the language may change from one user to the next.",
        "The ability to automatically identify the language being spoken, and to respond appropriately, is possible.",
        "Other applications, such as for financial or banking transactions, or access to confidential information, such as financial, medical or insurance records, etc., require accurate identification or verification of the user.",
        "Typically security is provided by the human who \"recognizes\" the voice of the client he is used to dealing with (and often will also be confirmed by a fax), or for automated systems by the use of cards and/or codes, which must be provided in order to access the data.",
        "With the widespread use of telephones, and the new payment and information retrieval services offered by telephone, it is a logical extension to explore the use of speech for user identification.",
        "An advantage is that if text-independent speaker verification techniques are used, the speaker's identity can be continually verified during the transaction, in a manner completely transparent to the user.",
        "This can avoid the problems encountered by theft or duplication of cards, and prerecording of the user's voice during an earlier transaction.",
        "With these future views in mind, this paper presents a unified approach for identifying non-linguistic speech features, such as the language being spoken, and the identity or sex of the speaker, using phone-based acoustic likelihoods.",
        "The basic idea is similar to that of using sex-dependent models for recognition, but instead of the output being the recognized string, the output is the characteristic associated with the model set having the highest likelihood.",
        "This approach has been evaluated for French/English language identification, and speaker and sex identification in both languages."

        "The basic idea is to train a set of large phone-based ergodic hidden Markov models (HMMs) for each non-linguistic feature to be identified (language, gender, speaker, ...).",
        "Feature identification on the incoming signal x is then performed by computing the acoustic likelihoods f (xl i) for all the models Ai of a given set.",
        "The feature value corresponding to the model with the highest likelihood is then hypothesized.",
        "This",
        "decoding procedure can efficiently be implemented by processing all the models in parallel using a time-synchronous beam search strategy.",
        "This approach has the following advantages:",
        "• It can perform text-independent feature recognition.",
        "(Text-dependent feature recognition can also be performed.)",
        "• It is more precise than methods based on long-term statistics such as long term spectra, VQ codebooks, or probabilistic acoustic maps [26, 281.",
        "• It can easily take advantage of phonotactic constraints.",
        "(These are shown to be useful for language identification.)",
        "• It can easily be integrated in recognizers which are based",
        "on phone models as all the components already exist.",
        "A disadvantage of the approach is that, at least in the current formulation, phonetic labels are required for training the models.",
        "However, there is in theory no absolute need for phonetic labeling of the speech training data to estimate the HMM parameters.",
        "Labeling of a small portion of the training data can be enough to bootstrap the training procedure and insure the phone-based nature of the resulting models.",
        "(In this case, phonotactic constraints must be obtained only from speech corpora.)",
        "We have sucessfully experimented with this approach for speaker identification.",
        "In our implementation, each large ergodic HMM is built from small left-to-right phonetic HMMs.",
        "The Viterbi algorithm is used to compute the joint likelihood f (x, s I A) of the incoming signal and the most likely state sequence instead of f (xIAi).",
        "This implementation is therefore nothing more than a slightly modified phone recognizer with language-, sex-, or speaker dependent model sets used in parallel, and where the output phone string is ignored and only the acoustic likelihood for each model is taken into account.",
        "The phone recognizer can use either context-dependent or context-independent phone models, where each phone model is a 3-state left-to-right continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) with Gaussian mixture observation densities.",
        "The covariance matrices of all Gaussian components are diagonal.",
        "Duration is modeled with a gamma distribution per phone model.",
        "As proposed by Rabiner et al.",
        "[23], the HMM and duration parameters are estimated separately and combined in the recognition process for the Viterbi search.",
        "Maximum likelihood estimators are used to derive language specific models whereas maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators are used to generate sex and speaker specific models as has already been proposed in [11].",
        "The MAP estimates are obtained with the segmental MAP algorithm [16, 9, 101 using speaker-independent seed models.",
        "These seed models are used to estimate the parameters of the prior densities and to serve as an initial estimate for the segmental MAP algorithm.",
        "This approach provides a way to incorporate prior information into the model training process and is 'The likelihood computation can in fact be simplified since there is no need to maintain the backtracking information necessary to know the recognized phone sequence.",
        "particularly useful to build the speaker specific models when using only a small amount of speaker specific data.",
        "In our earlier reported results using this approach for language and speaker-identification[13, 14, 71, the acoustic likelihoods were computed sequentially for each of the models.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the Viterbi decoder is now implemented as a one-pass beam search procedure applied on all the models in parallel, resulting in an efficient decoding procedure which saves a lot of computation."

        "In this paper we have reported on recent work on the identification of non-linguistic speech features from recorded signals using phone-based acoustic likelihoods.",
        "The inclusion of this technique in speech-based systems, can broaden the scope of applications of speech technologies, and lead to more user-friendly systems.",
        "The approach is based on training a set of large phone-based ergodic HMMs for each non-linguistic feature to be identified (language, gender, speaker, ...), and identifying the feature as that associated with the model having the highest acoustic likelihood of the set.",
        "The decoding procedure is efficiently implemented by processing all the models in parallel using a time-synchronous beam search strategy.",
        "This has been shown to be a powerful technique for sex-, language-, and speaker-identification, and has other possible applications such as for dialect identification (including foreign accents), or identification of speech disfluencies.",
        "Sex-identification for BREF and WSJ was error-free, and 99% accurate for TIMIT with 2s of speech.",
        "With 2s of speech the language is correctly identified as English or French with over 99% accuracy.",
        "Speaker identification accuracies of 98.5% on TIMIT (168 speakers) and 99.1% on BREF (65 speakers) were obtained with one utterance per speaker, and 100% if 2 utterances were used for identification.",
        "The same identification accuracy was obtained on the 168 speakers of TIMIT using unsupervised adaptation, verifying that it is not necessary to provide phonetic transcription for accurate speaker identification.",
        "Being independent of the spoken text, and requiring only a small amount of speech (on the order of 2.5s), this technique is promising for a variety of applications, particularly those for which continual verification is preferable.",
        "In conclusion, we propose a unified approach to identifying non-linguistic speech features from the recorded signal using phone-based acoustic likelihoods.",
        "This technique has been shown to be effective for language, sex, and speaker identification and can enable better and more friendly human machine interaction."
