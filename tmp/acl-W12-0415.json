        "The paper proposes to use Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) analytic framework to identify systematic differences between deceptive and truthful stories in terms of their coherence and structure.",
        "A sample of 36 elicited personal stories, self-ranked as completely truthful or completely deceptive, is manually analyzed by assigning RST discourse relations among a story's constituent parts.",
        "Vector Space Model (VSM) assesses each story's position in multidimensional RST space with respect to its distance to truth and deceptive centers as measures of the story's level of deception and truthfulness.",
        "Ten human judges evaluate if each story is deceptive or not, and assign their confidence levels, which produce measures of the human expected deception and truthfulness levels.",
        "The paper contributes to deception detection research and RST twofold: a) demonstration of discourse structure analysis in pragmatics as a prominent way of automated deception detection and, as such, an effective complement to lexico-semantic analysis, and b) development of RST-VSM methodology to interpret RST analysis in identification of previously unseen deceptive texts.",
        "Introduction Automated deception detection is a challenging task (DePaulo, Charlton, Cooper, Lindsay, and Muhlenbruck, 1997), only recently proven feasible with natural language processing and machine learning techniques (Bachenko, Fitzpatrick, and Schonwetter, 2008; Fuller, Biros, and Wilson, 2009; Hancock, Curry, Goorha, and Woodworth, 2008; Rubin, 2010; Zhou, Burgoon, Nunamaker, and Twitchell, 2004).",
        "The idea is to distinguish truthful information from deceptive, where deception usually implies an intentional and knowing attempt on the part of the sender to create a false belief or false conclusion in the mind of the receiver of the information (e.g., Buller and Burgoon, 1996; Zhou, et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper we focus solely on textual information, in particular, in computer-mediated personal communications such as emails or online posts.",
        "Previously suggested techniques for detecting deception in text reach modest accuracy rates at the level of lexico-semantic analysis.",
        "Certain lexical items are considered to be predictive linguistic cues, and could be derived, for examples, from the Statement Validity Analysis techniques used in law enforcement for credibility assessments (as in Porter and Yuille, 1996).",
        "Though there is no clear consensus on reliable predictors of deception, deceptive cues are identified in texts, extracted and clustered conceptually, for instance, to represent diversity, complexity, specificity, and non-immediacy of the analyzed texts (e.g., Zhou, Burgoon, Nunamaker, and Twitchell (2004)).",
        "When implemented with standard classification algorithms (such as neural nets, decision trees, and logistic regression), such methods achieve 74% accuracy (Fuller, et al., 2009).",
        "Existing psycholinguistic lexicons (e.g., LWIC by Pennebaker and Francis, 1999) have been adapted to perform binary text classifications for truthful versus deceptive opinions, with an average classifier demonstrating 70% accuracy rate (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009).",
        "These modest results, though usually achieved on restricted topics, are promising since they supersede notoriously unreliable human abilities in lie-truth discrimination tasks.",
        "On average, people are not very good at spotting lies (Vrij, 2000), succeeding generally only about half of the time (Frank, Paolantinio, Feeley, and",
        "Servoss, 2004).",
        "For instance, a meta-analytical review of over 100 experiments with over 1,000 participants, showed a 54% mean accuracy rate at identifying deception (DePaulo, et al., 1997).",
        "Human judges achieve 50 ?",
        "63% success rates, depending on what is considered deceptive on a seven-point scale of truth-to-deception continuum (Rubin and Conroy, 2011, Rubin and Conroy, 2012), but the higher the actual self-reported deception level of the story, the more likely a story would be confidently assigned as deceptive.",
        "In other words, extreme degrees of deception are more transparent to judges.",
        "The task for current automated deception detection techniques has been formulated as binary text categorization ?",
        "is a message deceptive or truthful ?",
        "and the decision applies to the whole analyzed text.",
        "Since it is an overall discourse level decision, it may be reasonable to consider discourse or pragmatic features of each message.",
        "Thus far, discourse is surprisingly rarely considered, if at all, and the majority of the effort has been restricted to lexico-semantic verbal predictors.",
        "A rare exception up to date has been a Bachenko, Fitzpatrick and Schonwetter's (2008) study that focuses on truth or falsity of individual propositions, achieving a finer-grained level of analysis 1 , but the propositional interrelations within the discourse structure are not considered.",
        "To the best of our knowledge there have been no advances in that automation deception detection task to incorporate discourse structure features and/or text coherence analysis at the pragmatic levels of story interpretation.",
        "Study Objective With the recent advances in the identification of verbal cues of deception in mind, and the realization that they focus on linguistic levels below discourse and pragmatic analysis, the study focuses on one main question: ?",
        "What is the impact of the relations between discourse constituent parts on the discourse composition of deceptive and truthful messages?",
        "We hypothesize that if the relations between discourse constituent parts in deceptive messages differ from the ones in truthful messages, then systematic analysis of such relations will help to 1 Using a corpus of criminal statements, police interrogations and legal testimonies, their regression and tree-based classification automatic tagger performs at average 69% recall and 85% precision rates, as compared to the performance of human taggers on the same subset (Bachenko, et al., 2008).",
        "detect deception.",
        "To investigate this question, we propose to use a novel methodology for deception detection research, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) analysis with subsequent application of the Vector Space Model (VSM).",
        "RST analysis is promising in deception detection, since RST analysis captures coherence of a story in terms of functional relations among different meaningful text units, and describes a hierarchical structure of each story (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "The result is that each story is a set of RST relations connected in a hierarchical manner with more salient text units heading this hierarchical tree.",
        "We also propose to utilize the VSM model for conversion of the derived RST relations?",
        "frequencies into meaningful clusters of diverse deception levels.",
        "To evaluate the proposed RST-VSM methodology of deception detection in texts, we compare human assessment to the RST-analysis of deception levels for the sets of deceptive and truthful stories.",
        "The main findings demonstrate that RST resembles, to some degree, human judges in deceptive and truthful stories, and RST deception detection in self-rated deceptive stories has greater consistency than in truthful ones, which signifies the prominence of using RST-VSM methodology for deception detection 2 .",
        "However, RST conclusions regarding levels of deception in the truthful stories requires further research about the diversity of RST relations for the expressions of truths and deception as well as the types of clustering algorithms most suitable for clustering unevaluated by human judges?",
        "written communication in RST space to detect deception with certain degree of precision.",
        "The paper has three main parts.",
        "The next part discusses methodological foundations of RST-VSM approach.",
        "Then, the data and collection method describe the sample.",
        "Finally, the results section demonstrates the identified levels of deception and truthfulness as well as their distribution across truthful and deceptive stories."

        "For example, one of the RST relations, which appear in truthful stories and never appear in the deceptive stories in our sample, is EVIDENCE.",

        "For some reason, the RST coding of 18 deceptive stories has never used EVIDENCE, but used it rather often in 18 truthful stories.",

        "We propose to use a vector space model for the identification of these sets of RST relations.",

        "Using a vector space model, the written stories could be represented as RST vectors in a high dimensional space (Salton and McGill 1983, Manning and Schutse 1999).",
        "According to the VSM, stories are represented as vectors, and the dimension of the vector space equals to the number of RST relations in a set of all written stories under consideration.",

        "Our contribution to deception detection research and RST twofold: a) we demonstrate that discourse structure analysis and pragmatics as a promising way of automated deception detection and, as such, an effective complement to lexico-semantic analysis, and b) we develop the unique RST-VSM methodology of interpreting RST analysis in identification of previously unseen deceptive texts."
