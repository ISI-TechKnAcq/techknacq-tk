        "We attempt to resolve these problems by having annotators indicate correspondences in pairs of equivalent sentences.",
        "Rather than having people enumerate paraphrases, we asked that they perform the simper task of aligning paraphrases.",

        "While the creation of this data does require some effort, it seems to be a manageable amount, and the inter-annofator agreement seems reasonable.",

        "Future studies should examine how well these scores rank different paraphrasing methods when compared to human judgments.",
        "Follow up work should investigate the number of equivalent English sentences that are required for reasonably complete lists of paraphrases.",
        "In this work we aligned sets of eleven different English sentences, but we acknowledge that such a data set is rare and might make it difficult to port this method to other domains or languages.",
        "The goal of this work is to develop a set of scores that both allows different paraphrasing techniques to be compared objectively and provides an easily repeafable method for automatically evaluating paraphrases.",
        "This has hitherto not been possible.",
        "The availability of an objective, automatic evaluation metric for paraphrasing has the potential to impact research in the area in a number of ways.",
